1,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock.

2,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."

40,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
41,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes: each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
42,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
43,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
44,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
45,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
46,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
47,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
48,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p which could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
49,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
50,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
51,"DN1pC and DN1pE are each comprised of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD is comprised of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD is comprised of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
52,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is in fact morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
53,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
54,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
55,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
56,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
57,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
58,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than 4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than 9 synapses as strong connections."
59,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
60,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
61,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
62,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
63,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
64,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
65,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
66,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in advancing our understanding of chronobiology."
67,"Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
68,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
69,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
70,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
71,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 line and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
72,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. We deciphered light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons. Following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
73,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
74,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
75,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells that provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
76,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons, that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
77,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
78,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
79,"This is not surprising since light is the most important zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
80,"Regardless, we found little direct input from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings, which revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized the indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
81,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
82,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
83,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
84,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
85,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
86,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in approximately 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineates the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms, which remains a major focus in chronobiology."
87,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, particularly the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
88,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
89,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
90,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons that could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
91,"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified, as well as allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
92,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
93,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons, ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
94,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells, which influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
95,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
96,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
97,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
98,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
99,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
100,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
101,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
102,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are therefore not endocrine."
103,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somas compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
104,"Thus, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
105,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
106,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derives from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, the lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
107,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
108,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic pathways combine with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
109,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
110,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters, including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody and DH44-T2A-Gal4."
111,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters, such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut, remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
112,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
113,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSCs that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSCs are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSCs, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
114,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
115,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSCs. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSCs."
116,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcripts are highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
117,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
118,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
119,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
120,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
121,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
122,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
123,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we do not account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities, since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
124,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
125,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded the identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
126,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters, while excluding l-LNv and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN neurons represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
127,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
128,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
129,"Similar neuropeptide co-expression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
130,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
131,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
132,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
133,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
134,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
135,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
136,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that are sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
137,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
138,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
139,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock. Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
140,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
141,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach. The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
142,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements the synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
143,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons of sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
144,"Furthermore, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. Conclusion In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
145,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
146,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
147,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
148,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
149,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuits because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
150,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
151,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions generated by the computational model using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
152,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
153,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum or the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
154,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering based on connectivity and comparing this clustering with response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, activation of appetitive GRNs results in activation of proboscis motor neurons."
155,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
156,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
157,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
158,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
159,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
160,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
161,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
162,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
163,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared to control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
164,"In general, silencing individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
165,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
166,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
167,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
168,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
169,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to differ from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
170,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
171,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
172,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
173,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
174,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of these 11 cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
175,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
176,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
177,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
178,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
179,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
180,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
181,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
182,"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
183,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive tastes."
184,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
185,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
186,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
187,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
188,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
189,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
190,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
191,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
192,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
193,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
194,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
195,"Furthermore, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
196,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
197,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
198,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
199,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1; a descending member of the BN2 class; and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
200,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
201,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
202,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
203,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
204,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for the activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
205,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
206,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
207,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
208,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
209,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
210,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
211,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, this framework can correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
212,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits with extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
213,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
214,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger primarily impacts sugar-sensing neurons and select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
215,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impacting pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
216,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal states, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
217,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains but does not dictate a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
218,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
219,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
220,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
221,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
222,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and recently in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may arise from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also from a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
223,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium circadian rhythms. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
224,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays influenced by environmental light and by noncell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we start by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
225,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, employing a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods allowed us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
226,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, similar to previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
227,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
228,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results show that the rhythms of slow and fast calcium activity changes exhibit similar daily patterns."
229,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
230,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1 and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are, in fact, distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
231,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
232,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around the same ZT8 to ZT12, at which point this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of “fast” calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
233,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
234,"In doing so, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
235,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
236,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. To normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
237,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen was conducted to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
238,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources of different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
239,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three, as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
240,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
241,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
242,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
243,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely abnormal. The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely abnormal when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
244,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
245,"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-hour light:12-hour dark time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies. Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
246,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
247,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
248,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways, which generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling, can provide mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
249,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and the resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture, as well as the neuronal network motifs, are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
250,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of Lateral and Dorsal Neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are, consequently, distinct functionally."
251,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons, as well as their output pathways."
252,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional Dorsal Neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
253,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of Dorsal Neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
254,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
255,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
256,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
257,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
258,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
259,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
260,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
261,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
262,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
263,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
264,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
265,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
266,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture, as well as the neuronal network motifs, are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
267,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
268,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
269,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is in fact comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
270,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
271,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways.

272,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
273,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
274,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
275,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
276,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
277,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers.

279,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
280,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p, which could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
281,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with Clk4."
282,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
283,"DN1pC and DN1pE each consist of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD consists of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD comprises two morphologically distinct subtypes."
284,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
285,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classifications."
286,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- neurons from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
287,"Similarly, the two DN2 neurons are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
288,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 neurons cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
289,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
290,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than four common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than nine synapses as strong connections."
291,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
292,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
293,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
294,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
295,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
296,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
297,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
298,"Taken together, our analyses revealed hitherto unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
299,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
300,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
301,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
302,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 lines and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
303,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
304,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
305,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
306,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells, which provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
307,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
308,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ and ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
309,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
310,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
311,"Regardless, we found little direct inputs from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings that revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
312,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of more than four synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
313,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to over 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
314,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
315,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
316,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of over 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
317,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in about 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineates the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms, remaining a major focus in chronobiology."
318,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
319,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
320,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these Clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provide strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
321,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons that could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
322,"These descending neurons include those that have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
323,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
324,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
325,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells that influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
326,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
327,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
328,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
329,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
330,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC, comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
331,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC, comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
332,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
333,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSC CRZ neurons. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
334,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
335,"Therefore, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
336,"The only exceptions are l-NSC DH31, which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
337,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derives from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
338,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
339,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2A Gal4 lines would be evident. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
340,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
341,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody and DH44-T2A-Gal4."
342,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
343,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which was labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
344,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC which have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
345,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers, and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
346,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
347,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcripts are highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
348,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
349,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
350,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
351,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
352,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
353,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
354,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we do not account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
355,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
356,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
357,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters while excluding l-LNv and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN in fact represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p play a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appear important for clock output pathways."
358,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
359,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN express four neuropeptides."
360,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
361,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
362,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but has so far not been observed in fruit flies."
363,"In addition, consistent with previous analysis using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
364,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which has been shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
365,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks suggest that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
366,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
367,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that are sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
368,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partially parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
369,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time, which can occur at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
370,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock suggests that since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
371,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
372,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach indicate that the novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
373,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
374,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
375,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation, which is linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
376,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function, suggesting that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
377,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
378,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
379,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 were common between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
380,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuits because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
381,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits the analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
382,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
383,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
384,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum and the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
385,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
386,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
387,"In total, we find that the computational model can simulate a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
388,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed toward the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
389,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
390,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
391,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
392,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits, and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
393,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two additional in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
394,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
395,"In general, silencing individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
396,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
397,"Of these ten neurons, eight are correctly predicted to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
398,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
399,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
400,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
401,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
402,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the predictions of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
403,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
404,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
405,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
406,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
407,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
408,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
409,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
410,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
411,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
412,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
413,"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
414,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
415,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
416,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
417,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
418,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
419,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
420,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
421,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
422,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water, but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
423,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
424,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
425,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
426,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
427,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
428,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
429,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
430,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1, a descending member of the BN2 class, and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
431,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
432,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-C and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-C and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-C neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
433,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
434,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
435,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for the activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
436,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
437,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in these circuits."
438,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
439,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
440,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length, rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
441,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
442,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
443,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
444,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding: our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
445,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger impacts primarily sugar-sensing neurons and select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
446,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
447,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology, as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal states, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
448,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains but does not dictate a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
449,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
450,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day–night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
451,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
452,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
453,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and, recently, in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may derive from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also from a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
454,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven CCRs. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
455,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays influenced by environmental light and by non-cell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we start by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
456,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, here using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2. The acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods permitted us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods allow us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
457,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
458,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
459,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results: The Rhythms of Slow and Fast Calcium Activity Changes Show Similar Daily Patterns."
460,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
461,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1, and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are in fact distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
462,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
463,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of ""fast"" calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
464,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
465,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable to those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
466,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
467,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
468,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
469,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
470,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
471,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of the expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
472,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
473,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
474,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely altered. The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely altered when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
475,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and ITPR channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
476,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
477,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
478,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
479,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
480,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded as being comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
481,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
482,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
483,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
484,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center that regulates systemic physiology."
485,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded as being comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
486,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes: each of lateral neurons (LN) and dorsal neurons (DN). The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
487,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
488,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making them difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
489,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the small Central Projecting DN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
490,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
491,"This was mainly due to the presence of more small Central Projecting DN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
492,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are small Central Projecting DN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
493,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p which could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
494,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
495,Multi-color flip-out analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
496,"DN1pC and DN1pE each comprise two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD comprises four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD is made up of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
497,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4. 1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
498,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
499,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- neurons from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
500,"Similarly, the two DN2 neurons are part of a clade. Exceptions to this include the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
501,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 neurons cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting as it provides insights into their possible function."
502,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
503,"Nonetheless, the synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than four common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than nine synapses as strong connections."
504,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
505,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
506,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center linking the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
507,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
508,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
509,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
510,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
511,"Taken together, our analyses revealed hitherto unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing: While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
512,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
513,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
514,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
515,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 line and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
516,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
517,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
518,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
519,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells that provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
520,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons, that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
521,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
522,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
523,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
524,"Regardless, we found little direct inputs from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings that revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
525,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
526,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to >2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
527,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
528,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
529,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of >2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
530,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in about 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
531,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
532,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the ones used earlier for clock inputs."
533,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
534,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons that could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
535,"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
536,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
537,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
538,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells that influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
539,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
540,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves, and depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
541,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
542,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
543,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
544,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
545,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
546,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectations, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
547,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense-core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
548,"Therefore, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
549,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receive inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
550,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derives from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
551,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
552,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways, given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
553,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar co-expression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which co-expresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
554,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of the DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody or DH44-T2A-Gal4."
555,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
556,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
557,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
558,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
559,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
560,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
561,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
562,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
563,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
564,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cut-off of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
565,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
566,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
567,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we do not account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
568,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
569,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
570,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters, while excluding l-LNv, and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN, in fact, represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
571,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
572,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
573,"Similar neuropeptide co-expression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
574,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
575,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and, to a lesser extent, by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals but has not yet been observed in fruit flies."
576,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
577,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
578,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
579,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
580,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
581,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
582,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
583,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
584,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
585,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
586,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and may influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements the synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
587,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections which were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
588,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity which could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation, which is linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
589,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
590,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that the activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
591,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
592,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
593,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs and silenced each in the Drosophila feeding initiation circuit because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
594,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
595,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
596,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
597,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum and the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
598,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
599,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
600,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
601,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
602,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
603,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
604,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
605,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have a firing rate greater than 0 Hz. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
606,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
607,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
608,"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
609,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
610,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
611,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
612,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is zero, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
613,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
614,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
615,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
616,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
617,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
618,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of the 11 cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
619,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
620,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
621,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
622,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
623,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
624,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension, but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
625,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
626,"We found that the activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicts that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
627,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
628,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
629,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
630,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
631,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
632,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
633,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments, combined with previous experiments, confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
634,"Moreover, four of these neurons have been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
635,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
636,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
637,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that the activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
638,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
639,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced the consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavioral experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
621,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
622,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
623,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
624,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
625,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
626,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
627,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
628,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
629,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and serves as the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center that regulates systemic physiology."
630,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
631,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN. The LN comprises Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN includes anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
632,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
633,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
634,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata projects to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
635,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
636,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
637,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we have now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."

To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
673,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are small Central Projecting DN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
674,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p which could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
675,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with Clk4."
676,Multi-color flip-out analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
677,"DN1pC and DN1pE each consist of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD consists of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD comprises two morphologically distinct subtypes."
678,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
679,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
680,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
681,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
682,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting as it provides insights into their possible function."
683,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
684,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than four common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than nine synapses as strong connections."
685,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
686,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
687,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
688,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
689,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
690,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
691,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
692,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons that could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
693,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
694,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
695,"While post-synaptic signal was not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
696,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 driver and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
697,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. We deciphered light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons. Following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
698,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
699,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
700,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells that provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
701,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
702,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
703,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
704,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as through the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
705,"Regardless, we found little direct input from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings that revealed most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
706,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
707,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized and demonstrate interesting details that may also apply to other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
708,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
709,"Furthermore, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
710,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
711,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in about 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus."
712,"Using the same strategy as mentioned earlier to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, particularly the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
713,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Furthermore, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types which receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
714,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
715,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons that could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
716,"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
717,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
718,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
719,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells that influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
720,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
721,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
722,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
723,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
724,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
725,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
726,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
727,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
728,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
729,"Therefore, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
730,The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31 which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives.
731,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, the lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
732,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
733,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines would provide insights. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
734,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
735,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters, including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody or DH44-T2A-Gal4."
736,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
737,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in the DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
738,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC, which have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
739,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers, and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZNSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
740,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
741,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, the Pdf receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
742,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
743,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
744,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
745,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
746,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
747,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
748,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
749,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
750,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
751,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters, while excluding l-LNv and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN actually represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
752,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
753,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
754,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
755,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
756,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
757,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
758,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
759,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
760,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
761,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
762,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
763,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
764,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
765,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
766,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
767,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements the synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
768,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons of sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
769,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
770,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
771,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
772,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
773,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
774,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuits because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the FlyWire electron microscopy volume."
775,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the FlyWire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
776,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
777,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
778,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum or the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
779,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
780,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 motor neurons. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis motor neurons involved in feeding, including motor neurons 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, motor neurons 9 and 11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
781,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of motor neuron 9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of motor neuron 9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
782,"Although the exact correlation between motor neuron 9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased motor neuron 9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral motor neuron 9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral motor neuron 9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces motor neuron activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
783,"To confirm that our computational activation of motor neuron 9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate motor neuron 9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of motor neuron 9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
784,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
785,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of motor neuron 9, as well as motor neurons 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
786,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive motor neurons. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
787,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
788,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
789,"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
790,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
791,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
792,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
793,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
794,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
795,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
796,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
797,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
798,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
799,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
800,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these five, six do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
801,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
802,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
803,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
804,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
805,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
806,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
807,"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
808,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
809,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
810,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
811,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identified nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
812,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
813,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
814,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
815,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
816,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
817,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
818,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that the activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
819,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
820,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
821,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
822,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
823,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for the activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
824,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1, a descending member of the BN2 class, and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
825,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
826,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-C and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-C and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-C neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
827,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
828,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
829,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways, and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
830,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
831,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output, and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
832,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
833,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
834,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome, depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
835,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout—changes in spiking rates of neurons—with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
836,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers can use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
837,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
838,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
839,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger primarily affects sugar-sensing neurons and select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
840,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
841,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
842,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains, but does not dictate, a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
843,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
844,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
845,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
846,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
847,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and recently in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may derive from technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also from a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
848,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium circadian rhythms (CCRs). The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
849,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays affected by environmental light and noncell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we start by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
850,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods allowed us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
851,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
852,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
853,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results showed that the rhythms of slow and fast calcium activity changes exhibited similar daily patterns."
854,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
855,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1 and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
856,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. Moreover, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
857,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked around ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of “fast” calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
858,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
859,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
860,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
861,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
862,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen was conducted to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
863,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources of different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
864,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment-dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three of these genes, as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
865,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
866,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
867,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
868,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely altered. The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely altered when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
869,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and ITPR channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
870,"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-hour light:12-hour dark time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies. Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
871,"Fast calcium fluctuations require α1T calcium channels and ITPR. Knocking down the RNA for α1T voltage-gated calcium channels in pacemaker neurons impaired circadian rhythms in behavior but did not affect circadian rhythmicity in basal calcium levels within those neurons. Therefore, we next asked whether α1T may underlie the circadian rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations in pacemakers."
872,"To test this, we again performed imaging across a series of short-term high-frequency calcium measurements on the same flies for a 24-hour day with 1-hour intervals. By comparing control Drosophila with those with α1T knocked down in all circadian pacemaker neurons by tim-GAL4, we found that knocking down α1T did not affect the daily rhythms in the basal calcium level in any pacemaker group except for the DN1, which showed a reduction in the day–night difference of the basal calcium level. These high-frequency measures of slow basal calcium levels largely conform with those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions."
873,"However, the high-frequency recording revealed that fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the α1T knockdown flies, except for l-LNv. That specific pacemaker group instead displayed higher levels of fast calcium fluctuations. These results indicated that, at least in the majority of circadian pacemaker neurons, α1T is required for strong daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations and that the rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations can be selectively impaired."
874,"We then asked whether the fast calcium fluctuations are also affected in flies with Itpr knocked down in all pacemaker neurons. We performed the same high-frequency calcium imaging and analysis in Itpr knockdown flies as in α1T knockdown flies. The daily variation of pacemaker calcium was greatly reduced in Itpr knockdown flies, which largely recapitulated previous observations with less frequent sampling."
875,"In addition, fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the Itpr knockdown flies. These results suggested that rhythms in basal calcium levels, regulated by ITPR, may be necessary for rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations. In this study, we used in vivo 24-hour high-frequency calcium imaging and genetic screening to study the cellular biology of daily calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons of Drosophila."
876,"We found that the calcium rhythm is, in fact, a composite; it reflects daily fluctuations in both a slow component and a fast one. We interpret fast calcium fluctuations as representations of calcium dynamics that occur as neurons fire single action potentials or bursts of them. While it is not sufficient to resolve single action potentials, GCaMP6-induced fluorescence is a good index of neuronal electrical activity."
877,"For individual identified pacemakers, these two calcium rhythms share the same daily pattern, yet distinct calcium sources appear to contribute differentially to these two rhythms. An extracellular calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium channels that include the α1T subunit is critical for the fast calcium fluctuations. In contrast, calcium fluxes from the endoplasmic reticulum via the channel ITPR are required for both the slow rhythms in the basal calcium levels and the fast ones."
878,"Importantly, both channels are essential for normal circadian behavior. Thus, the molecular clocks may drive circadian rhythms in pacemaker neuron output by regulating different calcium sources to generate coordinated but distinct rhythms in calcium activities. Calcium rhythms are widespread across taxa."
879,"Calcium rhythms are required for circadian pacemaker functions in both rodents and Drosophila. Studies on mammalian circadian pacemakers in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are controversial regarding the temporal relationship between the calcium rhythms and rhythms in electrical activity, such as in spontaneous firing rate and in resting membrane potential. Recordings from SCN slice cultures showed that the phases of calcium rhythms in individual pacemakers are diverse and could be different from the populational phase of spontaneous firing rate rhythms."
880,"However, the populational spontaneous firing rate phase is composed of many diverse phases of spontaneous firing rate rhythms at the individual cell level; it is unclear whether spontaneous firing rate phases align with the phases of calcium rhythms. Imaging with both voltage sensors and calcium sensors in SCN slices led to the conclusion that resting membrane potential rhythms and calcium rhythms were in phase, yet another study concluded that resting membrane potential rhythms and calcium rhythms were in phase in the ventral SCN but that in the dorsal SCN, the calcium rhythm phase led the resting membrane potential rhythms by approximately 2 hours. Because the voltage sensor signal measured from the dorsal SCN may derive from the neural processes of ventral SCN neurons, the cellular interpretation of these results is unclear. Another source for the inconsistency might be the culture conditions; in fact, when SCN neurons were recorded in vivo by photometry, the rhythms in fast calcium activity were in phase with slow calcium rhythms."
881,"In general, comparisons of population rhythms and rhythms in single cells are not easily reconciled. Our recordings that tracked pacemaker neurons from different identified groups in vivo for 24 hours showed that at the single-cell level, slow calcium rhythms were unambiguously in phase with rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations; the latter likely reflects rhythms in spontaneous firing rate. To measure the fast calcium fluctuations, we employed a high-frequency light-sheet scanning microscope termed OCPI-2."
882,"OCPI-2 resolved limitations present in previous microscope designs that created a bottleneck in terms of the rate at which tissue volumes can be repeatedly scanned. Importantly, it does so without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Its use here was instrumental in allowing us to sample the whole-brain volume at frequencies as high as 5 Hz periodically throughout the day."
883,"As before, we were mindful that the wavelength and amount of total incident light may activate pacemaker neurons and alter molecular clocks. We used cry01 flies to avoid the direct light responses of pacemaker neurons and found that all pacemaker groups displayed slow calcium rhythms, with patterns that were comparable to those we previously reported, except for that of l-LNv. That group displayed an additional calcium peak in the early evening and another just before lights on."
884,"Because l-LNv innervates the optic lobes and receives large-scale visual inputs, we speculate that the repeated optical scanning might anomalously activate l-LNv in the evening via visual systems. In the later experiments, when we reduced the illumination duration per hour from 31.5 seconds to 2."
885,"In our study, l-LNv did not show additional evening peaks; this was true even when measured in wild-type flies for cry. Shorter durations of light exposure allow all pacemaker groups to display slow calcium rhythms with phases similar to those obtained during the slow-frequency recording sessions. Therefore, the concern to avoid technical artifacts when imaging light-sensitive pacemakers appears especially acute in the case of l-LNv."
886,"Nevertheless, by carefully tuning the illumination intensity for calcium imaging, we propose that it is possible to monitor normal slow calcium rhythms and fast calcium fluctuations from the same individual pacemaker neurons. The causal relationships between clock gene rhythms, calcium rhythms, and electrical activity rhythms in the SCN remain generally unresolved. Treating SCN slices with Tetrodotoxin diminished SFR rhythms, partially affected RMP rhythms and CCRs, and slowly impacted clock gene rhythms over several days."
887,"Dispersed SCN cells in vitro showed a TTX-resistant CCR, suggesting that CCR is driven by clock gene rhythms. Thus, the variation in CCR sensitivity to TTX treatment might be caused by the degree to which clock gene rhythms in vitro become progressively dysfunctional. In Drosophila, our findings suggested that clock gene rhythms drive two components of the CCR—both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations—via circadian regulation of the ER channel ITPR and the membrane voltage-gated calcium channel α1T."
888,"Both channels might then contribute to SFR and RMP rhythms. Similarly, in SCN pacemakers, pharmacologically blocking another ER channel, RyR, affected both CCR and SFR rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in basal calcium levels are regulated by calcium from the ER and are required for fast electric activity rhythms. In addition, SCN pacemakers also showed a circadian rhythm in fast calcium activity mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels."
889,"Pharmacologically blocking these membrane channels affected SFR rhythms and, in some cases, impacted CCR. In our studies, manipulating a membrane voltage-gated calcium channel in all or a subset of pacemakers selectively affected rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations, which likely reflected SFR rhythms, thus impairing circadian outputs; however, it did not significantly affect the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels. Manipulating the ER calcium channel IP3R in all pacemakers affected rhythms in both slow and fast calcium rhythms."
890,"Therefore, in parallel to mammalian SCN neurons, Drosophila circadian pacemakers generate calcium rhythms by regulating both ER and extracellular calcium sources. Since our results suggest little or no role for the RyR channel, the daily rhythmic regulation in fly pacemakers likely acts on a different set of ER and cytoplasmic membrane channels than those in mammalian pacemakers. We also presented RNAi evidence implicating the Itpr and Ca-alpha1T genes in pacemaker cell calcium fluxes."
891,"However, for each, only a single RNAi proved effective in reducing rhythmic power and increasing the percentage of arrhythmicity. Corroboration for our findings is provided by a prior report, which found that the same RNAi line we used decreases Itpr RNA levels. Similarly, we find corroboration in a prior report by Jeong et al., who described a specific Ca-alpha1T insertion line as a protein null mutation that exhibited a reduced percentage of rhythmicity and power in DD but without a change in circadian period or in the daily per rhythm. They concluded that Ca-alpha1T expression does not affect the central clock mechanism and suggested instead that it likely affects the output of the circadian system, specifically via a requirement for the channel to permit normal physiological activation of pacemaker neurons. That work provides independent genetic confirmation of our RNAi results, and its conclusions align precisely with our own."
892,"The RNAi knockdown experiments indicate a role for the ER calcium channel SERCA in supporting slow calcium rhythms in Drosophila pacemakers and behavioral rhythms. However, SERCA knockdown also produced high rates of lethality, and among survivors, there were strong effects on the PER molecular oscillation. We conclude that SERCA, which maintains the ER cytoplasmic calcium gradient, is essential for the normal physiology of the cells, but these additional phenotypes precluded an assessment of its precise role in circadian rhythmicity."
893,"In contrast to the situation with SERCA, our results support the hypothesis that ITPR is a crucial actuator of the molecular clock. Previous transcriptomic analysis also supports that possibility; in circadian neurons, Itpr displays rhythmic expression, while SERCA does not. Knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons generally caused stronger deficits in both behavioral rhythms and calcium rhythms than in just the PDF-positive neurons."
894,"One possibility might be that the RNAi expression level is lower when driven by pdf-GAL4 than when driven by tim-GAL4. However, knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons caused stronger deficits in the amplitude of calcium rhythms of non-PDF-positive neurons than in those of PDF-positive neurons."
895,"Hence, a difference in the vulnerability to IP3R disruption between PDF-negative and PDF-positive neurons might provide an additional or alternative explanation for why the pdf-GAL4-driven knockdown of Itpr affected neither calcium rhythms nor behavior. We also note that there are examples where a single RNAi line produces stronger behavioral effects when coupled with pdf-GAL4 than with tim-GAL4. Such findings suggest that the final result in such experiments will represent a mixture of GAL4 driver line strength and the differential contributions of the UAS:Responder gene product across different positions within an affected neural circuit."
896,"Finally, the RNAi knockdown of the plasma membrane calcium channel α1T indicated a role for voltage-gated T-type calcium channels in the final rhythmic output of the pacemakers. Consistent with a role in the presumed output pathway, impairing the rhythm of fast calcium activity strongly affected circadian behavior but did not affect the molecular clock or the slow calcium rhythms. T-type channels play a crucial role in other pacemakers, such as the Sino-Atrial node of the mammalian heart."
897,"Their conduction in the hyperpolarized state and closure at more depolarized potentials are central to their role in generating bursting dynamics with periods much longer than the membrane time constant. Given the power spectrum of the fluctuations observed, it seems possible that α1T channels play a similar role in the fast fluctuations of Drosophila circadian neurons. Remarkably, the expression of α1T also displays a circadian rhythm, with distinct phases in different groups of pacemaker neurons."
898,"Collectively, these results suggest that Itpr and α1T channel activity are critical to producing clock regulation of rhythms in both slow and fast calcium activities of key pacemaker neurons. Materials and Methods Fly Stocks. Flies were reared on standard yeast-supplemented cornmeal/agar food at room temperature."
899,"After eclosion, male flies were entrained under LD cycles at 25 °C for at least 3 days. The tim > GCaMPS6s; cry01/01 flies were entrained under LD for more than 6 days. The following fly lines were previously described: tim-GAL4, pdf-GAL4, cry-LexA, UAS-GCaMP6s, and LexAop-GCaMP6s."

902,"RNAi lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, and the Tokyo Stock Center: two lines for cac: UAS-KK101478-RNAi and UAS-JF02572-RNAi; two lines for α1T: UAS-KK100082-RNAi and UAS-JF02150-RNAi; three lines for α1D: UAS-GD1737-RNAi, UAS-JF01848-RNAi, and UAS-HMS00294-RNAi; two lines for α2δ: UAS-KK101267-RNAi and UAS-JF01825-RNAi; one line for Orai UAS-HMC03562-RNAi; three lines for dSTIM: UAS-KK102366-RNAi, UAS-GLC01785-RNAi, and UAS-JF02567-RNAi; two lines for SERCA: UAS-KK107371-RNAi and UAS-JF01948-RNAi; and three lines for RyR: UAS-KK101716-RNAi, UAS-HM05130-RNAi, and UAS-JF03381-RNAi. In Vivo Fly Preparations and Calcium Imaging. The fly surgery followed procedures previously described."
903,"Flies were first anesthetized by CO2 and immobilized by inserting the neck into a narrow cut in an aluminum foil base. A portion of the dorsoanterior cuticle on one side of the head, an antenna, and a small part of one compound eye were then removed. For slow calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom horizontal-scanning Objective Coupled Planar Illumination microscope."
904,"The scanning was done by moving the stage horizontally every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Each scan contained 20 to 40 separate frames with a step size of 5 to 10 μm. For fast calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom high-speed OCPI-2 microscope."
905,"Each scanning session involved moving the objective using a piezo motor at 1 to 5 Hz for 1 to 2 minutes. The same scans were then repeated on the same specimens every hour for 24 hours. During both slow and fast imaging modes, fresh hemolymph-like solution was continuously perfused."
906,Locomotor Activity Rhythm. The Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor system was used to monitor the locomotor activity rhythms of individual flies; 4- to 6-day-old male flies were monitored for 6 days under light-dark (LD) cycles and then for 9 days under constant dark (DD) conditions. The circadian rhythmicity and periodicity were measured by χ2 periodograms with a 95% confidence cutoff and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis.
907,"Arrhythmicity was defined by a power value less than 10, a width lower than one, and a period less than 18 hours or more than 30 hours. Immunocytochemistry. The flies were entrained for 6 days under LD and dissected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18."
908,"After dissection in ice-cold, calcium-free saline, fly brains were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 7% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PER [1:5,000; provided by M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA]."
909,Secondary antisera were Cy3-conjugated. Images were taken on the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. PER protein immunostaining intensity was measured in ImageJ-based Fiji.
910,"Imaging Data Analysis. Calcium imaging data were acquired by custom software, Imagine, and preprocessed using custom scripts in Julia 0.6 to produce nonrigid registration, alignment, and maximal projection along the z-axis."
911,The images were then visualized and analyzed in ImageJ-based Fiji by manually selecting regions of interest (ROIs) over individual cells or groups of cells and measuring the intensity of ROIs over time. Slow calcium activity was analyzed as described previously. Fast calcium activity in each scanning session was analyzed similarly.
912,"Between sequential scanning sessions, the ROIs for individual neurons were manually corrected for position drifts. For the calcium signal of each ROI in each session, the mean calcium intensity was measured. The range of calcium transients was measured by the average maximal calcium intensity at each time point and by the average minimal calcium intensity at each time point."
913,"The power spectrum was generated by fast Fourier transform. Then, the calcium signal was filtered by a high-pass filter, and the standard deviation (SD) of calcium changes was measured. Calcium activity trace analysis and statistics were performed using R 3."
914,Network theory has been applied to connectomes at multiple scales to understand brain-wide organization.
915,"Such analyses quantify the interconnectivity and robustness of a network and can identify highly connected nodes that may act as hubs. They also serve as a basis for comparison across brain regions, individuals, developmental stages, or species, enabling researchers to identify commonalities and differences in brain organization. Mesoscale connectomes have been constructed for the brains of humans and other mammals from MRI and MEG data, relying on functional activity correlations to infer connectivity at the millimeter scale."
916,"Rich-club organization has been observed in several mesoscale connectomes: in humans, other mammals, and light-level connectomes in Drosophila. Rich-club organization has been proposed to contribute to the ability of brains to efficiently integrate and disseminate information. Advancements in electron microscopy and dense volumetric reconstruction have enabled researchers to examine increasingly larger brain networks at the microscale."
917,"These methods do not make assumptions about the relationship between neuron connectivity and functional correlations; nodes and edges can be directly related to neurons and synaptic connections. For example, rich-club neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are part of well-studied motor control circuits. Patterns of neuronal connectivity that reoccur in different brain areas, known as motifs, have been proposed as ""building blocks"" of networks, and their prevalence in neural networks has been studied to identify organizational principles."
918,"Motifs such as reciprocal connections, feedforward loops, and 3-unicycles have received considerable attention in neuroscience owing to their implications for local computation and information flow. In this study, we characterize the network properties of the whole-brain, synapse-resolution connectome generated by the Flywire Consortium, the first complete wiring diagram of an adult brain, that of a female Drosophila melanogaster, and we lay the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical studies in this model system. A summary of data products can be found in Table 1."
919,"Summary of the dataset and definitions: Here we analyze the v630 snapshot of the Drosophila connectome as a directed weighted graph. Synapses were detected automatically, and for each α→β neuron pair, the total number of synapses between two neurons defines the connection weight. Consistent with the flagship connectome paper, we applied a threshold of five synapses per connection, unless otherwise noted; however, we also examined the robustness of several results to variation in the synapse threshold."
920,"This gives us a graph with 127,978 neurons and 2,613,129 connections. The connectome also contains synapse-level neurotransmitter predictions. The classifier discriminates between six neurotransmitters: the fast-acting classical neurotransmitters acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, and the monoamines dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin."
921,"In Drosophila, acetylcholine is excitatory and GABA is inhibitory. Glutamate can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within the brain of the fly, it has largely been observed to be inhibitory. The distribution of degrees reflects the amount of connectivity between neurons."
922,"A neuron’s in-degree is defined as the number of presynaptic partners, and the out-degree is defined as the number of postsynaptic partners. The average in/out-degree of an intrinsic neuron in the brain is 20.5, but in-degree and out-degree are not highly correlated."
923,"The average connection consists of 12.6 synapses, and the connection probability is 0.000161."
924,"This makes the fly brain a very sparse matrix when compared with the C. elegans nervous system or the partial wiring diagrams of larval zebrafish and mice, with or without a threshold applied. This sparsity is due in part to the size of the fly brain."
925,"The connection probability is highest among neurons with nearby arbors. Only 3% of neuron pairs have arbors within 50 μm of each other, but such pairs make 71% of all connections. However, even in this close regime, the connection probability in the fly is lower than in other wiring diagrams."
926,"Neurons form one connected component. To assess interconnectivity, we searched for strongly and weakly connected components. Despite its sparsity, the brain forms a highly connected network—93.3% of neurons are contained in a single strongly connected component (SCC), while 98.8% of neurons are contained in a single weakly connected component (WCC). These giant connected components, which contain the majority of neurons, persist when either the strongest or weakest connections are pruned and are robust to threshold choice, indicating that connectivity is robust: many paths connect neuron pairs. Within the giant SCC, the average shortest directed path length between neuron pairs is 4.42 hops, with every neuron reachable within 13 hops. In the giant WCC, the average shortest undirected path length between neuron pairs is 3.91 hops, with every neuron reachable within 11 hops."
927,"These numbers are comparable to those found in a similar analysis of the hemibrain dataset. The short path lengths show that the fly brain is relatively shallow compared with artificial networks. The similarities in size and path length distribution between the giant SCC and WCC highlight the prevalence of recurrent connections in the brain: in a mostly feedforward network, one would expect a smaller first SCC with longer path lengths."
928,"To assess whether high interconnectivity is a consequence of a relatively large number of interconnected neurons or a small number of very highly connected neurons, we constructed survival curves, observing whether large connected components persist when neurons are removed. Removing neurons from the directed network, starting with those of largest total degree, we find that the first SCC persists until a total degree of 50, at which point the network splits into two SCCs of roughly equal size. These two SCCs correspond to the left and right hemispheres and do not split into separate networks until about 60% of neurons are removed."
929,Removing neurons from the network by smallest total degree does not result in division of the first SCC. These results highlight the brain’s robust interconnectivity—it is not dependent on a small population of neurons. We observed similar behavior in the undirected network.
930,"These results remain qualitatively consistent when neurons are removed by in-degree or out-degree alone. Spectral analysis of the brain. To better understand the brain’s topology, we performed a spectral analysis of a random walk in the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution over all neurons in which 3% of neurons were visited 61.2% of the time."
931,"These top-visited neurons are classified as attractor nodes. These attractors often make connections in the gnathal ganglia, a large midline neuropil that sends and receives information from the periphery and contains many connections to the ventral nerve cord. We also performed a reverse walk within the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution in which 3% of neurons were visited 42."
932,"4% of the time. These neurons are repeller nodes and include many with synapses in the antennal lobes and medullae, brain regions that are close to the olfactory and visual periphery, respectively. The fly brain has a large rich club. Many networks exhibit the rich-club property, in which well-connected nodes are preferentially connected to other well-connected nodes."
933,"Comparing the observed network to a degree-preserving configuration random model, there exists a rich-club regime in the fly brain, with a cut-off of total degree = 37. This regime contains 40,218 neurons, approximately 30% of the neurons in the brain. The connection probability within the rich club is 0.000870, 5.4 times higher than the overall connection probability. The size of the rich club suggests that the network topology of the fly brain is fairly distributed, consistent with the connected component results."
934,"A rich-club analysis considering in-degree alone finds a rich-club regime with an in-degree threshold of 10, while no rich club is observed when considering out-degree alone. Note that as we continue to remove nodes, we enter a regime where the remaining neurons are no longer preferentially connected to each other. We further consider this very-high-degree regime in the Discussion."
935,"To examine the extent to which long-distance connections contribute to the rich-club property observed in the fly brain, we constructed an extension of the CFG model in which we constrain the random network by enforcing the measured connection probabilities between the 78 neuropils. By fixing the number of connections between and within neuropils, this neuropil connection model implicitly contains mesoscale spatial information. We find that the observed network is not more highly connected than the NPC model, indicating that interneuropil connections contribute to the rich-club effect."
936,"The fraction of neurons in the rich-club regime in the fly is substantially larger than in C. elegans, which has a rich club of 11 neurons. Note that the differences in rich-club size are sensitive to the criteria used to determine the rich-club cut-off and may also be a consequence of the different scales of these two networks."
937,"Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that while the worm rich club contains known hub neurons, such as the command neurons AVA and AVB, such highly connected hub neurons do not seem to be present in the fly brain. Although there are neurons with very high degrees, there also exist alternative paths between most neuron pairs. Recurrent motifs are over-represented. Connection reciprocity is a measure of the amount of direct feedback in the brain. Across the brain, this connection reciprocity probability is 0.138, higher than in both the Erdős–Rényi and CFG random models. The over-representation of reciprocal connections in brains is well established, and our results are consistent with previous observations both in Drosophila and in other species. The clustering coefficient, a metric that assesses the prevalence of triplet structures in the network, is 0.0477 in the fly brain, higher than in both the ER and CFG models. The high clustering coefficient demonstrates that the network is highly connected and is non-random in its structure. We present these metrics alongside those for two existing whole-animal connectomes, the hermaphrodite and male C. elegans, and two subvolume wiring diagrams, the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish and a region of L2/3 mouse visual cortex. Despite differences in the sparsity of the different brain networks, the values of reciprocity and clustering coefficient are comparable across all five datasets. The ER and CFG models do not contain any spatial information, instead assuming that any neuron pair may randomly connect."
938,"Our NPC model contains mesoscale spatial information but does not make distance comparisons for each neuron pair. We therefore constructed a neuron-neuron distance model with two different spatial zones of connection probability, informed by the distribution of connections as a function of distance. We computed the reciprocity and clustering coefficient for both the NND and NPC models and found that the metrics for the real network were higher than in both spatial null models, suggesting that the nonrandom connectivity observed in the brain is not solely a consequence of spatial or morphological constraints."
939,"Direct comparisons of networks of different sizes should be interpreted with caution. While the fly and worm datasets are complete brains, the zebrafish and mouse datasets are derived from brain subvolumes with truncated neurons. Moreover, differences in synapse detection and thresholding will impact topological metrics such as connection probability and reciprocity."
940,Varying the synapse threshold in the fly did not substantially change these metrics. Small-worldness of the fly brain: A small-world network is one in which nodes are highly clustered and path lengths are short. High small-worldness coefficients are associated with efficient communication between nodes.
941,"The small-worldness coefficient of the whole-brain fly connectome is SΔ = 141, higher than that of the C. elegans connectome and close to that of the internet, implying highly effective global communication among neurons in the brain. Neurotransmitter makeup of reciprocal connections: The average strength of edges participating in reciprocal connections is higher than the average strength of unidirectional connections."
942,"The majority of unidirectional connections are cholinergic, while the edges participating in reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic neurons and more GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory connections in the brain have more synapses on average compared with excitatory connections, which may partially explain the higher average strength of reciprocal connections. The most common reciprocal pairing is acetylcholine–GABA, and the second most common pairing is acetylcholine–glutamate."
943,"Both of these reciprocal motifs are excitatory–inhibitory, and both are overrepresented when compared to the neurotransmitter frequencies observed for reciprocal connections. By contrast, excitatory–excitatory acetylcholine–acetylcholine pairs are underrepresented, as are inhibitory–inhibitory GABA–GABA pairs. We observed reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths to be only weakly correlated, whereas acetylcholine–acetylcholine pairs were uncorrelated."
944,"Examples of reciprocal neuron pairs are shown in Fig. 2g. Reciprocal degree across the population: Of the 127,978 neurons in the brain, 77,607 participate in at least one reciprocal connection: approximately 2 in every 3 neurons."
945,"Many neurons participate in multiple reciprocal connections. We define reciprocal degree as the number of reciprocal connections made by a given neuron. Plotting the distributions of reciprocal degree by neurotransmitter, we observe that the majority of neurons with a high reciprocal degree are GABAergic, while, at lower reciprocal degrees, all three primary neurotransmitter types are well represented."
946,"For most neurons, the fraction of reciprocal connections is low—on average, 23% of incoming and 18% of outgoing connections are reciprocal. Plotting the fraction of reciprocal incoming connections against the fraction of reciprocal outgoing connections, we observed only a weak correlation, suggesting that reciprocal degree is not strongly coupled to either in-degree or out-degree. Similarly, there is no relationship between total degree and reciprocal degree."
947,"However, dividing the neuron population by neurotransmitter, we find that neurons of high total degree are mostly GABAergic, and for many of these neurons, more than half of their total connections are reciprocal. Neurotransmitter composition of three-node motifs: The high clustering coefficient of the brain implies an overrepresentation of triplet structures. We determined the frequency at which each of the 12 directed three-node motifs occurs in the brain."
948,"Feedforward motifs are underrepresented when compared to both ER and CFG models, while all others, including the highly recurrent motifs, are overrepresented. The strengths of edges participating in three-node motifs are higher than the average edge strength. Complex three-node motifs that contain reciprocal connections tend to be stronger than feedforward motifs."
949,"Examining the neurotransmitter composition of two of these motifs, feedforward loops and 3-unicycles, we found that edges participating in feedforward loops were predominantly cholinergic, and that the most common neurotransmitter composition is three cholinergic neurons, a feedforward excitatory configuration. The next most common compositions contain either one or two inhibitory edges. Feedforward loops with one inhibitory edge are probably feedforward inhibition motifs, whereas loops with two inhibitory edges are probably disinhibition motifs."
950,"By contrast, 3-unicycles contain a higher proportion of inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and the three most common 3-unicycle compositions all contain at least one inhibitory neuron. These cycles may act as indirect feedback inhibition circuits. Notably, observed neurotransmitter composition frequencies are closer to what may be expected by chance for feedforward loops than for 3-unicycles."
951,Examples of neurons that form three-node motifs are shown. A high clustering coefficient and an overrepresentation of highly connected motifs suggest that the local structure of the brain displays a high degree of non-randomness.
952,"This overrepresentation is present in most neuropils in the brain. Neurons with few inputs and many outputs may function as broadcasters of signals, while those with many inputs and few outputs may act as integrators. To examine such neurons, we divided the intrinsic rich-club neurons into three categories based on their relative in-degree and out-degree, defining broadcasters as those for which out-degree ≥ 5 × in-degree and integrators as those for which in-degree ≥ 5 × out-degree."
953,"These definitions, while arbitrary, enable us to describe neuron populations with unbalanced in-/out-degrees. Given these definitions, we find 676 broadcasters and 638 integrators. The remaining intrinsic rich-club neurons, including most highly reciprocal neurons, fall into the balanced category."
954,"In comparison to the overall population, rich-club neurons are less likely to be cholinergic and more likely to be GABAergic. Integrators are even less likely to be cholinergic and include a large fraction of dopaminergic neurons that may be engaged during learning. By contrast, broadcasters are predominantly cholinergic."
955,"Central brain neurons are substantially overrepresented in the rich club, while optic lobe intrinsic neurons are underrepresented. Many integrators are either central-brain intrinsic neurons or visual projection neurons, while few broadcasters are intrinsic to the central brain—many are visual centrifugal neurons or optic lobe intrinsic neurons. Broadcasters include a large number of Mi1 and Tm3 neurons—excitatory cells in the ME known to have key roles in the motion detection circuit."
956,"Most neurons are restricted to a single hemisphere—11% have inputs in both hemispheres and 11% have outputs in both hemispheres. Rich-club neurons are more likely to have inputs or outputs spanning both hemispheres: 18% and 17%, respectively. This is more common for integrators than for broadcasters."
957,"Some examples of broadcasters, integrators, and balanced neurons are shown in Fig. 4d. The rich club is close to sensory inputs. To assess the distance of the rich-club neurons from sensory inputs, we used a probabilistic information flow model to determine the relative distance of each neuron from a set of seed neurons."
958,"The model was run with different sets of seed neurons, each corresponding to a specific set of sensory inputs to the brain. This includes all sensory receptors projecting to the central brain as well as the population of visual projection neurons. Ranking these distances and normalizing returned the percentile rank of each neuron with respect to each modality."
959,"Neurons with a percentile rank of < 50% are closer than average to the given input, while neurons with a percentile rank of > 50% are farther. The rich-club neurons have a mean percentile rank of 44% relative to the set of all sensory inputs. Integrators have a mean percentile rank of 43%, while broadcasters have a mean percentile rank of 53%."
960,"The distribution of broadcasters is bifurcated, with one peak closer to inputs and another peak far from inputs. The second peak consists primarily of broadcasters in the optic lobe, which are far from sensory inputs to the central brain. Examining the ranks with respect to individual sensory modalities, we find that rich-club neurons are again closer than average to each modality."
961,"Examining the distance of neurons to multiple sensory modalities, we find that broadcasters and integrators, while scattered throughout these distributions, tend to be closer than average to multiple sensory inputs. Integrators and broadcasters that are low in rank relative to multiple modalities may be candidate sites for multisensory integration and information propagation. Network differences across brain regions: The Drosophila connectome has been segmented into 78 neuropils, each with different average connection strengths."
962,"To understand information flow between neuropils, we used a fractional weighting method accounting for each neuron’s projections to and from every neuropil. We computed the relative fraction of internal, external incoming, and external outgoing connection weights for each neuropil. These fractions reflect, respectively, the net number of connections within, being received, and being sent from each neuropil."
963,"We find differences in these fractions across brain regions: the ellipsoid body and fan-shaped body of the central complex have the highest fraction of internal connections, while in other regions, such as the mushroom body, the majority of connections are external. Some regions, such as the lateral horn, send more connections than they receive, while others, such as the lobula plate, receive more connections than they send. The fraction of internal connection weights is not correlated with neuropil size: while large neuropils such as the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebra have sizable fractions of internal weights, they do not rank the highest."
964,"Note that internal weights include any neurons with endings outside the brain, such as sensory, ascending, and descending neurons, accounting for the high fraction of internal weights in regions such as the ME, which receive inputs from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and the GNG, which connects with large numbers of ascending and descending neurons. Across the brain, 52% of all connection weights can be classified as internal. Comparing the neurotransmitters of the neurons contributing connection weights, we see that internal connections are more likely than external ones to be inhibitory."
965,"We also see differences in the neurotransmitter composition across regions. Reciprocal connections in neuropils: To perform motif analyses within each neuropil, we identified neuropil subnetworks that treat all connections within a neuropil as edges. Different neuropils differ in connection strength and density."
966,"Computing the reciprocity in each neuropil, we found regions with high reciprocity probabilities, including the central complex and the ALs. The relative number of reciprocal connections is high in the MB and ME. Note that, for these motif analyses, the results for small neuropils such as the cantles, bulbs, galls, accessory ME, and ocellar ganglion are less interpretable owing to the small number of neurons."
967,"In most neuropils, as in the whole brain, reciprocal connections are stronger than unidirectional connections. Exceptions include the protocerebral bridge, MB calyces, and bulbs, which have stronger unidirectional than reciprocal connections. There are differences in the relative prevalence of each neurotransmitter in reciprocal and unidirectional connections across neuropils: while, in most neuropils, reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic and more GABAergic edges, there are notable exceptions, such as in the neuropils of the central complex."
968,"In the MB, we find especially large differences in neurotransmitter composition between unidirectional and reciprocal connections. Comparing the edge strengths of reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connections within neuropil subnetworks, we observe that excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths are more strongly correlated in some neuropils than in others. These correlations do not appear to be dependent on neuropil size."
969,"Identifying NSRNs, we searched for intrinsic highly reciprocal rich-club neurons that make the majority of their connections within a single neuropil and found 1,863 neurons that meet these criteria. These neuropil-specific highly reciprocal neurons are predominantly inhibitory: 54% are GABAergic and another 10% are glutamatergic. In some neuropils, such as the AL and EB, there are many NSRNs, while in other neuropils, there exist only a handful of such neurons."
970,"Some NSRNs, like the APL neurons in the MB, CT1 neurons in the lobula, or AL local neurons, are known to provide global feedback inhibition in these regions. These neurons tend to be highly branched, with individual processes making reciprocal connections with different feedforward neurons. Some have been shown to have compartmentalized activity, raising the possibility of local computation."
971,"NSRNs that have yet to be characterized may have similar roles in other circuits—for example, it is likely that NSRNs found in the AVLP provide feedback to the auditory circuits in this region. While many reciprocal connections occur within single neuropils, 12.1% of all reciprocal pairs are formed by connections in two neuropils."
972,"Mapping these reciprocal connections, we find off-diagonal terms that represent pairs connecting across neuropils. The compartments of the MB are linked by many reciprocal connections, while the neuropils of the suboesophageal zone, including the GNG, saddle, and prow, form a connected block. Strong reciprocal connectivity also occurs across the midline, such as between the left and right ALs."
973,"Neuropils close to the midline, such as the superior medial protocerebrum, superior posterior slope, and inferior posterior slope, tend to have many cross-hemispheric reciprocal connections. There also exist reciprocal connections that span the central brain, such as those between the left and right anterior optic tubercles or the left and right lateral accessory lobes, demonstrating that recurrent motifs are not limited to local connections—they also exist at large spatial scales. Examples of such pairs are shown in Extended Data Fig."
974,"We also compared the map of reciprocal connections to the projectome map of all connections. For example, the superior lateral protocerebrum and superior intermediate protocerebrum are connected to the FB in the projectome but have no reciprocal connections."
975,"Similarly, the laminae have many internal connections but few reciprocal ones. Examining ach–GABA reciprocal connections highlights deviations from symmetry that represent a net imbalance of excitatory–inhibitory reciprocal connections. For example, between the LO and PVLP, most ach–GABA reciprocal connections share directionality: the ach connections are in the LO, and the GABA connections are in the PVLP."
976,"Three-node motifs differ across regions. We computed the prevalence of three-node motifs in each neuropil subnetwork relative to ER and CFG null models. Across most neuropils, we observed the same trend as we do across the entire brain: an under-representation of feedforward motifs and an over-representation of complex motifs. However, there are notable differences between neuropils."
977,"In the cantles, epaulettes, and gorgets, for example, the frequency of three-node motifs was closer to that expected in a CFG null model. However, in the FB and EB, complex motifs are particularly over-represented, consistent with their high reciprocity. Feedforward loops are over-represented in most neuropils, except for the FB, EB, NO, and MB compartments. This suggests a relative under-representation of both feedforward excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits in these brain regions."
978,"3-unicycles, an indirect feedback inhibition circuit, are over-represented across the entire brain but are under-represented in most neuropils. The notable exceptions, the ME and GNG, are very large neuropils with many sensory inputs. The over-representation of 3-unicycles in the ME implies the existence of localized cyclic structures in early visual circuitry."
979,"Notably, this motif is also over-represented in the zebrafish oculomotor circuit. Motifs 7–10 are under-represented in the ALs, perhaps a result of the small number of unidirectional edges in these regions. In most neuropils, we find that edges participating in under-represented motifs are weaker on average than edges participating in over-represented motifs, and that edges participating in three-node motifs are stronger than average."
980,"This is broadly consistent with the whole-brain three-node motif strength results. A notable exception is the laminae, where feedforward connections are strong despite being under-represented. Discussion: The completion of a wiring diagram of the full brain of Drosophila enabled us to characterize its network properties, laying the groundwork for connecting circuit motifs to biological function. Our analysis leverages spatial information, neuron class distinctions, cell type labels, and neurotransmitter predictions to interpret the network features we uncovered. Despite its sparsity, the fly brain is a robust and highly interconnected network, with over-represented reciprocal and recurrent motifs spanning multiple brain regions."
981,"These long-range connections may explain results from recent brain-wide neural recording experiments in flies and other species that have uncovered widespread activity related to both sensory processing and behavior. We provide searchable and filterable lists of the neurons discussed in this study, as well as a motif search and visualization tool to facilitate hypothesis generation and model development online through Codex. Limitations: The availability of neurotransmitter predictions for at least Ach, GABA, glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine greatly enhanced our ability to interpret the circuit motifs we identified in the connectome."
982,"However, although neurotransmitter predictions are 94% accurate when compared to a set of ground truth neurons, there are cases in which the predicted neurotransmitter does not align with the known transmitter. Here we manually corrected the Kenyon cells to be cholinergic. There may exist other populations that are also systematically misidentified, but which currently lack ground truth neurotransmitter information."
983,"While we assume that neurons obey Dale’s law, there are several known examples of co-transmission in Drosophila. It remains unclear how widespread neurotransmitter co-transmission is. Note also that the synaptic connectome does not provide a complete picture of information flow in the brain."
984,"We do not currently have a map of gap junction synapses in the fly or of the extent of neuropeptide signaling. Some analyses, particularly those dependent on network topology, are sensitive to our choice of synapse threshold. While connectomes in C. elegans have been proofread to the level of individual synapses, this is not feasible in larger datasets. We therefore rely on automated synapse detection algorithms with a non-negligible error rate. Not all synapses are successfully attached to neurons, and this completion rate varies across brain regions."
985,"Although some of these low-synapse-number connections may be spurious, it is likely that some weak connections persist across individuals, as has been found in C. elegans. Our companion paper on the fly optic lobe has found that a lower synapse threshold is important for correct cell type identification in those brain regions, further suggesting the importance of some low-synapse connections."
986,"Here we applied a consistent and conservative threshold of five synapses per connection between neurons, and we demonstrated that our interpretations of connected components, sparsity, reciprocity, and clustering coefficients are not dependent on this threshold. It is likely that the fly brain is more strongly interconnected than the results here indicate. Local circuit motifs are often inferred to be feedforward or feedback connections."
987,"However, it is difficult to place local circuits in the context of global directionality from sensory input to motor output. In shallow networks, the directionality of the wiring diagram is clear. However, the larger the network becomes, the more difficult it is to establish directionality."
988,"In this study, we used an information flow method to rank neurons relative to various sensory modalities. Ultimately, the directionality of information flow in particular circuits, especially those in regions of the brain far from sensory inputs or motor outputs, must be determined experimentally. Different neuropils in Drosophila are known to have different functions."
989,"Studying network topology at the brain scale enables us to highlight how these functional differences are supported by network differences. For example, the MBs are known to be a center for learning and memory in the fly brain. We find in the MB compartments the largest fraction of dopaminergic connections, the biggest differences between reciprocal and unidirectional neurotransmitter percentages, and a three-node motif distribution close to that of null models."
990,"This combination of network characteristics is unique across the neuropils of the brain. Another well-studied neuropil, the EB, is known to be involved in navigation, supporting persistent activity correlated to heading direction. We observed that the EB has one of the highest reciprocity rates, one of the highest average connection strengths, and very large over-representations of highly recurrent three-node motifs."
991,"This represents a unique combination of neuropil-scale network properties. By contrast, while the GNG has a similar three-node motif profile, it has much lower properties overall. The anatomy of the fly brain suggests two potential bottlenecks: one between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere, and one between the central brain and optic lobes. Only 12% of neurons cross hemispheres, and 6% of neurons cross between the central brain and optic lobes."
992,"Despite these bottlenecks, the brain is still robustly interconnected with short path lengths. The large rich-club regime in the fly brain may explain these short path lengths. When compared to the average neuron in the brain, rich-club neurons are more likely to contain synapses in both hemispheres and are also more likely to connect the optic lobes to the central brain."
993,"The broad spatial reach of these rich-club neurons also keeps path lengths short across these bottlenecks. In the human brain, it has been proposed that rich-club hubs in functional connectomes help keep path lengths short. In the fly brain, we see that the rich-club neuron population indeed contributes to short path lengths."
994,"Future functional experiments in the fly focusing on the rich-club population may shed light on whether this is the case at the neuron scale. We also expect that the ascending and descending neurons, which form a bottleneck between the brain and the VNC, will be part of the central nervous system rich club. Many ascending and descending neurons appear to have high degrees when examined within either the brain or the VNC."
995,"We await the completion of a complete CNS connectome to verify the rich-club membership of such neurons. Our rich-club analysis showed that we enter a rich-club regime above a total degree of 37. However, as we continue to remove neurons, we find that the population of neurons above degree ~100 is no longer preferentially connected relative to either CFG or NPC random networks."
996,"Based on the SCC and WCC survival curves, these very-high-degree neurons do not form multiple islands of connectivity. Rather, the first connected component persists until nearly all neurons are removed, and the second connected component never approaches the size of the first. The under-representation of connections between the very highest degree neurons is correlated with neurotransmitter composition—most are GABAergic."
997,"These very large GABAergic neurons are less likely than chance to form connections with each other. Comparing network properties across different species has the potential to uncover conserved and divergent properties of brain organization. Similarities in reciprocity and clustering coefficient across animals, which vary substantially in both size and connection density, hint at the possibility that some features of circuit architecture may be broadly conserved across nervous systems."
998,"However, comparisons of graph metrics across networks of different sizes, even for neuron-normalized metrics such as reciprocity and clustering coefficient, must be made with care. Moreover, as mentioned previously, differences in proofreading and thresholding will impact topological metrics, which treat all edges as equivalent. Applying the same threshold across datasets does not resolve this, as a given number of synapses may have different biological implications across species."
999,"It has also been observed, both in this work and in past studies, that different parts of the brain of the fly differ in their connectivity properties. It is likely that the same is true in larger brains, meaning that statistics derived from partial wiring diagrams may not be representative. In C. elegans, there is substantial variability in the connectomes of genetically identical individuals. Comparisons between the FlyWire and hemibrain datasets have already revealed similarities and differences between individual flies, but more datasets will be needed before we fully understand the variability between individuals in Drosophila. Fortunately, more whole-brain connectomes are on the horizon."
1000,"The network analysis of the fly brain presented should serve as a valuable baseline for comparison, both to the connectomes of other Drosophila individuals and to the connectomes of other species, to identify which network features are common and which are species- or individual-specific. A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a “parts list” of the brain and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision."
1001,"Here, we analyze the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families at least double in the number of types."
1002,A new serpentine medulla interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analyzing the distances in high-dimensional feature space and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features.
1003,"We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object, and color vision. Connectivity with “boundary types” that straddle the optic lobe and the central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity, and the reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development."
1004,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the twentieth century concern the neural basis of sensory perception. Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery of simple and complex cells in the visual cortex not only entered neuroscience textbooks, but the hypothetical neuronal wiring diagrams in their 1962 paper also inspired convolutional nets, which eventually ignited the deep-learning revolution in artificial intelligence. It may come as a surprise that directly mapping such wiring diagrams, influential as they may be, has been highly challenging or even impossible in mammalian brains."
1005,"Progress is being made by visual physiologists, and the reconstruction of a column of visual cortex from electron microscopy images is also becoming feasible. These are tiny slivers of visual systems; scaling up to the full complexity of mammalian vision is still aspirational. To imagine the future of visual neuroscience, it is helpful to extrapolate from a brain of a more modest size—that of the fly."
1006,"Especially over the past 15 years, visual neural circuits have been intensively investigated in Drosophila, with great progress in understanding the perception of motion, color, and objects, as well as the role of vision in complex behaviors like courtship. The release of a neuronal wiring diagram of a Drosophila brain poses an unprecedented opportunity. The first wiring diagram for a whole brain contains, as a corollary, the first wiring diagram for an entire visual system, as well as all the wiring connecting the visual system with the rest of the brain."
1007,"About 38,500 neurons are intrinsic to the right optic lobe of the reconstructed Drosophila brain. The full wiring diagram for these neurons is too complex to comprehend or even visualize. It is essential to reduce complexity by describing the connectivity between types of cells."
1008,"For example, the roughly 800 ommatidia in the compound eye send photoreceptor axons to roughly 800 L1 cells in the lamina, which in turn connect with around 800 Mi1 cells. That is a lot of cells and connections, but they can all be described by the simple rules that photoreceptors connect to L1, and L1 connects to Mi1. Some such rules are known, but this knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete."
1009,"Here we exhaustively enumerate all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe and find all the rules of connection between them. We effectively collapse 38,500 intrinsic neurons onto just 227 types, a reduction of more than 150 times. The wiring diagram is reduced from a 38,500 × 38,500 matrix to a 227 × 227 matrix, an even greater compression."
1010,"We additionally provide rules of connectivity between intrinsic types and 500 types of boundary neurons, which have also been annotated. In our connectomic approach, a cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar patterns of connectivity, and such cells are expected to share the same function. By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions."
1011,"This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking. Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe and are the main topic of this study. Moreover, there are boundary neurons that straddle the optic lobe and the rest of the brain."
1012,"Boundary neurons fall into several classes: visual projection neurons project from the optic lobe to the central brain, visual centrifugal neurons do the opposite, and heterolateral neurons extend from one optic lobe to the other while making few or no synapses in the central brain. Targets of boundary neurons in the central brain are generally multimodal and/or sensorimotor, mixing information coming from the eyes and other sense organs, so we regard the optic lobe proper as the fly’s visual system. The brain of a single Drosophila adult female was reconstructed by the FlyWire Consortium."
1013,"We proofread around 38,500 intrinsic neurons in the right optic lobe, as well as 3,900 VPNs, 250 VCNs, 150 heterolateral neurons, and 4,700 photoreceptor cells. In total, 77% of the synapses of intrinsic neurons are with other intrinsic neurons, and 23% are with boundary neurons. We divide optic lobe intrinsic neurons into four broad classes: columnar, local interneuron, cross-neuropil tangential, and cross-neuropil amacrine."
1014,"Cells of the columnar class have axons oriented parallel to the main axis of the visual columns. Following a previous study, the arbor of a columnar neuron is allowed to be wider than a single column; what matters is the orientation of the axon, not the aspect ratio of the arbor. Photoreceptor cells are columnar but are not intrinsic to the optic lobe, strictly speaking, because they enter from the retina."
1015,"Nevertheless, they will sometimes be included with intrinsic types in the following analyses. The optic lobe contains four main neuropils and a smaller fifth neuropil—the accessory medulla. We further distinguish between distal and proximal medulla, regarding them as two separate neuropils."
1016,"The border between them is layer 7 of the medulla, which is also known as the serpentine layer. A columnar cell spans multiple neuropils. Cells of the local interneuron class are defined as being confined to a single neuropil."
1017,We also define two classes that cross multiple neuropils but are not columnar. A cross-neuropil tangential cell has an axon that is oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the visual columns as it runs inside a neuropil. A cross-neuropil amacrine cell lacks an axon.
1018,Interneurons are typically amacrine but sometimes have an axon in the tangential orientation. Each class is divided into families. A family is defined as a set of cells that share the same neuropils.
1019,"For example, the Tm family projects from the distal medulla to the lobula, while the TmY family projects from the distal medulla to both the lobula and lobula plate. Each family is divided into cell types. All 227 intrinsic types, as well as photoreceptor types, are available for 3D interactive viewing."
1020,"Supplementary Data 1 includes a list of all intrinsic types and their properties. Supplementary Data 2 contains one ""card"" for each type, which includes its discriminative logical predicate, basic statistics, a diagram showing stratification and other single-cell anatomy, and 3D renderings of all the cells in the type. Most neurons in the optic lobe are columnar, and half of the families are columnar."
1021,"Interneurons constitute just 17% of optic lobe intrinsic neurons, but they represent the majority of cell types. A columnar family contains more cells than any other family. An interneuron family contains more types than any other family."
1022,"The columnar families are well known. The Sm interneuron family is new, and its name is inspired by its stratification in the serpentine medulla. Some of the cross-neuropil families are wholly or almost wholly new."
1023,"Over half of the cell types are new, and many of these are interneuron types. For each cell, we define an output feature vector by the number of output synapses onto neurons of cell type t, which runs from 1 to T. The output feature vector is a row of the cell-to-type connectivity matrix."
1024,"For each cell, we similarly define an input feature vector by the number of input synapses received from neurons of cell type t. This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix. The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector."
1025,"The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227. A cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar feature vectors. Cells of the same type are near each other in feature space, while cells of different types are far away."
1026,This was quantified using the weighted Jaccard distance. Our definition of feature vectors requires that some cell types should already exist. An initial set of cell types was defined by human analysts using traditional morphological criteria.
1027,"These traditional cell types were used to compute feature vectors, and hierarchical clustering was applied. In many cases, this led to further division into cell types that could not be distinguished by traditional criteria. In other cases, it led to grouping of morphological variants into a single type."
1028,"After splitting or merging types, the feature vectors were recomputed, and the process was continued iteratively. The final cell types were validated in several ways. We show that our clustering is self-consistent, in the sense that almost all cells end up in the original cluster if we attempt to reassign each cell’s feature vector to the nearest cluster."
1029,"For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership. We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of, on average, five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil."
1030,"Hierarchical clustering of cell types: We defined a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity. It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections.” The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions."
1031,"A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization. Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
1032,"By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions. This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking."
1033,"Class, family, and type: Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe and are the main topic of this study.

A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization."
1053,"Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
1054,"One aspect we have found helpful is displaying the top input and output connections of each type. In such a graph, some nodes can have more than one outgoing and/or more than one incoming connection. A few of these nodes appear as ""hubs"" with many visible connections."
1055,"For example, Mi1 is the top input to a large number of postsynaptic types. The nodes of the graph were positioned in 2D space by a layout algorithm that tends to place strongly connected types close together. It turns out that nearby nodes in the 2D graph layout tend to belong to the clusters that were extracted from the high-dimensional connectivity-based feature vectors."
1056,"We can also normalize the type-to-type connection matrix to be the fraction of synapses from cell type s to cell type t. Depending on the normalization, this could represent the fraction of input to type t or the fraction of output from type s. Input and output fractions are shown in Supplementary Data 5 and are equivalent to the cell type feature vectors defined earlier."
1057,"The heat maps of Supplementary Data 5 are important because they show a much more complete set of connections than the wiring diagrams, which are highly selective visualizations. The degree of a cell type can be defined as the number of cell types to which it is connected. Weak connections can be excluded from this definition by thresholding the type-to-type connection matrix before computing the degree."
1058,"For a threshold-independent measure, we instead calculate a ""perplexity"" for each cell type. The outgoing connection strengths are normalized as if they were a probability distribution, and out-perplexity is defined as the exponential of the entropy of this distribution. Out-perplexity reduces to out-degree in the special case that the distribution is uniform over the connected partners."
1059,"In-perplexity is defined analogously. If intrinsic cell types are ranked by the product of out- and in-perplexity, then TmY5a is the most connected hub, while various types in the lamina and distal medulla are the least hub-like. Motion-related cell types generally do not have high perplexity."
1060,"Out-perplexity tends to be greater than in-perplexity, although they are positively correlated. One might expect that ""early"" types in visual processing would have divergent connectivity, distributing photoreceptor signals to many targets, while ""late"" types would have convergent connectivity, summarizing the final results of optic lobe computations for use by the central brain. This idea can be tested by ranking types according to the ratio of out-perplexity to in-perplexity."
1061,"Indeed, the top of the list includes early types like the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, L3 and L5, along with many Dm and Pm interneuron types, while many Sm types are near the bottom of the list; they can be interpreted as ""late"" types given their extensive connectivity with VPNs. The numerous cell types are those whose axons project retinotopically from the eye to the lamina and distal medulla. The medulla is divided into columns, which are presumed to be in one-to-one correspondence with ommatidia of the compound eye."
1062,"Cell types containing more than 720 cells in our reconstruction, as well as photoreceptor types, will be called ""numerous."" The top end of this range is likely the true number of columns in this optic lobe. For each numerous type, the cells appear to be distributed one per column, and the true number of cells is expected to approximate 800."
1063,"The observed cell numbers are mostly smaller than 800; some cells are missing from columns, presumably due to under-recovery of cells by proofreading. The connections between numerous types agree well with a previous reconstruction of seven medulla columns. The 28 numerous types have long been known."
1064,"At the other extreme, 16 types contain only a single cell. Most types lie between the extremes. It is the less numerous types of which our knowledge has been incomplete, and arguably they are where much of the magic of vision happens."
1065,"As with the photoreceptors, neural activity in the numerous cell types like L1 and Mi1 mostly encodes information about the image at or near single points in visual space. But perception requires the integration of information from points that can be quite distant from each other, and this is done by the larger neurons that belong to the less numerous types. For most of the numerous types, visual responses have been observed previously and will be used to interpret the dendrogram of Fig. 2c. We will see that the numerous types that belong to a single cluster have similar functions, which enables us to ascribe a function to each cluster as a whole. In other words, we extrapolate from the functions of the numerous types to yield preliminary clues regarding the functions of the less numerous types."
1066,"These extrapolations are speculative and are merely starting points for hypothesis generation and experimental research, and the clusters are not set in stone. They were obtained by thresholding a hierarchical clustering, and adjusting this threshold will change the number of clusters. Rather than use our clusterings, some readers may prefer to directly consult the weighted Jaccard distances between types, from which the clusterings were derived."
1067,"Other cautionary notes about the clusters are given in the Methods and Discussion. These caveats notwithstanding, we next proceed to functional interpretation of the clusters in Fig. 2c."
1068,"The ON, OFF, and luminance channels in Cluster 10 and Cluster 11 both receive strong input from photoreceptors R1–6, and we propose that they be regarded as OFF and ON channels, respectively, carrying information about light decrements and light increments. Our concept is similar to the well-known ON and OFF motion pathways but differs because our ON and OFF channels are general-purpose, feeding into the object and color subsystems as well as the motion subsystem. Cluster 10 contains the OFF cells L2, L4, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4."
1069,"Cluster 11 contains the ON cells L5, Mi1, and Tm3, and also the OFF cell L1. It makes sense to assign L1 to the ON channel even though it is an OFF cell, because L1 is inhibitory/glutamatergic, so its effects on downstream partners are similar to those of an ON excitatory cell. Note that information about whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory was not used by our clustering algorithm."
1070,"Cluster 11 also contains C2 and C3, which are expected to be ON cells because their top inputs are L1 and L5. A companion paper argues that the various Dm interneuron types in Cluster 10 and Cluster 11 normalize the activities of numerous types in the OFF and ON channels. The ON and OFF motion pathways were traditionally defined by working backward from the T4 and T5 motion detectors, which respectively compute the directions of moving ON and OFF stimuli."
1071,"The ON motion pathway is directly upstream from T4 and includes Mi1, Mi4, Mi9, and Tm3. The OFF motion pathway is directly upstream from T5 and includes Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9. Figure 4 shows that these cell types have other strong targets besides T4/T5, so they do not seem to be solely or chiefly dedicated to motion."
1072,"L3 connectivity is sufficiently unique that it stands apart from all of the other cell types as a cluster containing only the single type L3. This is consistent with current thinking that L3 constitutes a separate luminance channel, distinct from ON and OFF channels. L3 is the only L type with a sustained rather than transient response, and it encodes luminance rather than contrast."
1073,"Cluster 7 includes Dm4, Dm9, Dm12, Dm20, and Mi9, which all have L3 as their strongest input. Mi9 is also the strongest output of L3 and, like L3, exhibits a sustained response. We therefore propose that cluster 7 should be lumped with L3 in a hypothetical luminance channel."
1074,"Mi9 is traditionally grouped in the ON motion pathway, but Mi9 is an input to the object and color subsystems, not only the motion subsystem. It is less obvious whether the remaining types in cluster 7 should be grouped in the luminance channel. Indeed, these types break off into separate clusters when the threshold is adjusted to refine the flat clustering."
1075,"These types might alternatively be assigned to the color subsystem, as Mi15 and Dm2 are known to receive direct input from inner photoreceptor R8. Lawf2 is a cluster of its own. By targeting cell types in cluster 11, Lawf2 provides centrifugal feedback to the ON channel."
1076,"However, the strongest output of Lawf2 is Lai, which is thought to mediate lateral inhibition in the lamina through pathways such as R1–6→Lai→R1–6 and R1–6→Lai→L3. Lawf2 may therefore modulate lateral interactions mediated by Lai. The strongest input to Lawf2 is OA-AL2b2, which could be octopaminergic or cholinergic."
1077,"If it is octopaminergic, this input could be the source of the previously reported octopaminergic gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons. Lawf2 also receives strong input from cluster 9, which is hypothesized to be an object subsystem later on. Lai and Lawf1, the two types in cluster 8, have similar targets."
1078,"Cluster 8 provides centrifugal feedback to the OFF channel and to R1–6. Alternatively, cluster 8 could be interpreted as being part of the luminance channel, as cluster 7 is a strong input and L3 a strong output. Motion The motion-detecting T4 and T5 families belong to cluster 15."
1079,"Cluster 16 contains CT1 and Tm9, which are well known to be important for motion computation. It makes sense to regard Tm9 as dedicated to the motion subsystem rather than part of a general-purpose OFF channel, as 80% of its output synapses are onto CT1 or T5. Cluster 16 also includes Li14, an interneuron type with T5a as the strongest input, and T5a through T5d as the strongest outputs."
1080,"T4/T5 neurons synapse onto VPNs that exit the optic lobe and enter the central brain. Cluster 13 and cluster 14 contain the lobula plate interneuron family, LPi1 through LPi1. Over half of these are new."
1081,"Some LPi types consist of one or two cells that cover the entire visual field. Two LPi types may stratify in the same lobula plate layers but consist of cells with different sizes. Most LPi types are amacrine, but some exhibit axo-dendritic polarization."
1082,"Some types collectively cover only a portion of the visual field. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 types, so it is clear that cluster 13 and cluster 14 are related to motion vision. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 cells with a single preferred direction."
1083,"The only exception is LPi07, which receives inputs from T4/T5 cells with preferred directions c and d. LPi types synapse onto other LPi types and onto VPNs. Cluster 13 also contains columnar neurons from three Y types and all Tlp types."
1084,"All of these are predicted to be glutamatergic and are reciprocally connected with T4/T5 of particular preferred directions. The only exception is Tlp5, which receives input only from T4a/T5a. The Y and Tlp types also connect with LPi and columnar VPN types."
1085,"TmY20 and Am1 also belong to cluster 13 and were previously identified to be motion-related. Cluster 9 includes the numerous types T2 and T3, which have been implicated in the detection of small objects. Their downstream VPN partners LC1147 and LC1848 are also activated by small objects."
1086,"On the basis of this information, we propose that cluster 9 is part of a hypothetical object subsystem. Cluster 9 includes many other types from columnar families, interneuron families, and cross-neuropil tangential and amacrine families. Downstream targets include LC, LPLC, and LT types."
1087,"Mi1 and Tm1 are the most prominent inputs to the subsystem and respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels defined above. They are top inputs to T3, explaining why T3 is ON–OFF. T2 is ON–OFF because its top inputs are L5 and Tm2, which respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels."
1088,"Note that the Tm1 input to T2 and the L5 input to T2 are second from the top, and therefore do not show up in the figure, which is restricted to the top inputs and outputs. Several types are nearby T2 and T3 in the cell types dendrogram."
1089,"In particular, T2a, Tm21, Tm25, Tm27, TmY3, and Y3 are fairly numerous and excitatory, so we regard them as candidate object detectors. Despite its name, T2a is more similar to T3 in connectivity than to T2. T2a also receives Mi1 and Tm1 input like T3 and is predicted to be ON–OFF."
1090,"The top output of T2a is LC17, which is known to be activated by small objects and also receives input from T3. Cluster 12 contains Li19 and Li25. Cluster 9 is both a strong input to cluster 12 and a strong output of cluster 12, largely due to connections between Tm21 and Cluster 12."
1091,"We therefore include cluster 12 as well as cluster 9 in the object subsystem. The inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 are important for Drosophila color vision because their responses are more narrowly tuned to the wavelength of light than those of the outer photoreceptors R1–6. R7 prefers ultraviolet light, whereas R8 prefers blue or green light."
1092,"Cluster 4 contains Dm8a, Dm8b, Dm11, and DmDRA2, which are all inner photoreceptor targets. Cluster 1 contains most of the remaining types so far implicated in color vision. As originally defined by morphology, Tm5 is a potential postsynaptic target of the inner photoreceptors because it stratifies in the distal medulla at the M7 border and also in the M3."
1093,These are the medulla layers containing the axon terminals of R7 and R8. We found that Tm5 consists of six cell types. Three of our connectomic Tm5 types correspond to canonical Tm5 types that were previously defined by morphology and Ort expression.
1094,"Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 input, while Tm5c receives R8 input. Moreover, we found three new types, Tm5d, Tm5e, and Tm5f, that receive little or no photoreceptor input, although their stratifications are similar to those of the canonical Tm5 types. The correspondences between connectomic and morphological-molecular Tm5 types were established using morphological criteria."
1095,"However, the reader should be cautioned that there is considerable variability within a type, so reliably typing individual cells based on morphology alone is difficult or impossible. Connectivity is essential for reliable discrimination. Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 and Dm8 input, as expected from previous reports."
1096,"Tm5c receives R8 input and also strong L3 input. While some synapses from Dm8 to Tm5c do exist, this connection seems to be weak. Tm20 has been implicated in color vision because it receives R8 input."
1097,"It also receives strong L3 input. Thus, Tm20 inputs are similar to Tm5c inputs, consistent with the physiological finding that these two types are more similar to each other in their chromatic responses than they are to Tm5a and Tm5b. As Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c, and Tm20 are known to be related to color vision, we propose that the rest of cluster 1 is also part of a hypothetical color subsystem."
1098,"The new Tm5 types receive few or no synapses directly from photoreceptors, but Tm5d receives indirect R7 input from Tm5b and Dm8a, Tm5e receives indirect R8 input from Tm5c, and Tm5f receives indirect R8 input from Tm20. Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic. We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective."
1099,"As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative. Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a and Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37."
1100,"The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla. Nevertheless, we decided to include them in the Tm family."
1101,"Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic. Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic."
1102,"Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10. Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs."
1103,"Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem. This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem."
1104,"Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. Tm20, Tm5d, and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic."
1105,"We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective. As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative."
1106,"Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a, Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37. The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla."
1107,"Nevertheless, we decided to lump them into the Tm family. Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic."
1108,"Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic. Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm, and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10."
1109,"Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs. Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem."
1110,"This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem. Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4 in Tlp4."
1111,"In the first stage of morphology-based classification, these errant cells were assigned to Y11. But such pseudo-Y11 cells were later reassigned to Tlp4 on the basis of connectivity. Their feature vectors match Tlp4 because their medullary projections make few synapses, and their connectivity in the lobula and lobula plate matches Tlp4."
1112,"It is worth mentioning an unusual example in which ignoring morphological variation is correct in one sense, but ultimately turns out to be misleading. Three Li11 cells are annotated in the hemibrain reconstruction, and three corresponding cells can be identified in our optic lobe. We group two of these cells into one type."
1113,"The third cell can be paired with a fourth to form a pseudo-Li11 type with a small axonal projection into the central brain. Although the axon is visually striking, it has few synapses and therefore little impact on connectivity. Thus, it might be tempting to ignore the axon as a developmental ""accident"" and merge Li11 and pseudo-Li11 into a single type."
1114,"However, it turns out that Li11 and pseudo-Li11 are distinct types, owing to their different connectivity in the lobula. For example, Li25 has strong LT61 output, while pseudo-Li11 has strong LT11 input. Pseudo-Li11 also exists in the hemibrain, although there it lacks the small projection."
1115,"The central brain projection of pseudo-Li11 exhibits variability across individuals, providing further evidence that it is a developmental accident. We introduce the new names Li25 and Li19 to replace Li11 and pseudo-Li11. A few cells were dismissed as developmental accidents. This could be done with high confidence when the cells were small and few in number."
1116,"However, we had difficulty deciding about Li29 because it was a full-field cell in the lobula, but it also extended a smaller secondary arbor into the lobula plate. Originally, we decided that this cell was a developmental accident and did not include it in our list of types. Later on, we found that this odd-looking cell is repeated in the left optic lobe and promoted it to a type."
1117,"Spatial coverage: All cell typing efforts must decide whether to split types more finely or merge types more coarsely. We resolved this lumper-splitter dilemma by using spatial coverage as a criterion. As a general rule, the cells of a cell type collectively cover all columns of the optic lobe with a density that is fairly uniform across the visual field."
1118,"This makes sense for implementing translation-invariant computations, a strategy that is commonly used in convolutional networks and other computer vision algorithms. Uniform spatial coverage is sometimes called ""tiling,"" although cell type arbors often overlap so much that the analogy to floor tiles is misleading. Spatial coverage is also a property of many cell types in the mammalian retina."
1119,"In some types consisting of just one or a few cells, we identified an unconventional jigsaw-style spatial coverage. For example, LPi14, also known as LPi1-210, is a pair of full-field cells. We refer to them as a jigsaw pair because they jointly cover the visual field in an irregular manner, as if they were cut by a jigsaw."
1120,"Jigsaw types can also be found in other interneuron families and include Pm14, Li27, and Li28. Our feature vector includes no explicit information about the spatial coordinates of a cell. Thus, if clustering feature vectors results in cell types with good spatial coverage, that is an independent validation of the clustering."
1121,"Coverage also solves the lumper-splitter dilemma. Suppose that we attempt to split one type into two candidate types based on hierarchical clustering. If both candidate types exhibit good coverage, then we accept them as valid."
1122,"If the cells of both candidate types seem randomly scattered, that means our split is invalid because it is presumably discriminating between cells based on noise. Chromatic types like Tm5 and Dm8 might seem to be an exception to this rule, but their apparently random locations may turn out to depend systematically on pale and yellow columns. The above are easy cases, but there are also edge cases."
1123,"Suppose that splitting results in two candidate types that neatly cover the dorsal field and the ventral field, respectively, without overlap. We then reject the split, preferring to lump the two candidate types into a single type that exhibits dorsoventral spatial variation in connectivity. On the other hand, if one candidate type covers the dorsal field and the other covers the full field, this is an acceptable split."
1124,"With these heuristics, some of our cell types end up with only partial coverage of the visual field. This is especially common for boundary types. Sm is the intrinsic type family containing the most types with partial coverage."
1125,"This makes sense, given that Sm cells interact closely with many boundary types arborizing in the serpentine layer. Cell types with partial coverage make sense in the later stages of vision. After the early stages of vision, computer vision also often discards translation invariance and may perform different visual computations in different regions of the visual field."
1126,"Discussion: The connectomic approach to cell typing has three strengths. First, it is not subject to the incomplete and biased sampling that can affect other methods. Second, connectivity turns out to provide a rich set of features for distinguishing between cell types."
1127,"Third, connectomic cell typing not only yields cell types, but also, importantly, tells us how they are wired to each other. Implications for visual function include clustering cell types with similar connectivity patterns and proposing tentative interpretations of the clusters in terms of visual functions. These interpretations are speculations but should be useful for generating hypotheses that suggest interesting experiments."
1128,"Our hypothetical subsystems are devoted to motion, object, and color vision, and are fed by ON, OFF, and luminance channels. The motion subsystem contains not only the T4 and T5 families but also many interneuron types. Most interneuron types belong to the LPi family, which has been proposed to mediate opponent interactions between cells that are activated by different directions of motion."
1129,"Such opponency was demonstrated between LPi09 and LPi11, also known as LPi3-4 and LPi4-357. It is likely that LPi types can also mediate spatial normalization, as described in a companion paper. Of the 51 types in the hypothetical object subsystem, T2 and T3 have been characterized by physiologists as object detectors."
1130,"Above, we hypothesized that a number of other types are object detectors, and these candidates can be tested by future experiments. The hypothetical color subsystem contains 91 types. One can only speculate about the reason for this numeric preponderance."
1131,"Some insects are known to have sophisticated color vision capabilities such as color constancy. The computations required for color constancy are quite complex, requiring the integration of image information over long ranges. This could potentially be implemented by the large number of Sm and Li interneuron types in the hypothetical color subsystem, assuming that Drosophila exhibits color constancy."
1132,"Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 1 and cluster 3 have additional functions other than color vision and should be subdivided more finely. Future experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. A companion paper predicts that the six types in cluster 2 should exhibit orientation selectivity and hypothesizes that cluster 2 is a subsystem for form vision."
1133,"Cluster 2 connects to Cluster 1, suggesting an interaction between form and color computations. Although we have divided the optic lobe into distinct subsystems, we recognize that it is simplistic to assign every cell type to just one functional subsystem. This is the result of the “hard” clustering algorithm that we have used, which always assigns a cell type to a single cluster."
1134,"In reality, a cell type could have more than one function, or a cell type might mediate interactions between more than one subsystem. The wiring diagrams show many connections between cell types in different subsystems. Assigning such a cell type to a single subsystem is inherently ambiguous."
1135,"Implications for visual development: The detailed wiring diagram for an adult visual system precisely specifies the end goal of visual system development. Single-cell transcriptomics is providing detailed information about the molecules in fly visual neurons. Comparison of transcriptomic and connectomic information is already uncovering molecules that are important for the development of the fly visual system, and this trend is bound to increase in momentum."
1136,"Such research could be aided by our low-dimensional discriminators of cell types. Early studies relied on Golgi staining to sample neurons from multiple individuals, a technique that is best suited for identifying the most numerous types. Most of our new types are not as numerous, which may be why they were missed."
1137,"Furthermore, Golgi studies may have mistaken morphological variants for types, which could explain why many of their types cannot be identified in our optic lobe. Contemporary light-microscopy anatomy leverages genetic lines but still does not evade the limitations of incomplete and biased sampling. The story of Tm5 serves as a case in point."
1138,"A breakthrough in color vision started by genetically labeling neurons that express the histamine receptor Ort. Researchers reasoned that Ort would be expressed by cells postsynaptic to the chromatic photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are histaminergic. Light-microscopy anatomy was then used to make fine distinctions between three Tm5 types labeled in the transgenic line."
1139,"The present connectomic work has revealed six Tm5 types, a finding that was only foreshadowed by previous work on the same EM dataset. The three new Tm5 types were presumably missed by previous studies because they receive little or no direct photoreceptor input and do not express Ort. Nevertheless, they are similar to the old Tm5 types in morphology and connectivity, and have been grouped in the hypothetical color subsystem."
1140,"The Tm5 example demonstrates that connectomics can find fresh patches in well-trodden ground. More importantly, connectomics can guide us to entirely new landscapes, such as the Sm types in an entirely new type family. Distinguishing cell types using connectivity features based on connectivity enabled us to discriminate between cell types that stratify in very similar neuropil layers."
1141,"Stratification constrains connectivity because neurons cannot connect with each other unless they overlap in the same layers. However, stratification does not completely determine connectivity because neurons in the same layer may or may not connect with each other. Classical neuroanatomy, whether based on Golgi or genetic staining, relied on stratification because it could be seen with a light microscope."
1142,"Now that we have electron microscopy data, we can rely on connectivity for cell typing, rather than settle for stratification as a proxy. That being said, the present study used only connectivity at the final stage of cell typing, which was seeded by the morphological types identified during the first and second stages. It was possible to demonstrate self-consistency of the final cell types using connectivity-based features only."
1143,"We expect that it should be possible to eliminate all dependence on morphological typing and base the approach on connectivity from start to finish. This challenge is left for future work. Spatial organization of connectivity According to our wiring diagrams, whether two neurons are connected depends on their cell types."
1144,"Connectivity also depends on the locations of the neurons in the retinotopic maps of the optic lobe. As a trivial example, it is impossible for cells with small arbors to be connected if they are at distant locations. Less trivial dependencies of connectivity on location also exist."
1145,"We expect them to be important for understanding vision, although they turned out to be unnecessary for classifying cell types. To facilitate spatial analyses of connectivity, the FlyWire Codex maps a number of cell types to locations in the hexagonal lattice of columns and ommatidia. In such analyses, it may be helpful to regard cell types and spatial locations as discrete and continuous latent variables."
1146,"A companion paper demonstrates how to predict visual function by characterizing how connectivity depends on both cell type and spatial location. The cell types of cluster 2 are predicted to exhibit orientation selectivity and related phenomena reminiscent of the primary visual cortex. Artificial intelligence This paper began by recounting the story of how wiring diagrams for visual cortex drawn in the 1960s inspired convolutional nets, which eventually sparked the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence."
1147,"Convolutional nets have now been applied to reconstruct the fly brain from electron microscopy images, making the current study possible. Coming full circle, the fly optic lobe turns out to be as literal an implementation of a convolutional net as one could ever expect from a biological system. The columns of the optic lobe form a hexagonal lattice, rather than the square lattice used in computer vision, but it is a highly regular lattice nonetheless, and the activities of the neurons in each cell type are analogous to a feature map in a convolutional net."
1148,"Although the connectional architecture of the optic lobe conforms closely to the definition of a convolutional net, the connections do not appear to be learned in the sense of artificial intelligence. No changes in VPN structure and function, and only subtle changes in visual behavior have been detected after rearing flies in darkness, suggesting that visual experience may have little role in Drosophila visual development. However, mechanisms based on spontaneous activity in the pupal brain might have a role."
1149,"Implications for mammalian cell types In the central brain of Drosophila, cell types usually consist of just a pair of mirror symmetric neurons, as is also the case for C. elegans. By contrast, most optic lobe cell types are represented by many neurons, a situation that is more reminiscent of mammalian brains."
1150,"Could our connectomic approach generalize to mammalian brain structures such as retina and cortex, which are laminated like the optic lobe? Single-cell transcriptomics, often hailed as the solution to classifying cortical cell types, has also been applied to the Drosophila optic lobe. One study reported 172 transcriptomic cell types, a figure that includes VPNs as well as intrinsic neurons."
1151,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
1152,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
1153,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
1154,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large size of the neuronal network and the resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture, as well as the neuronal network motifs, are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
1155,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Further, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
1156,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
1157,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
1158,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
1159,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center that regulates systemic physiology."
1160,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
1161,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN. The LN comprises Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN includes anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1162,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1163,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
1164,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
1165,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and the location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
1166,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
1167,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
1168,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
1169,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
1170,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
1171,"DN1pC and DN1pE each comprise two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD comprises four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD consists of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
1172,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4. 1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
1173,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
1174,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
1175,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
1176,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected, since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting, as it provides insights into their possible function."
1177,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
1178,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than 4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than 9 synapses as strong connections."
1179,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
1180,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
1181,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results align with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
1182,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
1183,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
1184,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
1185,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
1186,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons that could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in advancing our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing, while the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
1187,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
1188,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, mirroring the connectivity observed in the connectomes."
1189,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
1190,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle.

In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
1198,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
1199,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
1200,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes: each of LN and DN. The LN comprises Lateral Posterior Neurons, DorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN includes anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1201,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1202,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
1203,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the small Central Projecting DN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
1204,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
1205,"This was mainly due to the presence of more small Central Projecting DN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP-expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
1206,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are small Central Projecting DN3, which we now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
1207,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
1208,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
1209,Multi-color flip-out analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
1210,"DN1pC and DN1pE are each comprised of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD is comprised of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD is comprised of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
1211,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
1212,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classifications."
1213,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
1214,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
1215,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
1216,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
1217,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than 4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than 9 synapses as strong connections."
1218,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
1219,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
1220,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
1221,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
1222,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
1223,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
1224,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
1225,"Taken together, our analyses revealed hitherto unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing, while the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
1226,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
1227,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
1228,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
1229,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
1230,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons involves the successful validation of our connectivity data. We next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
1231,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
1232,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
1233,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells, which provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
1234,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including 7 aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
1235,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
1236,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
1237,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
1238,"Regardless, we found little direct input from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings, which revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
1239,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
1240,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
1241,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
1242,"Furthermore, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
1243,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
1244,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in about 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineates the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms, which remains a major focus in chronobiology."
1245,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
1246,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Furthermore, the majority of the output from DN1pA is directed to visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
1247,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
1248,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons that could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
1249,"These descending neurons include those that have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increases drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
1250,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
1251,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
1252,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells, which influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
1253,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
1254,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
1255,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
1256,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
1257,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
1258,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
1259,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
1260,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
1261,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
1262,"Hence, the type and the identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
1263,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
1264,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
1265,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
1266,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways: Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines would be involved. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
1267,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv expresses high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv expresses both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
1268,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody and DH44-T2A-Gal4."
1269,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
1270,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
1271,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
1272,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
1273,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
1274,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, PDF receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
1275,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
1276,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
1277,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
1278,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
1279,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
1280,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
1281,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we do not account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
1282,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
1283,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
1284,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters while excluding l-LNv, as well as several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN neurons represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
1285,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
1286,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
1287,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
1288,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
1289,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and, to a lesser extent, by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
1290,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
1291,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which has been shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
1292,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
1293,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
1294,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
1295,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
1296,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can occur at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses, as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity, are very different between the two types of photoreception."
1297,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock. Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
1298,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
1299,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach. The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
1300,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of more than 4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
1301,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections which were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
1302,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity which could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation associated with various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
1303,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function, as our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
1304,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
1305,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
1306,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies."
1307,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuits because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the FlyWire electron microscopy volume."
1308,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the FlyWire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides ground truth for computational studies."
1309,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
1310,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
1311,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum or the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
1312,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, activation of appetitive GRNs results in activation of proboscis motor neurons."
1313,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
1314,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
1315,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
1316,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
1317,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
1318,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
1319,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
1320,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
1321,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
1322,"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
1323,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
1324,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
1325,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
1326,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
1327,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
1328,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
1329,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the predictions of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
1330,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
1331,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
1332,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
1333,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these five, six do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
1334,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
1335,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
1336,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
1337,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
1338,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
1339,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
1340,"We found that the activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
1341,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
1342,"This prediction is consistent with previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
1343,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
1344,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
1345,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
1346,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly in proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
1347,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments, combined with previous experiments, confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
1348,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
1349,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
1350,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
1351,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
1352,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
1353,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
1354,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
1355,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
1356,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked which among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
1357,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1, a descending member of the BN2 class, and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
1358,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
1359,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-C and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-C and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-C neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
1360,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
1361,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
1362,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for the activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
1363,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
1364,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output, and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
1365,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implemented here use a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
1366,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
1367,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length rather than activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
1368,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout of changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
1369,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
1370,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
1371,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding: Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
1372,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger primarily impacts sugar-sensing neurons and select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
1373,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
1374,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
1375,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains, but does not dictate, a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
1376,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
1377,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
1378,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
1379,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated by extracellular calcium influx as well as by intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
1380,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and, more recently, in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may derive from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, and also from a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
1381,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium cycling rhythms (CCRs). The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
1382,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays influenced by environmental light and by non-cell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we address the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
1383,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, here using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies that capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods permitted us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods allow us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
1384,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
1385,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
1386,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results: The rhythms of slow and fast calcium activity changes show similar daily patterns."
1387,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
1388,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1 and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are in fact distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
1389,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
1390,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around the same ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of “fast” calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
1391,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
1392,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
1393,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
1394,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
1395,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
1396,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels."
1397,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
1398,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of the expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
1399,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
1400,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
1401,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely altered. The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely altered when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
1402,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the ER may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
1403,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
1404,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enables synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
1405,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
1406,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and the resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
1407,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
1408,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
1409,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
1410,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
1411,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
1412,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
1413,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes: each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1414,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1415,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
1416,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
1417,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
1418,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
1419,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we have now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."

1445,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
1446,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
1447,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes: each of LN and DN. The LN comprises Lateral Posterior Neurons, DorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN includes anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1448,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1449,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
1450,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
1451,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
1452,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
1453,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
1454,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
1455,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
1456,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
1457,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture, as well as the neuronal network motifs, are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
1458,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded as being comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Further, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
1459,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
1460,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
1461,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
1462,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways.

The LN comprises Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN includes anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1465,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1466,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count.

1468,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and the location of their cell soma.

1470,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we now classify into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
1471,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
1472,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
1473,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
1474,"DN1pC and DN1pE each comprise two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD comprises four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline, while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD is comprised of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
1475,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to the DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
1476,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
1477,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
1478,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
1479,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
1480,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
1481,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than 4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than 9 synapses as strong connections."
1482,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
1483,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population, where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
1484,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
1485,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
1486,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
1487,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
1488,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
1489,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing: While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
1490,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. By driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
1491,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."

1529,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
1530,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
1531,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 drivers and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
1532,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
1533,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
1534,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
1535,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells that provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
1536,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including 7 aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
1537,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
1538,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
1539,"This is not surprising since light is the most important zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
1540,"Regardless, we found little direct inputs from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings which revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
1541,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
1542,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
1543,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time – a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
1544,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
1545,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
1546,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3–4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in approximately 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
1547,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
1548,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types which receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
1549,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
1550,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons which could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
1551,"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
1552,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can significantly influence diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
1553,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
1554,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, the circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells, which influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
1555,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or neurosecretory cells in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
1556,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone neurosecretory cells based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
1557,"Collectively, the neurosecretory cells form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain neurosecretory cells in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain neurosecretory cells, in agreement with our companion studies."
1558,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain neurosecretory cells based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult subesophageal zone neurosecretory cells and some lateral neurosecretory cells can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for medial neurosecretory cells since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different medial neurosecretory cell clusters as well as the lateral neurosecretory cell cluster."
1559,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZ-NSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most lateral neurosecretory cells do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of medial neurosecretory cells comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
1560,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of medial neurosecretory cells comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 medial neurosecretory cells represents insulin-producing cells."
1561,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 lateral neurosecretory cells. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
1562,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine if these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectations, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
1563,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
1564,"Hence, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
1565,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receive inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
1566,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
1567,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
1568,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways: Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
1569,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
1570,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody or DH44-T2A-Gal4."
1571,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in the DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
1572,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
1573,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC which have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
1574,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
1575,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
1576,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
1577,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least 7 receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
1578,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
1579,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
1580,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cut-off of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
1581,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
1582,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
1583,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
1584,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
1585,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded the identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
1586,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters while excluding l-LNv, several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN in fact represents an important hub in the clock network and displays high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
1587,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
1588,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
1589,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2 are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
1590,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in the neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
1591,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
1592,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
1593,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
1594,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks: Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
1595,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
1596,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
1597,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
1598,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
1599,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock: Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
1600,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
1601,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach: The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
1602,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of more than 4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements the synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
1603,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
1604,"Furthermore, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
1605,"Moreover, it will facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
1606,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
1607,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
1608,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating the segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies."
1609,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs and silenced each one in the Drosophila feeding initiation circuit because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
1610,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits the analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
1611,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
1612,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
1613,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum or the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
1614,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, activation of appetitive GRNs results in activation of proboscis motor neurons."
1615,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
1616,"In total, we find that the computational model can simulate a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
1617,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
1618,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
1619,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
1620,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
1621,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
1622,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
1623,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
1624,"In general, silencing individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
1625,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
1626,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
1627,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
1628,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
1629,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
1630,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
1631,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
1632,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
1633,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
1634,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
1635,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
1636,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
1637,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
1638,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
1639,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing in response to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
1640,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
1641,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
1642,"We found that the activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, it was predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
1643,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating the segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
1644,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
1645,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
1646,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identified nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
1647,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
1648,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
1649,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
1650,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
1651,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
1652,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
1653,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
1654,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
1655,"Furthermore, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
1656,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
1657,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
1658,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
1659,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1; a descending member of the BN2 class; and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
1660,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
1661,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
1662,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
1663,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
1664,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
1665,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
1666,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
1667,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models: We implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
1668,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
1669,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length, rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
1670,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
1671,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, Sapkal et al. use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
1672,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
1673,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding: Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
1674,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger impinges primarily on sugar-sensing neurons and at select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
1675,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
1676,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
1677,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains, but does not dictate, a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
1678,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
1679,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
1680,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
1681,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
1682,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and recently, in vivo, measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may arise from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also due to a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
1683,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium rhythms. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
1684,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays affected by environmental light and by noncell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we address the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
1685,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, here using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods permitted us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
1686,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
1687,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present the results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
1688,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results: The Rhythms of Slow and Fast Calcium Activity Changes Show Similar Daily Patterns."
1689,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
1690,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1, and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are in fact distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
1691,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
1692,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked around the same ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of “fast” calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
1693,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
1694,"In doing so, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable to those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
1695,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
1696,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
1697,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
1698,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
1699,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three, as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
1700,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
1701,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
1702,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-h recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
1703,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely arrhythmic."
1704,"The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely arrhythmic when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
1705,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
1706,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
1707,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
1708,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
1709,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded as being comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
1710,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
1711,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
1712,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
1713,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
1714,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded as being comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
1715,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes, each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
1716,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
1717,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
1718,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
1719,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
1720,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
1721,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we have now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
1722,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
1723,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
1724,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
1725,"DN1pC and DN1pE are each comprised of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD is comprised of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD consists of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
1726,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is, in fact, morphologically similar to the DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4. 1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
1727,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
1728,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
1729,"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
1730,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected, since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting, as it provides insights into their possible function."
1731,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
1732,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than four common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than nine synapses as strong connections."
1733,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
1734,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
1735,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
1736,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
1737,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
1738,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
1739,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
1740,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons that could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in advancing our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing, while the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
1741,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
1742,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
1743,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
1744,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
1745,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
1746,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
1747,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
1748,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells, which provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
1749,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
1750,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ and ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
1751,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
1752,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
1753,"Regardless, we found little direct input from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings that revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
1754,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, as well as additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
1755,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
1756,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time – a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
1757,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
1758,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
1759,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in approximately 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
1760,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
1761,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types which receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
1762,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provide strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
1763,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons which could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
1764,"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
1765,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
1766,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
1767,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells, which influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
1768,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
1769,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves and, depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
1770,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
1771,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC, since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
1772,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
1773,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
1774,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, DILP3, and DILP5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
1775,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
1776,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense-core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
1777,"Hence, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
1778,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
1779,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
1780,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
1781,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways: Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines would be present. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
1782,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the ""DN1p CNMa & AstC"" cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
1783,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters, including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody and DH44-T2A-Gal4."
1784,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters, such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut, remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
1785,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
1786,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
1787,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
1788,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
1789,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
1790,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
1791,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
1792,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
1793,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
1794,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
1795,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
1796,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
1797,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
1798,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
1799,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters, while excluding l-LNv and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN indeed represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p play a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appear important for clock output pathways."
1800,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
1801,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN express four neuropeptides."
1802,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
1803,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
1804,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and, to a lesser extent, by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
1805,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
1806,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
1807,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
1808,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
1809,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons, which is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
1810,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
1811,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
1812,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock. Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
1813,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
1814,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach. The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
1815,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and they can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements the synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
1816,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
1817,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity, which could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation, which is linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
1818,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
1819,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
1820,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
1821,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
1822,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuit because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the FlyWire electron microscopy volume."
1823,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the FlyWire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
1824,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
1825,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
1826,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum and the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
1827,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering based on connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
1828,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
1829,"In total, we find that the computational model can represent a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
1830,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
1831,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
1832,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
1833,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation and 455 to 200 Hz."
1834,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
1835,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
1836,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
1837,"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
1838,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
1839,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
1840,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
1841,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
1842,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to differ from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
1843,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
1844,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
1845,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
1846,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
1847,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
1848,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these six, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
1849,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
1850,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
1851,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
1852,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
1853,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
1854,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
1855,"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
1856,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
1857,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
1858,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
1859,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identified nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
1860,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
1861,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
1862,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
1863,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
1864,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
1865,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
1866,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
1867,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
1868,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
1869,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
1870,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
1871,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
1872,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1; a descending member of the BN2 class; and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
1873,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
1874,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
1875,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
1876,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
1877,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
1878,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
1879,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output, and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
1880,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implemented here include a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
1881,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
1882,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another on the basis of probabilistic traversal through the connectome, depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting which neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
1883,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for the modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
1884,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
1885,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits with extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model due to the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Furthermore, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
1886,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding: Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
1887,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have previously found that hunger impinges primarily at sugar-sensing neurons and at select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery and funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
1888,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
1889,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
1890,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains but does not dictate a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
1891,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
1892,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day–night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
1893,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated cell intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
1894,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
1895,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and, more recently, in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others proposed that they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may arise from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, and from a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
1896,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium rhythm changes. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within these groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
1897,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays affected by environmental light and by non-cell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we start by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms using physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
1898,"In this study, we used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, employing a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies that capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods allowed us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods allow us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
1899,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as previous studies have demonstrated in much more restricted temporal durations."
1900,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results from experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
1901,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels on both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results: The Rhythms of Slow and Fast Calcium Activity Changes Show Similar Daily Patterns."
1902,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
1903,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1, and due to the coarse sampling in electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
1904,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
1905,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked around ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of ""fast"" calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
1906,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
1907,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
1908,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
1909,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
1910,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
1911,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
1912,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
1913,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
1914,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
1915,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
1916,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely arrhythmic."
1917,"The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely arrhythmic when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
1918,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
1919,"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-hour light:12-hour dark time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies. Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
1920,"Fast calcium fluctuations require α1T calcium channels and ITPR. Knocking down the RNA for α1T voltage-gated calcium channels in pacemaker neurons impaired circadian rhythms in behavior but did not affect circadian rhythmicity in basal calcium levels within those neurons. Therefore, we next asked whether α1T may underlie the circadian rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations in pacemakers."
1921,"To test this, we again performed imaging across a series of short-term high-frequency calcium measurements on the same flies for a 24-hour day with 1-hour intervals. By comparing control Drosophila with those with α1T knocked down in all circadian pacemaker neurons by tim-GAL4, we found that knocking down α1T did not affect the daily rhythms in the basal calcium level in any pacemaker group except for the DN1, which showed a reduction in the day-night difference of the basal calcium level. These high-frequency measures of slow basal calcium levels largely conform with those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions."
1922,"However, the high-frequency recording revealed that fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the α1T knockdown flies, except for l-LNv. That specific pacemaker group instead displayed higher levels of fast calcium fluctuations. These results indicated that, at least in the majority of circadian pacemaker neurons, α1T is required for strong daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations and that the rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations can be selectively impaired."
1923,"We then asked whether the fast calcium fluctuations are also affected in flies with Itpr knocked down in all pacemaker neurons. We performed the same high-frequency calcium imaging and analysis in Itpr knockdown flies as in α1T knockdown flies. The daily variation of pacemaker calcium was greatly reduced in Itpr knockdown flies, which largely recapitulated previous observations with less frequent sampling."
1924,"In addition, fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the Itpr knockdown flies. These results suggested that rhythms in basal calcium levels, regulated by ITPR, may be necessary for rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations. In this study, we used in vivo 24-hour high-frequency calcium imaging and genetic screening to study the cellular biology of daily calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons of Drosophila."
1925,"We found that the calcium rhythm is, in fact, a composite; it reflects daily fluctuations in both a slow component and a fast one. We interpret fast calcium fluctuations as representations of calcium dynamics that occur as neurons fire single action potentials or bursts of them. While it is not sufficient to resolve single action potentials, GCaMP6-induced fluorescence is a good index of neuronal electrical activity."
1926,"For individual identified pacemakers, these two calcium rhythms share the same daily pattern, yet distinct calcium sources appear to contribute differentially to these two rhythms. An extracellular calcium influx, through plasma membrane calcium channels that include the α1T subunit, is critical for the fast calcium fluctuations. In contrast, calcium fluxes from the ER via the channel ITPR are required for both the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels and the fast ones."
1927,"Importantly, both channels are essential for normal circadian behavior. Thus, the molecular clocks may drive circadian rhythms in pacemaker neuron output by regulating different calcium sources to generate coordinated but distinct rhythms in its calcium activities. CCRs are widespread across taxa."
1928,"Calcium rhythms are required for circadian pacemaker functions in both rodents and Drosophila. Studies on mammalian circadian pacemakers in the SCN are controversial regarding the temporal relationship between the CCR and rhythms in electrical activity, such as spontaneous firing rate and resting membrane potential. Recordings from SCN slice cultures showed that the phases of CCR in individual pacemakers are diverse and could be different from the populational phase of SFR rhythms."
1929,"However, the populational SFR phase is composed of many diverse phases of SFR rhythms at the individual cell level; it is unclear whether SFR phases align with the phases of CCR. Imaging with both voltage sensors and calcium sensors in SCN slices showed that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase, yet there were differing conclusions regarding the dorsal SCN."
1930,"One conclusion was that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase in the ventral SCN, but that in the dorsal SCN, the CCR phase led the RMP rhythms by approximately 2 hours. Because the voltage sensor signal measured from the dorsal SCN may derive from the neural processes of ventral SCN neurons, the cellular interpretation of these results is unclear. Another source for the inconsistency might be the culture conditions; in fact, when SCN neurons were recorded in vivo by photometry, the rhythms in fast calcium activity were in phase with slow calcium rhythms."
1931,"In general, comparisons of population rhythms and rhythms in single cells are not easily reconciled. Our recordings that tracked pacemaker neurons from different identified groups in vivo for 24 hours showed that at the single cell level, slow calcium rhythms were unambiguously in phase with rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations; the latter likely reflects rhythms in SFR. To measure the fast calcium fluctuations, we employed a high-frequency light-sheet scanning microscope termed OCPI-2."
1932,"OCPI-2 resolved limitations present in previous microscope designs that created a bottleneck in terms of the rate at which tissue volumes can be repeatedly scanned. Importantly, it does so without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Its use here was instrumental in allowing us to sample the whole-brain volume at frequencies as high as 5 Hz periodically throughout the day."
1933,"As before, we were mindful that the wavelength and amount of total incident light may activate pacemaker neurons and alter molecular clocks. We used cry01 flies to avoid the direct light responses of pacemaker neurons and found that all pacemaker groups displayed slow calcium rhythms, with patterns that were comparable to those we previously reported, except for that of l-LNv. That group displayed an additional calcium peak in the early evening and another just before lights on."
1934,"Because l-LNv innervates the optic lobes and receives large-scale visual inputs, we speculate that the repeated optical scanning might anomalously activate l-LNv in the evening via visual systems. In the later experiments, we reduced the illumination duration per hour from 31.5 seconds to 2."
1935,"In 4 s, l-LNv did not show the additional evening peaks; this was true even when measured in flies wild type for cry. Shorter durations of light exposure permit all pacemaker groups to display slow calcium rhythms with phases similar to those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions. Therefore, the concern to avoid technical artifacts when imaging from light-sensitive pacemakers appears especially acute in the case of l-LNv."
1936,"Nevertheless, by carefully tuning the illumination intensity for calcium imaging, we propose that it is possible to monitor normal slow calcium rhythms and fast calcium fluctuations from the same individual pacemaker neurons. The causal relationships between clock gene rhythms, calcium rhythms, and electrical activity rhythms in the SCN remain generally unresolved. Treating SCN slices with Tetrodotoxin diminished SFR rhythms, partially affected RMP rhythms and CCRs, and slowly affected clock gene rhythms over several days."
1937,"Dispersed SCN cells in vitro showed a TTX-resistant CCR, suggesting that CCR is driven by clock gene rhythms. Thus, the variation in CCR sensitivity to TTX treatment might be caused by the degree to which clock gene rhythms in vitro become progressively dysfunctional. In Drosophila, our findings suggested that clock gene rhythms drive two components of the CCR—both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations—via circadian regulation of the ER channel ITPR and the membrane voltage-gated calcium channel α1T."
1938,"Both channels might then contribute to SFR and RMP rhythms. Similarly, in SCN pacemakers, pharmacologically blocking another ER channel, RyR, affected both CCR and SFR rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in basal calcium levels are regulated by calcium from ER and are required for fast electrical activity rhythms. In addition, SCN pacemakers also showed a circadian rhythm in fast calcium activity mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels."
1939,"Pharmacologically blocking these membrane channels affected SFR rhythms and, in some cases, affected CCR. In our studies, manipulating a membrane voltage-gated calcium channel in all or a subset of pacemakers selectively affected rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations, which likely reflected SFR rhythms and thus impaired circadian outputs; however, it did not significantly affect the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels. Manipulating the ER calcium channel IP3R in all pacemakers affected rhythms in both slow and fast calcium rhythms."
1940,"Therefore, in parallel to mammalian SCN neurons, Drosophila circadian pacemakers generate calcium rhythms by regulating both ER and extracellular calcium sources. Since our results suggest little or no role for the RyR channel, the daily rhythmic regulation in fly pacemakers likely acts on a different set of ER and cytoplasmic membrane channels than those in mammalian pacemakers. We also presented RNAi evidence implicating the Itpr and Ca-alpha1T genes in pacemaker cell calcium fluxes."
1941,"However, for each, only a single RNAi proved effective in reducing rhythmic power and increasing the percentage of arrhythmicity. Corroboration for our findings is provided by a prior report, which found that the same RNAi line we used decreases Itpr RNA levels. Likewise, we find corroboration in a prior report by Jeong et al., who described a specific Ca-alpha1T insertion line as a protein null mutation that exhibited reduced percentages of rhythmicity and power in DD but without a change in circadian period or in the daily per rhythm. They concluded that Ca-alpha1T expression does not affect the central clock mechanism and surmised instead that it likely affects the output of the circadian system, specifically via a requirement for the channel to permit normal physiological activation of pacemaker neurons. That work provides independent genetic confirmation of our RNAi results, and its conclusions align precisely with our own."
1942,"The RNAi knockdown experiments indicate a role for the ER calcium channel SERCA in supporting slow calcium rhythms in Drosophila pacemakers and behavioral rhythms. However, SERCA knockdown also produced high rates of lethality and, among survivors, strong effects on the PER molecular oscillation. We conclude that SERCA, which maintains the ER cytoplasmic calcium gradient, is essential for the normal physiology of the cells, but these additional phenotypes precluded an assessment of its precise role in circadian rhythmicity."
1943,"In contrast to the situation with SERCA, our results support the hypothesis that ITPR is a crucial actuator of the molecular clock. Previous transcriptomic analyses also support that possibility; in circadian neurons, Itpr displays rhythmic expression, while SERCA does not. Knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons generally caused stronger deficits in both behavioral rhythms and calcium rhythms than in just the PDF-positive neurons."
1944,"One possibility might be that the RNAi expression level is lower when driven by pdf-GAL4 than when driven by tim-GAL4. However, knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons caused stronger deficits in the amplitude of calcium rhythms of non–PDF-positive neurons than in those of PDF-positive neurons."
1945,"Hence, a difference in the vulnerability to IP3R disruption between PDF-negative and PDF-positive neurons might provide an additional or alternative explanation for why the pdf-GAL4–driven knockdown of Itpr affected neither calcium rhythms nor behavior. We also note that the literature provides examples wherein a single RNAi line produces stronger behavioral effects when coupled with pdf-GAL4 than with tim-GAL4. Such findings suggest that the final result in such experiments will represent a mixture of GAL4 driver line strength and the differential contributions of the UAS:Responder gene product across different positions within an affected neural circuit."
1946,"Finally, the RNAi knockdown of the plasma membrane calcium channel α1T indicated a role for voltage-gated T-type calcium channels in the final rhythmic output of the pacemakers. Consistent with a role in the presumed output pathway, impairing the rhythm of fast calcium activity strongly affected circadian behavior but did not affect the molecular clock or the slow calcium rhythms. T-type channels play a crucial role in other pacemakers, such as the sinoatrial node of the mammalian heart."
1947,"Their conduction in the hyperpolarized state and closure at more depolarized potentials are central to their role in generating bursting dynamics with periods much longer than the membrane time constant. Given the power spectrum of the fluctuations we observed, it seems possible that α1T channels play a similar role in the fast fluctuations of Drosophila circadian neurons. Remarkably, the expression of α1T also displays a circadian rhythm, with distinct phases in different groups of pacemaker neurons."
1948,"Collectively, these results suggest that Itpr and α1T channel activity are critical for producing clock regulation of rhythms in both slow and fast calcium activities of key pacemaker neurons. Materials and Methods Fly Stocks. Flies were reared on standard yeast-supplemented cornmeal/agar food at room temperature."
1949,"After eclosion, male flies were entrained under LD cycles at 25 °C for at least 3 days. The tim > GCaMPS6s; cry01/01 flies were entrained under LD for more than 6 days. The following fly lines were previously described: tim-GAL4, pdf-GAL4, cry-LexA, UAS-GCaMP6s, and LexAop-GCaMP6s."
1950,"UAS-dSTIM and UAS-dOrai were gifts from G. Hasan, National Center for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, India. UAS-Itpr RNAi was a gift from Mark Wu, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD."
1951,"Stable lines UAS-dcr2; tim-GAL4; UAS-GCaMP6s and pdf-GAL4; UAS-dcr2; cry-LexA, LexAop-GCaMP6s were created for RNAi screening of calcium channels. The cry-LexA line was a gift from F. Rouyer, National Center for Scientific Research, Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France."
1952,"RNAi lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, and the Tokyo Stock Center: two lines for cac: UAS-KK101478-RNAi and UAS-JF02572-RNAi; two lines for α1T: UAS-KK100082-RNAi and UAS-JF02150-RNAi; three lines for α1D: UAS-GD1737-RNAi, UAS-JF01848-RNAi, and UAS-HMS00294-RNAi; two lines for α2δ: UAS-KK101267-RNAi and UAS-JF01825-RNAi; one line for Orai: UAS-HMC03562-RNAi; three lines for dSTIM: UAS-KK102366-RNAi, UAS-GLC01785-RNAi, and UAS-JF02567-RNAi; two lines for SERCA: UAS-KK107371-RNAi and UAS-JF01948-RNAi; and three lines for RyR: UAS-KK101716-RNAi, UAS-HM05130-RNAi, and UAS-JF03381-RNAi. In Vivo Fly Preparations and Calcium Imaging. The fly surgery followed procedures previously described."
1953,"Flies were first anesthetized by CO₂ and immobilized by inserting the neck into a narrow cut in an aluminum foil base. A portion of the dorsoanterior cuticle on one side of the head, an antenna, and a small part of one compound eye were then removed. For slow calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom horizontal-scanning objective coupled planar illumination microscope."
1954,"The scanning was performed by moving the stage horizontally every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Each scan contained 20 to 40 separate frames with a step size of 5 to 10 μm. For fast calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom high-speed OCPI-2 microscope."
1955,"Each scanning session involved moving the objective using a piezo motor at 1 to 5 Hz for 1 to 2 minutes. The same scans were then repeated on the same specimens every hour for 24 hours. During both slow and fast imaging modes, fresh haemolymph-like solution was continuously perfused."
1956,Locomotor Activity Rhythm. The Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor system was used to monitor the locomotor activity rhythms of individual flies; 4- to 6-day-old male flies were monitored for 6 days under LD cycles and then for 9 days under DD conditions. The circadian rhythmicity and periodicity were measured by χ2 periodograms with a 95% confidence cutoff and SNR analysis.
1957,"Arrhythmicity was defined by a power value less than 10, a width lower than one, and a period less than 18 hours or more than 30 hours. Immunocytochemistry. The flies were entrained for 6 days under LD and dissected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18."
1958,"After dissection in ice-cold, calcium-free saline, fly brains were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 7% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PER [1:5,000]."
1959,Secondary antisera were Cy3-conjugated. Images were taken on the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. PER protein immunostaining intensity was measured in ImageJ-based Fiji.
1960,"Imaging Data Analysis. Calcium imaging data were acquired by custom software, Imagine, and preprocessed using custom scripts in Julia 0.6 to produce nonrigid registration, alignment, and maximal projection along the z-axis."
1961,The images were then visualized and analyzed in ImageJ-based Fiji by manually selecting ROIs over individual cells or groups of cells and measuring the intensity of ROIs over time. Slow calcium activity was analyzed as described previously. Fast calcium activity in each scanning session was analyzed similarly.
1962,"Between sequential scanning sessions, the ROIs for individual neurons were manually corrected for position drifts. For the calcium signal of each ROI in each session, the mean of calcium intensity was measured. The range of calcium transients was measured by the average maximal calcium intensity at each time point and by the average minimal calcium intensity at each time point."
1963,"The power spectrum was generated by fast Fourier transform. Then, the calcium signal was filtered by a high-pass filter, and the standard deviation of calcium changes was measured. Calcium activity trace analysis and statistics were performed using R 3."
1964,"Network theory has been applied to connectomes at multiple scales to understand brain-wide organization. Such analyses quantify the interconnectivity and robustness of a network and can identify highly connected nodes that may act as hubs. They also serve as a basis for comparison across brain regions, individuals, developmental stages, or species, enabling researchers to identify commonalities and differences in brain organization. Mesoscale connectomes have been constructed for the brains of humans and other mammals from MRI and MEG data, relying on functional activity correlations to infer connectivity at the millimeter scale."
1965,"Rich-club organization has been observed in several mesoscale connectomes: in humans, other mammals, and light-level connectomes in Drosophila. Rich-club organization has been proposed to contribute to the ability of brains to efficiently integrate and disseminate information. Advancements in electron microscopy and dense volumetric reconstruction have enabled researchers to examine increasingly larger brain networks at the microscale."
1966,"These methods do not make assumptions about the relationship between neuron connectivity and functional correlations; nodes and edges can be directly related to neurons and synaptic connections. For example, rich-club neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are part of well-studied motor control circuits. Patterns of neuronal connectivity that recur in different brain areas, known as motifs, have been proposed as ""building blocks"" of networks, and their prevalence in neural networks has been studied to identify organizational principles."
1967,"Motifs such as reciprocal connections, feedforward loops, and 3-unicycles have received considerable attention in neuroscience owing to their implications for local computation and information flow. In this study, we characterize the network properties of the whole-brain, synapse-resolution connectome generated by the Flywire Consortium, the first complete wiring diagram of an adult brain, that of a female Drosophila melanogaster, and we lay the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical studies in this model system. A summary of data products can be found in Table 1."
1968,"Summary of the dataset and definitions: Here we analyze the v630 snapshot of the Drosophila connectome as a directed weighted graph. Synapses were detected automatically, and, for each α→β neuron pair, the total number of synapses between two neurons defines the connection weight. Consistent with the flagship connectome paper, we applied a threshold of five synapses per connection unless otherwise noted; however, we also examined the robustness of several results to variation in the synapse threshold."
1969,"This gives us a graph with 127,978 neurons and 2,613,129 connections. The connectome also contains synapse-level neurotransmitter predictions. The classifier discriminates between six neurotransmitters: the fast-acting classical neurotransmitters acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, and the monoamines dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin."
1970,"In Drosophila, acetylcholine is excitatory and GABA is inhibitory. Glutamate can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within the brain of the fly, it has largely been observed to be inhibitory. The distribution of degrees reflects the amount of connectivity between neurons."
1971,"A neuron’s in-degree is defined as the number of presynaptic partners, and the out-degree is defined as the number of postsynaptic partners. The average in/out-degree of an intrinsic neuron in the brain is 20.5, but in-degree and out-degree are not highly correlated."
1972,"The average connection consists of 12.6 synapses, and the connection probability is 0.000161."
1973,"This makes the fly brain a very sparse matrix when compared with the C. elegans nervous system or the partial wiring diagrams of larval zebrafish and mice, with or without a threshold applied. This sparsity is due in part to the size of the fly brain."
1974,"The connection probability is highest among neurons with nearby arbors. Only 3% of neuron pairs have arbors within 50 μm of each other, but such pairs make 71% of all connections. However, even in this close regime, the connection probability in the fly is lower than in other wiring diagrams."
1975,"Neurons form one connected component. To assess interconnectivity, we searched for strongly and weakly connected components. Despite its sparsity, the brain forms a highly connected network—93.3% of neurons are contained in a single strongly connected component (SCC), while 98.8% of neurons are contained in a single weakly connected component (WCC). These giant connected components, which contain the majority of neurons, persist when either the strongest or weakest connections are pruned and are robust to threshold choice, indicating that connectivity is robust: many paths connect neuron pairs. Within the giant SCC, the average shortest directed path length between neuron pairs is 4.42 hops, with every neuron reachable within 13 hops. In the giant WCC, the average shortest undirected path length between neuron pairs is 3.91 hops, with every neuron reachable within 11 hops."
1976,"These numbers are comparable to those found in a similar analysis of the hemibrain dataset. The short path lengths show that the fly brain is relatively shallow compared with artificial networks. The similarities in size and path length distribution between the giant SCC and WCC highlight the prevalence of recurrent connections in the brain: in a mostly feedforward network, one would expect a smaller first SCC with longer path lengths."
1977,"To assess whether high interconnectivity is a consequence of a relatively large number of interconnected neurons or a small number of very highly connected neurons, we constructed survival curves, observing whether large connected components persist when neurons are removed. Removing neurons from the directed network, starting with those of largest total degree, we find that the first SCC persists until a total degree of 50, at which point the network splits into two SCCs of roughly equal size. These two SCCs correspond to the left and right hemispheres and do not split into separate networks until about 60% of neurons are removed."
1978,Removing neurons from the network by smallest total degree does not result in division of the first SCC. These results highlight the brain’s robust interconnectivity—it is not dependent on a small population of neurons. We observed similar behavior in the undirected network.
1979,"These results remain qualitatively consistent when neurons are removed by in-degree or out-degree alone. Spectral analysis of the brain: to better understand the brain’s topology, we performed a spectral analysis of a random walk in the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution over all neurons in which 3% of neurons were visited 61.2% of the time."
1980,"These top-visited neurons are classified as attractor nodes. These attractors often make connections in the gnathal ganglia, a large midline neuropil that sends and receives information from the periphery and contains many connections to the ventral nerve cord. We also performed a reverse walk within the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution in which 3% of neurons were visited 42%."
1981,"4% of the time. These neurons are repeller nodes and include many with synapses in the antennal lobes and medullae, brain regions that are close to the olfactory and visual periphery, respectively. The fly brain has a large rich club. Many networks exhibit the rich-club property, in which well-connected nodes are preferentially connected to other well-connected nodes."
1982,"Comparing the observed network to a degree-preserving configuration random model, there exists a rich-club regime in the fly brain, with a cut-off of total degree = 37. This regime contains 40,218 neurons, approximately 30% of the neurons in the brain. The connection probability within the rich club is 0.000870, 5.4 times higher than the overall connection probability. The size of the rich club suggests that the network topology of the fly brain is fairly distributed, consistent with the connected component results."
1983,"A rich-club analysis considering in-degree alone finds a rich-club regime with an in-degree threshold of 10, while no rich club is observed when considering out-degree alone. Note that as we continue to remove nodes, we enter a regime where the remaining neurons are no longer preferentially connected to each other. We further consider this very high-degree regime in the Discussion."
1984,"To examine the extent to which long-distance connections contribute to the rich-club property observed in the fly brain, we constructed an extension of the CFG model in which we constrain the random network by enforcing the measured connection probabilities between the 78 neuropils. By fixing the number of connections between and within neuropils, this neuropil connection model implicitly contains mesoscale spatial information. We find that the observed network is not more highly connected than the NPC model, indicating that interneuropil connections contribute to the rich-club effect."
1985,"The fraction of neurons in the rich-club regime in the fly is substantially larger than in C. elegans, which has a rich club of 11 neurons. Note that the differences in rich-club size are sensitive to the criteria used to determine the rich-club cut-off and may also be a consequence of the different scales of these two networks."
1986,"Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that while the worm rich club contains known hub neurons, such as the command neurons AVA and AVB, such highly connected hub neurons do not seem to be present in the fly brain—although there are neurons with very high degrees, there are also alternative paths between most neuron pairs. Recurrent motifs are over-represented. Connection reciprocity is a measure of the amount of direct feedback in the brain. Across the brain, this connection reciprocity probability is 0.138, higher than in both the Erdős–Rényi and CFG random models. The over-representation of reciprocal connections in brains is well established, and our results are consistent with previous observations both in Drosophila and in other species. The clustering coefficient, a metric that assesses the prevalence of triplet structures in the network, is 0.0477 in the fly brain, higher than in both the ER and CFG models. The high clustering coefficient demonstrates that the network is highly connected and is non-random in its structure. We present these metrics alongside those for two existing whole-animal connectomes, the hermaphrodite and male C. elegans, and two sub-volume wiring diagrams, the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish and a region of L2/3 mouse visual cortex. Despite differences in the sparsity of the different brain networks, the values of reciprocity and clustering coefficient are comparable across all five datasets. The ER and CFG models do not contain any spatial information, instead assuming that any neuron pair may randomly connect."
1987,"Our NPC model contains mesoscale spatial information but does not make distance comparisons for each neuron pair. We therefore constructed a neuron–neuron distance model with two different spatial zones of connection probability, informed by the distribution of connections as a function of distance. We computed the reciprocity and clustering coefficient for both the NND and NPC models and found that the metrics for the real network were higher than in both spatial null models, suggesting that the nonrandom connectivity observed in the brain is not solely a consequence of spatial or morphological constraints."
1988,"Direct comparisons of networks of different sizes should be interpreted with caution. While the fly and worm datasets are complete brains, the zebrafish and mouse datasets are derived from brain subvolumes with truncated neurons. Moreover, differences in synapse detection and thresholding will impact topological metrics such as connection probability and reciprocity."
1989,Varying the synapse threshold in the fly did not substantially change these metrics. The small-worldness of the fly brain: A small-world network is one in which nodes are highly clustered and path lengths are short. High small-worldness coefficients are associated with efficient communication between nodes.
1990,"The small-worldness coefficient of the whole-brain fly connectome is SΔ = 141, higher than that of the C. elegans connectome and close to that of the internet, implying highly effective global communication among neurons in the brain. Neurotransmitter makeup of reciprocal connections: The average strength of edges participating in reciprocal connections is higher than the average strength of unidirectional connections."
1991,"The majority of unidirectional connections are cholinergic, while the edges participating in reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic neurons and more GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory connections in the brain have more synapses on average compared with excitatory connections, which may partially explain the higher average strength of reciprocal connections. The most common reciprocal pairing is ach–GABA, and the second most common pairing is ach–glutamate."
1992,"Both of these reciprocal motifs are excitatory–inhibitory, and both are over-represented when compared to the neurotransmitter frequencies observed for reciprocal connections. By contrast, excitatory–excitatory ach–ach pairs are under-represented, as are inhibitory–inhibitory GABA–GABA pairs. We observed reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths to be only weakly correlated, whereas ach–ach pairs were uncorrelated."
1993,"Examples of reciprocal neuron pairs are shown in Fig. 2g. Reciprocal degree across the population: Of the 127,978 neurons in the brain, 77,607 participate in at least one reciprocal connection: approximately 2 in every 3 neurons."
1994,"Many neurons participate in multiple reciprocal connections. We define reciprocal degree as the number of reciprocal connections made by a given neuron. Plotting the distributions of reciprocal degree by neurotransmitter, we observe that the majority of neurons with a high reciprocal degree are GABAergic, while, at lower reciprocal degrees, all three primary neurotransmitter types are well represented."
1995,"For most neurons, the fraction of reciprocal connections is low—on average 23% of incoming and 18% of outgoing connections are reciprocal. Plotting the fraction of reciprocal incoming connections against the fraction of reciprocal outgoing connections, we observed only a weak correlation, suggesting that the reciprocal degree is not strongly coupled to either in-degree or out-degree. Similarly, there is no relationship between the total degree and the reciprocal degree."
1996,"However, dividing the neuron population by neurotransmitter, we find that neurons of high total degree are mostly GABAergic and, for many of these neurons, more than half of their total connections are reciprocal. Neurotransmitter composition of three-node motifs: The high clustering coefficient of the brain implies an overrepresentation of triplet structures. We determined the frequency at which each of the 12 directed three-node motifs occurs in the brain."
1997,"Feedforward motifs are under-represented when compared to both ER and CFG models, while all others, including the highly recurrent motifs, are over-represented. The strengths of edges participating in three-node motifs are higher than the average edge strength. Complex three-node motifs that contain reciprocal connections tend to be stronger than feedforward motifs."
1998,"Examining the neurotransmitter composition of two of these motifs, feedforward loops and 3-unicycles, we found that edges that participate in feedforward loops were predominantly cholinergic, and the most common neurotransmitter composition is three cholinergic neurons, a feedforward excitatory configuration. The next most common compositions contain either one or two inhibitory edges. Feedforward loops with one inhibitory edge are probably feedforward inhibition motifs, whereas loops with two inhibitory edges are probably disinhibition motifs."
1999,"By contrast, 3-unicycles contain a higher proportion of inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and the three most common 3-unicycle compositions all contain at least one inhibitory neuron. These cycles may act as indirect feedback inhibition circuits. Notably, observed neurotransmitter composition frequencies are closer to what may be expected by chance for feedforward loops than for 3-unicycles."
2000,"Examples of neurons that form three-node motifs are shown in Fig. 3f. A high clustering coefficient and an over-representation of highly connected motifs suggest that the local structure of the brain displays a high degree of non-randomness, consistent with previous studies."
2001,"The over-representation of feedforward loops has been widely observed in other biological networks, such as in the rat cortex."
2002,"This over-representation is present in most neuropils in the brain. Neurons with few inputs and many outputs may function as broadcasters of signals, while those with many inputs and few outputs may act as integrators. To examine such neurons, we divided the intrinsic rich-club neurons into three categories based on their relative in-degree and out-degree, defining broadcasters as those for which out-degree ≥ 5 × in-degree and integrators as those for which in-degree ≥ 5 × out-degree."
2003,"These definitions, while arbitrary, enable us to describe neuron populations with unbalanced in-/out-degrees. Given these definitions, we find 676 broadcasters and 638 integrators. The remaining intrinsic rich-club neurons, including most highly reciprocal neurons, fall into the balanced category."
2004,"In comparison to the overall population, rich-club neurons are less likely to be cholinergic and more likely to be GABAergic. Integrators are even less likely to be cholinergic and include a large fraction of dopaminergic neurons that may be engaged during learning. By contrast, broadcasters are predominantly cholinergic."
2005,"Central brain neurons are substantially over-represented in the rich club, while optic lobe intrinsic neurons are under-represented. Many integrators are either central-brain-intrinsic neurons or visual projection neurons, while few broadcasters are intrinsic to the central brain—many are visual centrifugal neurons or optic lobe intrinsic neurons. Broadcasters include a large number of Mi1 and Tm3 neurons—excitatory cells in the ME known to have key roles in the motion detection circuit."
2006,"Most neurons are restricted to a single hemisphere—11% have inputs in both hemispheres and 11% have outputs in both hemispheres. Rich-club neurons are more likely to have inputs or outputs spanning both hemispheres: 18% and 17%, respectively. This is more common for integrators than for broadcasters."
2007,"Some examples of broadcasters, integrators, and balanced neurons are shown in Fig. 4d. The rich club is close to sensory inputs. To assess the distance of the rich-club neurons from sensory inputs, we used a probabilistic information flow model to determine the relative distance of each neuron from a set of seed neurons."
2008,"The model was run with different sets of seed neurons, each corresponding to a specific set of sensory inputs to the brain. This includes all sensory receptors projecting to the central brain as well as the population of visual projection neurons. Ranking these distances and normalizing returned the percentile rank of each neuron with respect to each modality."
2009,"Neurons with a percentile rank < 50% are closer than average to the given input, while neurons with a percentile rank > 50% are farther. The rich-club neurons have a mean percentile rank of 44% relative to the set of all sensory inputs. Integrators have a mean percentile rank of 43%, while broadcasters have a mean percentile rank of 53%."
2010,"The distribution of broadcasters is bifurcated, with one peak closer to inputs and another peak far from inputs. The second peak consists primarily of broadcasters in the optic lobe, which are far from sensory inputs to the central brain. Examining the ranks with respect to individual sensory modalities, we find that rich-club neurons are again closer than average to each modality."
2011,"Examining the distance of neurons to multiple sensory modalities, we find that broadcasters and integrators, while scattered throughout these distributions, tend to be closer than average to multiple sensory inputs. Integrators and broadcasters that are low in rank relative to multiple modalities may be candidate sites of multisensory integration and information propagation. Network differences across brain regions. The Drosophila connectome has been segmented into 78 neuropils, each with different average connection strengths."
2012,"To understand information flow between neuropils, we used a fractional weighting method accounting for each neuron’s projections to and from every neuropil. We computed for each neuropil the relative fraction of internal, external incoming, and external outgoing connection weights. These fractions reflect, respectively, the net number of connections within, being received, and being sent from each neuropil."
2013,"We find differences in these fractions across brain regions: the ellipsoid body and fan-shaped body of the central complex have the highest fraction of internal connections, while in other regions, such as the mushroom body, the majority of connections are external. Some regions, such as the lateral horn, send more connections than they receive, while others, such as the lobula plate, receive more connections than they send. The fraction of internal connection weights is not correlated with neuropil size: while large neuropils such as the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebra have sizable fractions of internal weights, they do not rank the highest."
2014,"Note that internal weights include any neurons with endings outside the brain, such as sensory, ascending, and descending neurons, accounting for the high fraction of internal weights in regions such as the ME, which receive inputs from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and the GNG, which connects with large numbers of ascending and descending neurons. Across the brain, 52% of all connection weights can be classified as internal. Comparing the neurotransmitters of the neurons contributing connection weights, we see that internal connections are more likely than external ones to be inhibitory."
2015,"We also see differences in the neurotransmitter composition across regions. Reciprocal connections in neuropils. To perform motif analyses within each neuropil, we identified neuropil subnetworks that treat all connections within a neuropil as edges. Different neuropils differ in connection strength and density."
2016,"Computing the reciprocity in each neuropil, we found regions with high reciprocity probabilities, including the central complex and the ALs. The relative number of reciprocal connections is high in the MB and ME. Note that, for these motif analyses, the results for small neuropils such as the cantles, bulbs, galls, accessory ME, and ocellar ganglion are less interpretable owing to the small number of neurons."
2017,"In most neuropils, as in the whole brain, reciprocal connections are stronger than unidirectional connections. Exceptions include the protocerebral bridge, MB calyces, and bulbs, which have stronger unidirectional than reciprocal connections. There are differences in the relative prevalence of each neurotransmitter in reciprocal and unidirectional connections across neuropils: while in most neuropils, reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic and more GABAergic edges, there are notable exceptions, such as in the neuropils of the central complex."
2018,"In the MB, we find especially large differences in the neurotransmitter composition between unidirectional and reciprocal connections. Comparing the edge strengths of reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connections within neuropil subnetworks, we observe that excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths are more strongly correlated in some neuropils than in others. These correlations do not appear to be dependent on neuropil size."
2019,"Identifying NSRNs: We searched for intrinsically highly reciprocal rich-club neurons that make the majority of their connections within a single neuropil and found 1,863 neurons that meet these criteria. These neuropil-specific highly reciprocal neurons are predominantly inhibitory: 54% are GABAergic, and another 10% are glutamatergic. In some neuropils, such as the AL and EB, there are many NSRNs, while in other neuropils, there exist only a handful of such neurons."
2020,"Some NSRNs, like the APL neurons in the MB, CT1 neurons in the lobula, or AL local neurons, are known to provide global feedback inhibition in these regions. These neurons tend to be highly branched, with individual processes making reciprocal connections with different feedforward neurons. Some have been shown to have compartmentalized activity, raising the possibility of local computation."
2021,"NSRNs that have yet to be characterized may have similar roles in other circuits—for example, it is likely that NSRNs found in the AVLP provide feedback to the auditory circuits in this region. Interneuropil reciprocal connections: While many reciprocal connections occur within single neuropils, 12.1% of all reciprocal pairs are formed by connections in two neuropils."
2022,"Mapping these reciprocal connections, we find off-diagonal terms that represent pairs connecting across neuropils. The compartments of the MB are linked by many reciprocal connections, while the neuropils of the suboesophageal zone, including the GNG, saddle, and prow, form a connected block. Strong reciprocal connectivity also occurs across the midline, such as between the left and right ALs."
2023,"Neuropils close to the midline, such as the superior medial protocerebrum, superior posterior slope, and inferior posterior slope, tend to have many cross-hemispheric reciprocal connections. There also exist reciprocal connections that span the central brain, such as those between the left and right anterior optic tubercles or the left and right lateral accessory lobes, demonstrating that recurrent motifs are not limited to local connections—they also exist at large spatial scales. Examples of such pairs are shown in Extended Data Fig."
2024,"We also compared the map of reciprocal connections to the projectome map of all connections. For example, the superior lateral protocerebrum and superior intermediate protocerebrum are connected to the FB in the projectome but have no reciprocal connections."
2025,"Similarly, the laminae have many internal connections but few reciprocal ones. Examining ach–GABA reciprocal connections highlights deviations from symmetry that represent a net imbalance of excitatory–inhibitory reciprocal connections. For example, between the LO and PVLP, most ach–GABA reciprocal connections share directionality: the ach connections are in the LO and the GABA connections are in the PVLP."
2026,"Three-node motifs differ across regions. We computed the prevalence of three-node motifs in each neuropil subnetwork relative to ER and CFG null models. Across most neuropils, we observed the same trend as we do across the entire brain: an under-representation of feedforward motifs and an over-representation of complex motifs. However, there are notable differences between neuropils."
2027,"In the cantles, epaulettes, and gorgets, for example, the frequency of three-node motifs was closer to that expected in a CFG null model, while in the FB and EB, complex motifs are particularly over-represented, consistent with their high reciprocity. Feedforward loops are over-represented in most neuropils, except for the FB, EB, NO, and MB compartments. This suggests a relative under-representation of both feedforward excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits in these brain regions."
2028,"3-unicycles, an indirect feedback inhibition circuit, are over-represented across the entire brain but are under-represented in most neuropils. The notable exceptions, the ME and GNG, are very large neuropils with many sensory inputs. The over-representation of 3-unicycles in the ME implies the existence of localized cyclic structures in early visual circuitry."
2029,"Notably, this motif is also over-represented in the zebrafish oculomotor circuit. Motifs 7–10 are under-represented in the ALs, perhaps as a result of the small number of unidirectional edges in these regions. In most neuropils, we find that edges participating in under-represented motifs are weaker on average than edges participating in over-represented motifs, and that edges participating in three-node motifs are stronger than average."
2030,"This is broadly consistent with the whole-brain three-node motif strength results. A notable exception is the laminae, where feedforward connections are strong despite being under-represented. The completion of a wiring diagram of the full brain of Drosophila melanogaster enabled us to characterize its network properties, laying the groundwork for connecting circuit motifs to biological function. Our analysis leverages spatial information, neuron class distinctions, cell type labels, and neurotransmitter predictions to interpret the network features we uncovered. Despite its sparsity, the fly brain is a robust and highly interconnected network, with over-represented reciprocal and recurrent motifs spanning multiple brain regions."
2031,"These long-range connections may explain results from recent brain-wide neural recording experiments in flies and other species that have uncovered widespread activity related to both sensory processing and behavior. We provide searchable and filterable lists of the neurons discussed in this study, as well as a motif search and visualization tool to facilitate hypothesis generation and model development online through Codex. The availability of neurotransmitter predictions greatly enhanced our ability to interpret the circuit motifs we identified in the connectome."
2032,"However, although neurotransmitter predictions are 94% accurate when compared to a set of ground truth neurons, there are cases in which the predicted neurotransmitter does not align with the known transmitter. Here we manually corrected the Kenyon cells to be cholinergic. There may exist other populations that are also systematically misidentified, but which currently lack ground truth neurotransmitter information."
2033,"While we assume that neurons obey Dale’s law, there are several known examples of co-transmission in Drosophila. It remains unclear how widespread neurotransmitter co-transmission is. Note also that the synaptic connectome does not provide a complete picture of information flow in the brain."
2034,"We do not currently have a map of gap junction synapses in the fly or of the extent of neuropeptide signaling. Some analyses, particularly those dependent on network topology, are sensitive to our choice of synapse threshold. While connectomes in Caenorhabditis elegans have been proofread to the level of individual synapses, this is not feasible in larger datasets. We therefore rely on automated synapse detection algorithms with a non-negligible error rate. Not all synapses are successfully attached to neurons, and this completion rate varies across brain regions."
2035,"Although some of these low-synapse-number connections may be spurious, it is likely that some weak connections persist across individuals, as has been found in C. elegans. Our companion paper on the fly optic lobe has found that a lower synapse threshold is important for correct cell type identification in those brain regions, further suggesting the importance of some low-synapse connections."
2036,"Here we applied a consistent and conservative threshold of five synapses per connection between neurons, and we demonstrated that our interpretations of connected components, sparsity, reciprocity, and clustering coefficients are not dependent on this threshold. It is likely that the fly brain is more strongly interconnected than the results here indicate. Local circuit motifs are often inferred to be feedforward or feedback connections."
2037,"However, it is difficult to place local circuits in the context of global directionality from sensory input to motor output. In shallow networks, the directionality of the wiring diagram is clear. However, the larger the network becomes, the more difficult it becomes to establish directionality."
2038,"In this study, we used an information flow method to rank neurons relative to various sensory modalities. Ultimately, the directionality of information flow in particular circuits, especially those in regions of the brain far from sensory inputs or motor outputs, must be determined experimentally. Different neuropil-specific differences in Drosophila are known to have different functions."
2039,"Studying network topology at the brain scale enables us to highlight how these functional differences are supported by network differences. For example, the MBs are known to be a center for learning and memory in the fly brain. We find in the MB compartments the largest fraction of dopaminergic connections, the biggest differences between reciprocal and unidirectional neurotransmitter percentages, and a three-node motif distribution close to that of null models."
2040,"This combination of network characteristics is unique across the neuropils of the brain. Another well-studied neuropil, the EB, is known to be involved in navigation, supporting persistent activity correlated to heading direction. We observed that the EB has one of the highest reciprocity rates, one of the highest average connection strengths, and very large over-representations of highly recurrent three-node motifs."
2041,"This represents a unique combination of neuropil-scale network properties. By contrast, while the GNG has a similar three-node motif profile, it has much lower values. The anatomy of the fly brain suggests two potential bottlenecks: one between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere and one between the central brain and optic lobes. Only 12% of neurons cross hemispheres and 6% of neurons cross between the central brain and optic lobes."
2042,"Despite these bottlenecks, the brain is still robustly interconnected with short path lengths. The large rich-club regime in the fly brain may explain these short path lengths. When compared to the average neuron in the brain, rich-club neurons are more likely to contain synapses in both hemispheres and are also more likely to connect the optic lobes to the central brain."
2043,"The broad spatial reach of these rich-club neurons also keeps path lengths short across these bottlenecks. In the human brain, it has been proposed that rich-club hubs in functional connectomes help keep path lengths short. In the fly brain, we see that the rich-club neuron population indeed contributes to short path lengths."
2044,"Future functional experiments in the fly focusing on the rich-club population may shed light on whether this is the case at the neuron scale. We also expect that the ascending and descending neurons, which form a bottleneck between the brain and the VNC, will be part of the central nervous system rich club. Many ascending and descending neurons appear to have high degrees when examined within either the brain or the VNC."
2045,"We await the completion of a complete CNS connectome to verify the rich-club membership of such neurons. Our rich-club analysis showed that we enter a rich-club regime above a total degree of 37. However, as we continue to remove neurons, we find that the population of neurons above degree ~100 is no longer preferentially connected relative to either CFG or NPC random networks."
2046,"On the basis of the SCC and WCC survival curves, these very-high-degree neurons do not form multiple islands of connectivity. Rather, the first connected component persists until nearly all neurons are removed, and the second connected component never approaches the size of the first. The under-representation of connections between the very highest degree neurons is correlated with neurotransmitter composition—most are GABAergic."
2047,"These very large GABAergic neurons are less likely than chance to form connections with each other. Comparing network properties across different species has the potential to uncover conserved and divergent properties of brain organization. Similarities in reciprocity and clustering coefficient across animals, which vary substantially in both size and connection density, hint at the possibility that some features of circuit architecture may be broadly conserved across nervous systems."
2048,"However, comparisons of graph metrics across networks of different sizes, even for neuron-normalized metrics such as reciprocity and clustering coefficient, must be made with care. Moreover, as mentioned previously, differences in proofreading and thresholding will impact topological metrics, which treat all edges as equivalent. Applying the same threshold across datasets does not resolve this, as a given number of synapses may have different biological implications across species."
2049,"It has also been observed, both in this work and in past studies, that different parts of the brain of the fly differ in their connectivity properties. It is likely that the same is true in larger brains, meaning that statistics derived from partial wiring diagrams may not be representative. In C. elegans, there is substantial variability in the connectomes of genetically identical individuals. Comparisons between the FlyWire and hemibrain datasets have already revealed similarities and differences between individual flies, but more datasets will be needed before we fully understand the variability between individuals in Drosophila. Fortunately, more whole-brain connectomes are on the horizon."
2050,"The network analysis of the fly brain presented should serve as a valuable baseline for comparison, both to the connectomes of other Drosophila individuals and to the connectomes of other species, to identify which network features are common and which are species- or individual-specific. A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ""parts list"" of the brain and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision."
2051,"Here we analyze the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families at least double in the number of types."
2052,A new serpentine medulla interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analyzing the distances in high-dimensional feature space and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features.
2053,"We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object, and color vision. Connectivity with “boundary types” that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity, and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development."
2054,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the twentieth century concern the neural basis of sensory perception. Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery of simple and complex cells in the visual cortex not only entered neuroscience textbooks, but the hypothetical neuronal wiring diagrams in their 1962 paper also inspired convolutional nets, which eventually ignited the deep-learning revolution in artificial intelligence. It may come as a surprise that directly mapping such wiring diagrams, influential as they may be, has been highly challenging or even impossible in mammalian brains."
2055,"Progress is being made by visual physiologists, and the reconstruction of a column of visual cortex from electron microscopy images is also becoming feasible. These are tiny slivers of visual systems; scaling up to the full complexity of mammalian vision is still aspirational. To imagine the future of visual neuroscience, it is helpful to extrapolate from a brain of a more modest size—that of the fly."
2056,"Especially over the past 15 years, visual neural circuits have been intensively investigated in Drosophila with great progress in understanding the perception of motion, color, and objects, as well as the role of vision in complex behaviors like courtship. The release of a neuronal wiring diagram of a Drosophila brain poses an unprecedented opportunity. The first wiring diagram for a whole brain contains as a corollary the first wiring diagram for an entire visual system, as well as all the wiring connecting the visual system with the rest of the brain."
2057,"About 38,500 neurons are intrinsic to the right optic lobe of the reconstructed Drosophila brain. The full wiring diagram for these neurons is too complex to comprehend or even visualize. It is essential to reduce complexity by describing the connectivity between types of cells."
2058,"For example, the roughly 800 ommatidia in the compound eye send photoreceptor axons to roughly 800 L1 cells in the lamina, which in turn connect with around 800 Mi1 cells. That is a lot of cells and connections, but they can all be described by the simple rules that photoreceptors connect to L1, and L1 connects to Mi1. Some such rules are known, but this knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete."
2059,"Here we exhaustively enumerate all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe and find all rules of connection between them. We effectively collapse 38,500 intrinsic neurons onto just 227 types, a reduction of more than 150×. The wiring diagram is reduced from a 38,500 × 38,500 matrix to a 227 × 227 matrix, an even greater compression."
2060,"We additionally provide rules of connectivity between intrinsic types and 500 types of boundary neurons, which have also been annotated. In our connectomic approach, a cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar patterns of connectivity, and such cells are expected to share the same function. By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions."
2061,"This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking. Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe and are the main topic of this study. Moreover, there are boundary neurons that straddle the optic lobe and the rest of the brain."
2062,"Boundary neurons fall into several classes: visual projection neurons project from the optic lobe to the central brain, visual centrifugal neurons do the opposite and heterolateral neurons extend from one optic lobe to the other while making few or no synapses in the central brain. Targets of boundary neurons in the central brain are generally multimodal and/or sensorimotor, mixing information coming from the eyes and other sense organs, so we regard the optic lobe proper as the fly’s visual system. The brain of a single Drosophila adult female was reconstructed by the FlyWire Consortium."
2063,"We proofread around 38,500 intrinsic neurons in the right optic lobe, as well as 3,900 VPNs, 250 VCNs, 150 heterolateral neurons, and 4,700 photoreceptor cells. In total, 77% of the synapses of intrinsic neurons are with other intrinsic neurons, and 23% are with boundary neurons. We divide optic lobe intrinsic neurons into four broad classes: columnar, local interneuron, cross-neuropil tangential, and cross-neuropil amacrine."
2064,"Cells of the columnar class have axons oriented parallel to the main axis of the visual columns. Following a previous study, the arbor of a columnar neuron is allowed to be wider than a single column; what matters is the orientation of the axon, not the aspect ratio of the arbor. Photoreceptor cells are columnar but are not intrinsic to the optic lobe, strictly speaking, because they enter from the retina."
2065,"Nevertheless, they will sometimes be included with intrinsic types in the following analyses. The optic lobe contains four main neuropils and a smaller fifth neuropil—the accessory medulla. We further distinguish between distal and proximal medulla, regarding them as two separate neuropils."
2066,"The border between them is layer 7 of the medulla, which is also known as the serpentine layer. A columnar cell spans multiple neuropils. Cells of the local interneuron class are defined as being confined to a single neuropil."
2067,We also define two classes that cross multiple neuropils but are not columnar. A cross-neuropil tangential cell has an axon that is oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the visual columns as it runs inside a neuropil. A cross-neuropil amacrine cell lacks an axon.
2068,"Interneurons are typically amacrine, but sometimes have an axon in the tangential orientation. Each class is divided into families. A family is defined as a set of cells that share the same neuropils."
2069,"For example, the Tm family projects from the distal medulla to the lobula, while the TmY family projects from the distal medulla to both the lobula and lobula plate. Each family is divided into cell types. All 227 intrinsic types as well as photoreceptor types are available for 3D interactive viewing."
2070,"Supplementary Data 1 includes a list of all intrinsic types and their properties. Supplementary Data 2 contains one ""card"" for each type, which includes its discriminative logical predicate, basic statistics, diagrams showing stratification and other single-cell anatomy, and 3D renderings of all the cells in the type. Most neurons in the optic lobe are columnar, and half of the families are columnar."
2071,"Interneurons constitute just 17% of optic lobe intrinsic neurons, but the majority of cell types are interneurons. A columnar family contains more cells than any other family. An interneuron family contains more types than any other family."
2072,"The columnar families are well known. The Sm interneuron family is new, and its name is inspired by its stratification in the serpentine medulla. Some of the cross-neuropil families are wholly or almost wholly new."
2073,"Over half of the cell types are new, and many of these are interneuron types. For each cell, we define an output feature vector by the number of output synapses onto neurons of cell type t, which runs from 1 to T. The output feature vector is a row of the cell-to-type connectivity matrix."
2074,"For each cell, we similarly define an input feature vector by the number of input synapses received from neurons of cell type t. This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix. The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector."
2075,"The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227. A cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar feature vectors. Cells of the same type are near each other in feature space, while cells of different types are far away."
2076,This was quantified using the weighted Jaccard distance. Our definition of feature vectors requires that some cell types should already exist. An initial set of cell types was defined by human analysts using traditional morphological criteria.
2077,"These traditional cell types were used to compute feature vectors, and hierarchical clustering was applied. In many cases, this led to further division into cell types that could not be distinguished by traditional criteria. In other cases, it led to the grouping of morphological variants into a single type."
2078,"After splitting or merging types, the feature vectors were recomputed and the process was continued iteratively. The final cell types were validated in several ways. We show that our clustering is self-consistent, in the sense that almost all cells end up in the original cluster if we attempt to reassign each cell’s feature vector to the nearest cluster."
2079,"For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership. We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of, on average, five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil."
2080,"We defined a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity. It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections.” The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions."
2081,"A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization. Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
2082,"By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions. This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking."

For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership."
2100,"We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of, on average, five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil. Hierarchical clustering of cell types defines a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity."
2101,"It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections.” The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions. A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization."
2102,"Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
2103,"One that we have found to be helpful is to display the top input and output connections of each type. In such a graph, some nodes can have more than one outgoing and/or more than one incoming connection. A few of these nodes show up as ""hubs"" with many visible connections."
2104,"For example, Mi1 is the top input to a large number of postsynaptic types. The nodes of the graph were positioned in 2D space by a graph layout algorithm that tends to place strongly connected types close together. It turns out that nearby nodes in the 2D graph layout space tend to belong to the clusters that were extracted from the high-dimensional connectivity-based feature vectors."
2105,"We can also normalize the type-to-type connection matrix to be the fraction of synapses from cell type s to cell type t. Depending on the normalization, this could be the fraction of input to type t or the fraction of output from type s. Input and output fractions are shown in Supplementary Data 5 and are equivalent to the cell type feature vectors defined earlier."
2106,"The heat maps of Supplementary Data 5 are important because they show a much more complete set of connections than the wiring diagrams, which are highly selective visualizations. The degree of a cell type can be defined as the number of cell types to which it is connected. Weak connections can be excluded from this definition by thresholding the type-to-type connection matrix before computing degree."
2107,"For a threshold-independent measure, we instead calculate a ""perplexity"" for each cell type. The outgoing connection strengths are normalized as if they were a probability distribution, and out-perplexity is defined as the exponential of the entropy of this distribution. Out-perplexity reduces to out-degree in the special case that the distribution is uniform over the connected partners."
2108,"In-perplexity is defined analogously. If intrinsic cell types are ranked by the product of out- and in-perplexity, then TmY5a is the most connected hub, and various types in the lamina and distal medulla are the least hub-like. Motion-related cell types generally do not have high perplexity."
2109,"Out-perplexity tends to be greater than in-perplexity, although they are positively correlated. One might expect that ""early"" types in visual processing would have divergent connectivity to distribute photoreceptor signals to many targets, while ""late"" types would have convergent connectivity, summarizing the final results of optic lobe computations for use by the central brain. This idea can be tested by ranking types according to the ratio of out-perplexity to in-perplexity."
2110,"Indeed, the top of the list includes early types like the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, L3 and L5, and many Dm and Pm interneuron types, while many Sm types are near the bottom of the list; they can be interpreted as ""late"" types given their extensive connectivity with VPNs. The numerous cell types Photoreceptor axons project retinotopically from the eye to the lamina and distal medulla. The medulla is divided into columns, which are presumed to be in one-to-one correspondence with ommatidia of the compound eye."
2111,"Cell types containing more than 720 cells in our reconstruction, as well as photoreceptor types, will be called ""numerous."" The top end of this range is probably the true number of columns in this optic lobe. For each numerous type, the cells appear to be distributed one per column, and the true number of cells is expected to approximate 800."
2112,"The observed cell numbers are mostly smaller than 800; some cells are missing from columns, presumably due to under-recovery of cells by proofreading. The connections between numerous types agree well with a previous reconstruction of seven medulla columns. The 28 numerous types have long been known."
2113,"At the other extreme, 16 types contain only a single cell. Most types lie between the extremes. It is the less numerous types of which our knowledge has been incomplete, and arguably they are where much of the magic of vision happens."
2114,"As with the photoreceptors, neural activity in the numerous cell types like L1 and Mi1 mostly encodes information about the image at or near single points in visual space. However, perception requires the integration of information from points that can be quite distant from each other, and this is done by the larger neurons that belong to the less numerous types. For most of the numerous types, visual responses have been observed previously, and these will be used to interpret the dendrogram of Fig. 2c. We will see that the numerous types that belong to a single cluster have similar functions, which enables us to ascribe a function to each cluster as a whole. In other words, we extrapolate from the functions of the numerous types to yield preliminary clues regarding the functions of the less numerous types."
2115,"These extrapolations are speculative and are merely starting points for hypothesis generation and experimental research, and the clusters are not set in stone. They were obtained by thresholding a hierarchical clustering, and adjusting this threshold will change the number of clusters. Rather than use our clusterings, some readers may prefer to directly consult the weighted Jaccard distances between types, from which the clusterings were derived."
2116,"Other cautionary notes about the clusters are given in the Methods and Discussion. These caveats notwithstanding, we next proceed to the functional interpretation of the clusters in Fig. 2c."
2117,"Clusters 10 and 11 both receive strong input from photoreceptors R1–6, and we propose that they be regarded as OFF and ON channels, respectively, carrying information about light decrements and light increments. Our concept is similar to the well-known ON and OFF motion pathways, but differs because our ON and OFF channels are general purpose, feeding into the object and color subsystems as well as the motion subsystem. Cluster 10 contains the OFF cells L2, L4, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4."
2118,"Cluster 11 contains the ON cells L5, Mi1, and Tm3, and also the OFF cell L1. It makes sense to assign L1 to the ON channel even though it is an OFF cell because L1 is inhibitory/glutamatergic, so its effects on downstream partners are similar to those of an ON excitatory cell. Note that information about whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory was not used by our clustering algorithm."
2119,"Cluster 11 also contains C2 and C3, which are expected to be ON cells because their top inputs are L1 and L5. A companion paper argues that the various Dm interneuron types in clusters 10 and 11 normalize the activities of numerous types in the OFF and ON channels. The ON and OFF motion pathways were traditionally defined by working backward from the T4 and T5 motion detectors, which respectively compute the directions of moving ON and OFF stimuli."
2120,"The ON motion pathway is directly upstream from T4 and includes Mi1, Mi4, Mi9, and Tm3. The OFF motion pathway is directly upstream from T5 and includes Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9. Figure 4 shows that these cell types have other strong targets besides T4/T5, so they do not seem to be solely or chiefly dedicated to motion."
2121,"L3 connectivity is sufficiently unique that it stands apart from all of the other cell types as a cluster containing only the single type L3. This is consistent with current thinking that L3 constitutes a separate luminance channel, distinct from ON and OFF channels. L3 is the only L type with a sustained rather than transient response, and it encodes luminance rather than contrast."
2122,"Cluster 7 includes Dm4, Dm9, Dm12, Dm20, and Mi9, which all have L3 as their strongest input. Mi9 is also the strongest output of L3 and, like L3, exhibits a sustained response. We therefore propose that cluster 7 should be combined with L3 in a hypothetical luminance channel."
2123,"Mi9 is traditionally grouped in the ON motion pathway, but Mi9 is an input to the object and color subsystems, not only the motion subsystem. It is less obvious whether the remaining types in cluster 7 should be grouped in the luminance channel. Indeed, these types separate into distinct clusters when the threshold is adjusted to refine the flat clustering."
2124,"These types might alternatively be assigned to the color subsystem, as Mi15 and Dm2 are known to receive direct input from inner photoreceptor R8. Lawf2 is a cluster of its own. By targeting cell types in cluster 11, Lawf2 provides centrifugal feedback to the ON channel."
2125,"However, the strongest output of Lawf2 is Lai, which is thought to mediate lateral inhibition in the lamina through pathways such as R1–6→Lai→R1–6 and R1–6→Lai→L3. Lawf2 may therefore modulate lateral interactions mediated by Lai. The strongest input to Lawf2 is OA-AL2b2, which could be octopaminergic or cholinergic."
2126,"If it is octopaminergic, this input could be the source of the previously reported octopaminergic gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons. Lawf2 also receives strong input from cluster 9, which is hypothesized to be an object subsystem later on. Lai and Lawf1, the two types in cluster 8, have similar targets."
2127,"Cluster 8 provides centrifugal feedback to the OFF channel and to R1–6. Alternatively, cluster 8 could be interpreted as being part of the luminance channel, as cluster 7 is a strong input and L3 is a strong output. Motion: The motion-detecting T4 and T5 families belong to cluster 15."
2128,"Cluster 16 contains CT1 and Tm9, which are well known to be important for motion computation. It makes sense to regard Tm9 as dedicated to the motion subsystem rather than part of a general-purpose OFF channel, as 80% of its output synapses are onto CT1 or T5. Cluster 16 also includes Li14, an interneuron type with T5a as the strongest input and T5a through T5d as the strongest outputs."
2129,"T4/T5 neurons synapse onto VPNs that exit the optic lobe and enter the central brain. Cluster 13 and cluster 14 contain the lobula plate interneuron family, LPi1 through LPi15. Over half of these are new."
2130,"Some LPi types consist of one or two cells that cover the entire visual field. Two LPi types may stratify in the same lobula plate layers but consist of cells with different sizes. Most LPi types are amacrine, but some exhibit axo-dendritic polarization."
2131,"Some types collectively cover only a portion of the visual field. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 types, so it is clear that cluster 13 and cluster 14 are related to motion vision. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 cells with a single preferred direction."
2132,"The only exception is LPi07, which receives inputs from T4/T5 cells with preferred directions c and d. LPi types synapse onto other LPi types and onto VPNs. Cluster 13 also contains columnar neurons from three Y types and all Tlp types."
2133,"All of these are predicted to be glutamatergic and are reciprocally connected with T4/T5 of particular preferred directions. The only exception is Tlp5, which receives input only from T4a/T5a. The Y and Tlp types also connect with LPi and columnar VPN types."
2134,"TmY20 and Am1 also belong to cluster 13 and were previously identified to be motion related. Cluster 9 includes the numerous types T2 and T3, which have been implicated in the detection of small objects. Their downstream VPN partners LC1147 and LC1848 are also activated by small objects."
2135,"On the basis of this information, we propose that cluster 9 is part of a hypothetical object subsystem. Cluster 9 includes many other types from columnar families, interneuron families, and cross-neuropil tangential and amacrine families. Downstream targets include LC, LPLC, and LT types."
2136,"Mi1 and Tm1 are the most prominent inputs to the subsystem and respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels defined above. They are top inputs to T3, explaining why T3 is ON–OFF. T2 is ON–OFF because its top inputs are L5 and Tm2, which respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels."
2137,"Note that the Tm1 input to T2 and the L5 input to T2 are second from the top and therefore do not show up in Fig. 6, which is restricted to the top inputs and outputs. Several types are nearby T2 and T3 in the cell types dendrogram."
2138,"In particular, T2a, Tm21, Tm25, Tm27, TmY3, and Y3 are fairly numerous and excitatory, so we regard them as candidate object detectors. Despite its name, T2a is more similar to T3 in connectivity than to T2. T2a also receives Mi1 and Tm1 input like T3 and is predicted to be ON–OFF."
2139,"The top output of T2a is LC17, which is known to be activated by small objects and also receives input from T3. Cluster 12 contains Li19 and Li25. Cluster 9 is both a strong input to cluster 12 and a strong output of cluster 12, largely due to connections between Tm21 and Cluster 12."
2140,"We therefore include cluster 12 as well as cluster 9 in the object subsystem. The inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 are important for Drosophila colour vision because their responses are more narrowly tuned to the wavelength of light than those of the outer photoreceptors R1–6. R7 prefers ultraviolet light, whereas R8 prefers blue or green light."
2141,"Cluster 4 contains Dm8a, Dm8b, Dm11, and DmDRA2, which are all inner photoreceptor targets. Cluster 1 contains most of the remaining types so far implicated in colour vision. As originally defined by morphology, Tm5 is a potential postsynaptic target of the inner photoreceptors because it stratifies in the distal medulla at the M7 border and also in the M3."
2142,These are the medulla layers containing the axon terminals of R7 and R8. We found that Tm5 consists of six cell types. Three of our connectomic Tm5 types correspond to canonical Tm5 types that were previously defined by morphology and Ort expression.
2143,"Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 input, while Tm5c receives R8 input. Moreover, we found three new types, Tm5d, Tm5e, and Tm5f, that receive little or no photoreceptor input, although their stratifications are similar to those of the canonical Tm5 types. The correspondences between connectomic and morphological-molecular Tm5 types were established using morphological criteria."
2144,"However, the reader should be cautioned that there is considerable variability within a type, so reliably typing individual cells based on morphology alone is difficult or impossible. Connectivity is essential for reliable discrimination. Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 and Dm8 input, as expected from previous reports."
2145,"Tm5c receives R8 input and also strong L3 input. While some synapses from Dm8 to Tm5c do exist, this connection seems to be weak. Tm20 has been implicated in color vision because it receives R8 input."
2146,"It also receives strong L3 input. Thus, Tm20 inputs are similar to Tm5c inputs, consistent with the physiological finding that these two types are more similar to each other in their chromatic responses than they are to Tm5a and Tm5b. As Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c, and Tm20 are known to be related to color vision, we propose that the rest of cluster 1 is also part of a hypothetical color subsystem."
2147,"The new Tm5 types receive few or no synapses directly from photoreceptors, but Tm5d receives indirect R7 input from Tm5b and Dm8a, Tm5e receives indirect R8 input from Tm5c, and Tm5f receives indirect R8 input from Tm20. Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic. We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective."
2148,"As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative. Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a and Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37."
2149,"The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla. Nevertheless, we decided to categorize them into the Tm family."
2150,"Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic. Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic."
2151,"Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10. Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs."
2152,"Mi4 has strong partners in the colour and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which has been assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the colour subsystem. This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem."
2153,"Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. Tm20, Tm5d, and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic."
2154,"We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective. As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative."
2155,"Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a, Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37. The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla."
2156,"Nevertheless, we decided to include them in the Tm family. Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted not to be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic."
2157,"Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic. Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm, and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10."
2158,"Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs. Mi4 has strong partners in the colour and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which has been assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the colour subsystem."
2159,"This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem. Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4 and Tlp4."
2160,"In the first stage of morphology-based classification, these errant cells were assigned to Y11. However, such pseudo-Y11 cells were later reassigned to Tlp4 on the basis of connectivity. Their feature vectors match Tlp4 because their medullary projections make few synapses, and their connectivity in the lobula and lobula plate matches Tlp4."
2161,"It is worth mentioning an unusual example in which ignoring morphological variation is correct in one sense but ultimately turns out to be misleading. Three Li11 cells are annotated in the hemibrain reconstruction, and three corresponding cells can be identified in our optic lobe. We group two of these cells into one type."
2162,"The third cell can be paired with a fourth to form a pseudo-Li11 type with a small axonal projection into the central brain. Although the axon is visually striking, it has few synapses and therefore little impact on connectivity. Thus, it might be tempting to ignore the axon as a developmental ""accident"" and merge Li11 and pseudo-Li11 into a single type."
2163,"But it turns out that Li11 and pseudo-Li11 are distinct types, owing to their different connectivity in the lobula. For example, Li25 has strong LT61 output, while pseudo-Li11 has strong LT11 input. Pseudo-Li11 also exists in the hemibrain, although there it lacks the small projection."
2164,"So the central brain projection of pseudo-Li11 exhibits variability across individuals, providing further evidence that it is a developmental accident. We introduce the new names Li25 and Li19 to replace Li11 and pseudo-Li11. A few cells were dismissed as developmental accidents. This could be done with high confidence when the cells were small and few in number."
2165,"However, we had difficulty deciding about Li29 because it was a full-field cell in the lobula, but it also extended a smaller secondary arbor into the lobula plate. Originally, we decided that this cell was a developmental accident and did not include it in our list of types. Later, we found that this odd-looking cell is repeated in the left optic lobe and promoted it to a type."
2166,"Spatial coverage: All cell typing efforts must decide whether to split types more finely or merge types more coarsely. We resolved this lumper-splitter dilemma by using spatial coverage as a criterion. As a general rule, the cells of a cell type collectively cover all columns of the optic lobe with a density that is fairly uniform across the visual field."
2167,"This approach makes sense for implementing translation-invariant computations, a strategy that is commonly used in convolutional networks and other computer vision algorithms. Uniform spatial coverage is sometimes called ""tiling,"" although cell type arbors often overlap so much that the analogy to floor tiles is misleading. Spatial coverage is also a property of many cell types in the mammalian retina."
2168,"In some types consisting of just one or a few cells, we identified an unconventional jigsaw-style spatial coverage. For example, LPi14, also known as LPi1-210, is a pair of full-field cells. We refer to them as a jigsaw pair because they jointly cover the visual field in an irregular manner, as if they were cut by a jigsaw."
2169,"Jigsaw types can also be found in other interneuron families and include Pm14, Li27, and Li28. Our feature vector includes no explicit information about the spatial coordinates of a cell. Thus, if clustering feature vectors results in cell types with good spatial coverage, that is an independent validation of the clustering."
2170,"Coverage also solves the lumper-splitter dilemma. Suppose that we attempt to split one type into two candidate types based on hierarchical clustering. If both candidate types exhibit good coverage, then we accept them as valid."
2171,"If the cells of both candidate types seem randomly scattered, that means our split is invalid because it is presumably discriminating between cells based on noise. Chromatic types like Tm5 and Dm8 might seem to be an exception to this rule, but their apparently random locations may turn out to depend systematically on pale and yellow columns. The above are easy cases, but there are also edge cases."
2172,"Suppose that splitting results in two candidate types that neatly cover the dorsal field and the ventral field, respectively, without overlap. We then reject the split, preferring to lump the two candidate types into a single type that exhibits dorsoventral spatial variation in connectivity. On the other hand, if one candidate type covers the dorsal field and the other covers the full field, this is an acceptable split."
2173,"With these heuristics, some of our cell types end up with only partial coverage of the visual field. This is especially common for boundary types. Sm is the intrinsic type family containing the most types with partial coverage."
2174,"This makes sense, given that Sm cells interact closely with many boundary types arborizing in the serpentine layer. Cell types with partial coverage make sense in the later stages of vision. After the early stages of vision, computer vision also often discards translation invariance and may perform different visual computations in different regions of the visual field."
2175,"Discussion: The connectomic approach to cell typing has three powers. First, it is not subject to the incomplete and biased sampling that can affect other methods. Second, connectivity turns out to provide a rich set of features for distinguishing between cell types."
2176,"Third, connectomic cell typing not only yields cell types but also, importantly, tells us how they are wired to each other. Implications for visual function: We clustered cell types with similar connectivity patterns and proposed tentative interpretations of the clusters in terms of visual functions. These interpretations are speculations but should be useful for generating hypotheses that suggest interesting experiments."
2177,"Our hypothetical subsystems are devoted to motion, object, and color vision, and are fed by ON, OFF, and luminance channels. The motion subsystem contains not only the T4 and T5 families but also many interneuron types. Most interneuron types belong to the LPi family, which has been proposed to mediate opponent interactions between cells that are activated by different directions of motion."
2178,"Such opponency was demonstrated between LPi09 and LPi11, also known as LPi3-4 and LPi4-357. It is likely that LPi types can also mediate spatial normalization, as described in a companion paper. Of the 51 types in the hypothetical object subsystem, T2 and T3 have been characterized by physiologists as object detectors."
2179,"Above, we hypothesized that a number of other types are object detectors, and these candidates can be tested by future experiments. The hypothetical color subsystem contains 91 types. One can only speculate about the reason for this numeric preponderance."
2180,"Some insects are known to have sophisticated color vision capabilities such as color constancy. The computations required for color constancy are quite complex, requiring the integration of image information over long ranges. This could potentially be implemented by the large number of Sm and Li interneuron types in the hypothetical color subsystem, assuming that Drosophila turns out to exhibit color constancy."
2181,"Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 1 and cluster 3 have additional functions other than color vision and should be subdivided more finely. Future experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. A companion paper predicts that the six types in cluster 2 should exhibit orientation selectivity and hypothesizes that cluster 2 is a subsystem for form vision."
2182,"Cluster 2 connects to Cluster 1, suggesting an interaction between form and color computations. Although we have divided the optic lobe into distinct subsystems, we are aware that it is simplistic to assign every cell type to just one functional subsystem. This is the result of the ""hard"" clustering algorithm that we have used, which always assigns a cell type to a single cluster."
2183,"In reality, a cell type could have more than one function, or a cell type might mediate interactions between more than one subsystem. The wiring diagrams show many connections between cell types in different subsystems. Assigning such a cell type to a single subsystem is inherently ambiguous."
2184,"Implications for visual development: The detailed wiring diagram for an adult visual system precisely specifies the end goal of visual system development. Single-cell transcriptomics is providing detailed information about the molecules in fly visual neurons. Comparison of transcriptomic and connectomic information is already uncovering molecules that are important for the development of the fly visual system, and this trend is bound to increase in momentum."
2185,"Such research could be aided by our low-dimensional discriminators of cell types. Complete and unbiased early studies relied on Golgi staining to sample neurons from multiple individuals, a technique that is best suited for identifying the most numerous types. Most of our new types are not as numerous, which may be why they were missed."
2186,"Furthermore, Golgi studies may have mistaken morphological variants for types, which could explain why many of their types cannot be identified in our optic lobe. Contemporary light-microscopy anatomy leverages genetic lines, but still does not evade the limitations of incomplete and biased sampling. The story of Tm5 serves as a case in point."
2187,"A breakthrough in color vision started by genetically labeling neurons that express the histamine receptor Ort. Researchers reasoned that Ort would be expressed by cells postsynaptic to the chromatic photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are histaminergic. Then, light-microscopy anatomy was used to make fine distinctions between three Tm5 types labeled in the transgenic line."
2188,"The present connectomic work has revealed six Tm5 types, a finding that was only foreshadowed by previous work on the same EM dataset. The three new Tm5 types were presumably missed by previous studies because they receive little or no direct photoreceptor input, and do not express Ort. Nevertheless, they are similar to the old Tm5 types in morphology and connectivity, and have been grouped in the hypothetical color subsystem."
2189,"The Tm5 example demonstrates that connectomics can find fresh patches in well-trodden ground. More telling is that connectomics can guide us to entirely new landscapes, such as the 43 Sm types in an entirely new type family. Distinguishing cell types using connectivity features based on connectivity enabled us to discriminate between cell types that stratify in very similar neuropil layers."
2190,"Stratification constrains connectivity because neurons cannot connect with each other unless they overlap in the same layers. However, stratification does not completely determine connectivity because neurons in the same layer may or may not connect with each other. Classical neuroanatomy, whether based on Golgi or genetic staining, relied on stratification because it could be seen with a light microscope."
2191,"Now that we have electron microscopy data, we can rely on connectivity for cell typing rather than settle for stratification as a proxy. That being said, the present study used only connectivity at the final stage of cell typing, which was seeded by the morphological types identified during the first and second stages. It was possible to demonstrate self-consistency of the final cell types using connectivity-based features only."
2192,"We expect that it should be possible to eliminate all dependence on morphological typing and base the approach on connectivity from start to finish. This challenge is left for future work. Spatial organization of connectivity: According to our wiring diagrams, whether two neurons are connected depends on their cell types."
2193,"Connectivity also depends on the locations of the neurons in the retinotopic maps of the optic lobe. As a trivial example, it is impossible for cells with small arbors to be connected if they are at distant locations. Less trivial dependencies of connectivity on location also exist."
2194,"We expect them to be important for understanding vision, although they turned out to be unnecessary for classifying cell types. To facilitate spatial analyses of connectivity, the FlyWire Codex maps a number of cell types to locations in the hexagonal lattice of columns and ommatidia. In such analyses, it may be helpful to regard cell types and spatial locations as discrete and continuous latent variables."
2195,A companion paper demonstrates how to predict visual function by characterizing how connectivity depends on both cell type and spatial location. The cell types of cluster 2 are predicted to exhibit orientation selectivity and related phenomena reminiscent of the primary visual cortex.
2196,"This paper began by recounting the story of how wiring diagrams for the visual cortex drawn in the 1960s inspired convolutional nets, which eventually sparked the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. Convolutional nets have now been applied to reconstruct the fly brain from electron microscopy images, making the current study possible. Coming full circle, the fly optic lobe turns out to be as literal an implementation of a convolutional net as one could ever expect from a biological system. The columns of the optic lobe form a hexagonal lattice, rather than the square lattice used in computer vision, but it is a highly regular lattice nonetheless, and the activities of the neurons in each cell type are analogous to a feature map in a convolutional net."
2197,"Although the connectional architecture of the optic lobe conforms closely to the definition of a convolutional net, the connections do not appear to be learned in the sense of artificial intelligence. No changes in VPN structure and function, and only subtle changes in visual behavior have been detected after rearing flies in darkness, suggesting that visual experience may have little role in Drosophila visual development. However, mechanisms based on spontaneous activity in the pupal brain might have a role."
2198,"In the central brain of Drosophila, cell types usually consist of just a pair of mirror symmetric neurons, as is also the case for C. elegans. By contrast, most optic lobe cell types are represented by many neurons, a situation that is more reminiscent of mammalian brains."
2199,"Could our connectomic approach generalize to mammalian brain structures such as the retina and cortex, which are laminated like the optic lobe? Single-cell transcriptomics, often hailed as the solution to classifying cortical cell types, has also been applied to the Drosophila optic lobe. One study reported 172 transcriptomic cell types, a figure that includes VPNs as well as intrinsic neurons."
2200,"Our connectomic study has revealed the existence of a much larger set of types. Encouragingly, many connectomic types can be conclusively matched with transcriptomic types. Failures to match are interesting because they illustrate potential pitfalls of the transcriptomic approach."
2201,"For example, all eight T4/T5 types look like a single transcriptomic type in adult flies, and are only transcriptionally distinct at earlier stages of development. This could be analogous to the fact that adult cortical neurons of the same transcriptomic type can have highly variable morphological properties. It will be important to scale up the connectomic approach and make it as definitive for the cortex as it is now for the fly visual system."
2202,"A first attempt has already been made in the visual cortex. As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function."
2203,"Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analyzing its structure to predict that three Dm3 and three TmY cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning, position invariance, and the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
2204,"The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision. The 40,000 neurons in the optic lobe of the Drosophila brain have now been completely classified into cell types."
2205,"Although the 200+ cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe are well defined by structural analysis, their functions are largely unknown because less than 20% have had their visual responses recorded by neurophysiologists. For the most part, at present, the online catalog of visual cell types is an enigmatic museum of structures without functions. A beautiful example is Dm3, a trio of neuronal cell types that are intrinsic to the distal medulla."
2206,"A Dm3 cell is tangentially oriented and orthogonal to the columnar cells that project from the medulla to other neuropils. The three Dm3 types are easily distinguished from each other because their dendrites point in three directions. For interactive visualizations of cells and pathways, see the URLs in Supplementary Data 1."
2207,Dm3 was originally called the line amacrine cell when it was discovered in 1970 in dipterans. It was named Dm3 in Drosophila in 1989 and split into two types in 2015. A third Dm3 type was recently identified in a large-scale connectomic census.
2208,No recordings of Dm3 visual responses have ever been reported by physiologists. Dm3 function has remained unknown. I will begin by attempting to predict Dm3 function from structure.
2209,"The field of connectomics has been motivated by a conviction that the computational capabilities of the brain depend strongly on the connectome. Indeed, neural circuit functions such as the computation of visual motion, heading direction, and reward and punishment signals are now known to be supported by specific patterns of neural connectivity in the Drosophila brain. These successes of structural explanation came after neurophysiologists had already identified circuit functions."
2210,"The present study attempts to go beyond explaining post facto. I tackle the challenge of predicting function ex ante, a more stringent test of the power of structure–function relationships. Predictions of Dm3 receptive fields The receptive field of a visual neuron was classically defined as ""the region of the retina which must be illuminated in order to obtain a response."""
2211,"I predict Dm3 receptive fields by mapping their input connections from Tm1, a cell type that is in one-to-one correspondence with the hexels of the compound eye. Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3, and Dm3 is a strong output of Tm1. Figure 1e shows a typical Dm3 cell receiving strong Tm1 input in three collinear columns, even though the cell extends over many columns."
2212,The Tm1 cells presynaptic to each Dm3v cell were mapped to a hexagonal lattice. The color of each hexel indicates the number of synapses received by the Dm3v cell from Tm1 cells. Aligning and averaging all maps yielded an average Tm1–Dm3v input map.
2213,This procedure was repeated for all three Dm3 types. The resulting average maps show that the three Dm3 types are aligned to the three cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. Cell-to-cell variation is visible in the individual maps for single Dm3 cells.
2214,"To quantify variability, each Tm1–Dm3 connectivity map was approximated as an ellipse. The distributions of angular orientations for the Dm3 populations overlap little, and the median angles are close to the cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The aspect ratios of the ellipses have median values near 4 for all Dm3 populations."
2215,"To further characterize the size and shape of the predicted receptive fields, one-dimensional projections of Tm1–Dm3 maps were computed. The longitudinal and transverse projections provide information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively. Standard deviations are marked to provide information about variability across cells."
2216,"The Tm1 receptive field is radially symmetric, with a center that is about one ommatidium wide. As this is so narrow, Tm1–Dm3 connectivity maps can be regarded as estimates of Dm3 receptive fields, assuming that a Dm3 cell sums inputs from its presynaptic Tm1 cells. Orientation selectivity was discovered in the mammalian primary visual cortex and found to be related to the spatial orientation of the receptive field."
2217,"As the predicted receptive fields of Dm3 are oriented, I likewise predict that Dm3 cells prefer stimuli at the three cardinal orientations. Although Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3 by a large margin, Dm3 also receives weaker input from other ""hexel cell types."" Maps of their connectivity with Dm3 look similar to Tm1–Dm3 maps."
2218,"Like Tm1, these inputs are known to have receptive field centers that are roughly a single ommatidium in width and therefore are not expected to change the shape of the receptive field estimated from Tm1. All of these inputs are consistent with the prediction that Dm3 cells have OFF receptive fields. Predictions of TmY receptive fields top targets of Dm3 include TmY4 and TmY9, which project from the distal medulla to the lobula and lobula plate."
2219,"In the distal medulla, TmY4 dendrites are horizontally oriented, extending symmetrically on two sides of the main trunk. TmY9 has been split into TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. In the distal medulla, both TmY9 types have dendrites that are asymmetrically directed to one side of the main trunk along the q and q⟂ directions."
2220,"Tm1 is one of the top inputs to TmY4 and TmY9. Once again, I predict receptive fields by mapping Tm1 inputs. The average maps have three distinct orientations."
2221,Cell-to-cell variability is visualized by approximating ellipses. The median orientations of the TmY4 and TmY9q⟂ ellipses are well approximated by the horizontal and q⟂ orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The median orientation of the TmY9q ellipses is between the q and p⟂ orientations and closer to q.
2222,"Roughly speaking, each TmY orientation is orthogonal to one of the Dm3 orientations, although the orthogonality of TmY9q and Dm3p is less than perfect. Aspect ratios of the ellipses indicate the degree of anisotropy. Longitudinal and transverse 1D projections of Tm1–TmY maps provide complementary information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively."
2223,"From these estimates of receptive fields, TmY4, TmY9q, and TmY9q⟂ are predicted to prefer visual stimuli at the horizontal, q, and q⟂ orientations, respectively. On the basis of their strong Tm1 inputs, TmY4 and TmY9 are predicted to be OFF cells, although they also receive input from the ON hexel type Mi1. Monosynaptic inputs to individual TmY cells from Tm1, Mi1, and other hexel types are mapped in supplementary data."
2224,"Connectivity between Dm3 and TmY types indicates that Dm3 and TmY neurons are connected with each other. Dm3 is presumed to have inhibitory synaptic effects on other cells, while TmY is presumed to be excitatory, based on evidence from both electron micrographs and transcriptomic data. Each Dm3 type avoids synapsing onto cells of the same type and prefers to synapse onto the other two Dm3 types, which have different dendrite orientations."
2225,"Each Dm3 type prefers to synapse onto a single TmY type, that with the orthogonal dendrite orientation. Therefore, Dm3 output connectivity conforms to cross-orientation inhibition, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 50 years ago. TmY cells prefer to synapse onto TmY cells of the same type."
2226,"It follows that TmY–TmY connectivity conforms approximately to iso-orientation excitation, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 40 years ago. In addition, there is some weaker connectivity from TmY9q to TmY9q⟂. TmY4 and TmY9q cells synapse onto Dm3 cells of the orthogonal orientation."
2227,"By contrast, TmY9q⟂ shows no preference, synapsing onto Dm3 cells of all orientations. Therefore, TmY-to-Dm3 connectivity is a combination of cross-orientation and indiscriminate connectivity. The above connectivity patterns are represented schematically in the figure."
2228,This is effectively a thresholded version that will be used in subsequent analyses.
2229,"One illustration shows a Dm3 cell synapsing onto another Dm3 cell, which in turn synapses onto a TmY cell. Another illustration depicts reciprocally connected TmY4 cells. These visualizations suggest that there are spatial relationships between the connected cells, which are not described by population-level wiring diagrams."
2230,"The consequences of these spatial relationships for the visual responses of cells will be predicted below. Dm3 extraclassical receptive fields located outside the classical receptive field may modulate the response to stimulation of the classical receptive field. These areas are sometimes called the extraclassical receptive field. By definition, stimulating the extraclassical receptive field alone should not result in any response."
2231,"The amount of modulation induced by ERF stimulation may depend on the orientation, contrast, or other properties of the modulating stimulus. Locations outside an oriented CRF near the longitudinal axis will be called the end zones, and locations near the transverse axis will be called the side zones. I propose that the ERF of Dm3 cells is determined by disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3."
2232,"I searched for such pathways with the greatest anatomical strength. In brief, the strength of the A-to-B connection was defined as the fraction of input synapses to cell type B provided by cell type A."
2233,"The strength of the A-to-B-to-C disynaptic pathway was then defined as the product of the A-to-B and B-to-C strengths. Details about this strength estimate and its limitations are given in the Methods. Strong disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 were mapped, aligned, and averaged across Dm3 cells."
2234,"For each Dm3 type, the average disynaptic pathway map overlaps with the average predicted CRF but also extends beyond it. The beyond-the-CRF portion of each disynaptic pathway map will be regarded as a component of the predicted ERF. Henceforth, “pERF” and “pCRF” will be used as abbreviations for the predicted ERF component and predicted CRF, respectively."
2235,"As the maps do not have sharp borders, they will be approximated as ellipses for the purpose of defining beyond-the-CRF regions. For each Dm3 type, the strongest two pERFs are from the other two Dm3 types. These mostly extend into the side zones of the pCRF and are predicted to be suppressive because Dm3 is presumed inhibitory."
2236,Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. The next strongest pERF is mediated by T2a and is predicted to be facilitating because T2a is presumed excitatory. The T2a-mediated average pERF covers both end zones of the Dm3v pCRF and mainly the posterior end zone of the Dm3p and Dm3q pCRFs.
2237,"Ellipse approximations to Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps for individual Dm3 cells show that their orientations tend to be similar to those of the Dm3 pCRFs. For some Dm3p and Dm3q cells, the Tm1–T2a–Dm3 map is small and located in the pCRF end zone, not overlapping with the pCRF at all. This shows up as a hotspot in the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps."
2238,1D projections of the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps show that they tend to be longer than the pCRFs and result in pERFs that are biased towards the posterior pCRF end zone of Dm3p and Dm3q. The remaining disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 are substantially weaker by anatomical strength but are included for completeness because they might turn out to be physiologically strong. It is not easy to predict the overall effect at locations where suppressive and facilitating pERFs overlap.
2239,"I predict that suppression will be prominent in the pCRF side zones, where the Dm3-mediated pERFs seem numerically stronger. In the end zones, the T2a-mediated pERFs are largely unopposed by suppression and should lead to facilitation that is not selective for orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus. pERFs for individual Dm3 cells are provided in Supplementary Data 3."
2240,"There is considerable variability across cells of the same type, but the geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. I predict the ERF of TmY cells by considering disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to TmY types. The strongest pathways are mediated by Dm3, and the resulting pERF covers mainly the pCRF side zones and is expected to be suppressive."
2241,"Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. Of the weaker pERFs that are facilitating, the TmY–TmY pERF extends the farthest into the pCRF end zones. Ellipse approximations show the degree of variability across cells."
2242,"One-dimensional projections show that the pERF extends into both end zones. This pathway could lead to iso-orientation facilitation in the end zones, as the TmY–TmY connections are between the same TmY type. The extension of the facilitating TmY–TmY pERF into the pCRF end zones is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity aids in the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
2243,"A similar “collinear facilitation” in the visual cortex has been proposed to enable the completion of noisy or illusory contours, because an orientation detector receiving weak or ambiguous input from the image can be driven over the threshold by excitation from neighboring orientation detectors. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones. This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity."
2244,"pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in supplementary data. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs hold for many individual cells. Prediction of spatial normalization: The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute."
2245,"Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation. In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY."
2246,"A similar excitatory–inhibitory motif is found for many types in the Dm interneuron family and can be viewed as implementing spatial normalization, a common computation in image processing. The inhibitory neuron pools activity of excitatory neurons over some spatial neighborhood and sends recurrent inhibition back to the same excitatory neurons. An unusual aspect here is that recurrent inhibition in the Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY pathway is opposed by recurrent excitation in the Tm1–TmY–TmY pathway in the case of side-by-side stimuli at the preferred orientation."
2247,"I have predicted that the three Dm3 and three TmY types respond selectively to the local orientation of a visual stimulus. This is conceptualized as a decomposition of the image into small oriented elements such as edges or bars, similar to early visual processing in computer science as well as models of the visual cortex. In such models, the computation of local orientation is a general starting point for recognizing all visual forms by subsequent processing steps."
2248,"Similarly, information about local stimulus orientation might be used by the fly brain for form vision. TmY cells synapse onto a number of visual projection neurons that project out of the optic lobe into the central brain. I will focus on the most numerous of these VPN types, LC15 and LC10e, which number about 50 cells each."
2249,"These are of particular interest because they retain more information about location and are therefore potentially more useful for recognizing complex visual forms. The other VPNs, by contrast, discard more information about location by pooling widely over space and will be studied elsewhere. LC15 invariance to orientation: LC15 neurons project from the lobula to the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, a neuropil in the central brain."
2250,"LC15 receives input from all three TmY types. Direct connections from hexel types to LC15 are weak or non-existent, so here the top disynaptic pathways are mapped to predict feature selectivity. Aligning and averaging the maps yields."
2251,Maps for individual cells are in Supplementary Data 5 and are summarized by ellipses in Fig. 6c.
2252,"Given that the LC15 input from TmY cells of all three orientations is indiscriminate, it is natural to reason that LC15 responds indiscriminately to any orientation, detecting a disjunction of activity in the three channels. If TmY orientation tuning is sufficiently broad, it follows that LC15 should be activated by a stimulus of any orientation. Indeed, recordings of LC15 visual responses show that LC15 is activated by bars of any orientation."
2253,"Other strong intermediaries of disynaptic pathways include T3, Tm25, and Tm21. T3 is known to be a small-object detector, and Tm25 and Tm21 may be object detectors based on their connectivity. Indeed, recordings of LC15 responses show that LC15 is also activated by small objects, although not as strongly as by bars."
2254,LC10e is a possible junction detector. LC10 neurons project from the lobula to the anterior optic tubercle of the central brain. LC10 has been divided into four types with distinct stratification profiles in the lobula. I identified a new LC10e type and further subdivided it into dorsal and ventral variants based on their distinct connectivity patterns.
2255,"Both variants receive inputs from TmY9 types, but these inputs are stronger for LC10ev, so I will focus on it. Disynaptic pathways starting from hexel types were mapped, and the top intermediaries turned out to be TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. The maps were aligned and averaged."
2256,The average Tm1–TmY9q–LC10ev map is to the left of the average Tm1–TmY9q⟂–LC10ev map. The displacement vectors between ellipse centers are within 90° of the q direction for almost all LC10ev cells. This suggests a systematic spatial relationship between the receptive field components mediated by TmY9q and TmY9q⟂.
2257,"Noisiness in this relationship is evident in the maps for individual cells, but many individual cells are consistent with the systematic relationship. Although LC10ev receives input from both TmY9q and TmY9q⟂, it is unclear how these two pathways interact. One possibility is that LC10ev, like LC15, detects a disjunction of activity in two pathways and responds to a stimulus at either the q or q⟂ orientation."
2258,"Another possibility is that LC10ev detects a conjunction of activity in the two pathways. In the latter case, LC10ev could be a detector of corners or T-junctions, owing to the systematic spatial relationship evident in the figures."
2259,"This is just speculation because there are additional strong inputs to LC10ev other than TmY9, and it is unclear how they shape the feature selectivity of LC10ev. TmY pERFs mediated by T4 and T5 cells cover the pCRF end zones and are facilitating. T4 and T5 neurons are activated by motion and are also known to prefer oriented stimuli."
2260,"Therefore, input from the motion system may enhance the orientation selectivity of TmY cells and also cause TmY responses to be stronger for moving stimuli than for flashed stimuli. Dm3 inputs and outputs do not contain cell types known to encode motion direction. TmY4 receives inhibition from several lobula plate interneurons, including the full-field cells LPi14 and LPi15, which are presumed to be inhibitory and receive strong input from T4a and T5a, and from T4b and T5b, respectively."
2261,"This suggests that TmY4 might be suppressed by horizontal background motion. TmY9q⟂ receives input from LPi07, suggesting that TmY9q⟂ might be suppressed by vertical background motion if LPi07 is inhibitory, because LPi07 receives input from T4c and T5c, as well as from T4d and T5d. TmY outputs include motion-related types."
2262,"TmY4 synapses onto LPi07 cells, which synapse onto T4c and T5c, as well as from T4d and T5d. TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ synapse onto a number of types that are reciprocally coupled to T4 and T5 cells. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones."
2263,This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity. pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in supplementary data.

2281,"Recordings of these additional intermediary types have not been reported, but a companion paper uses connectivity to speculate that they are involved in color vision. By interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram, I have predicted visual responses of Drosophila neurons that have not previously been recorded by neurophysiologists."
2282,"Testing these predictions seems bound to be informative, whether or not they turn out to be correct. CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted by mapping monosynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells and found to be oriented. On this basis, Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted to be orientation selective."
2283,"pERFs were predicted by mapping disynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells, which involve connections in the Dm3–TmY circuit. A Dm3 pERF mediated by other Dm3 types was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to non-preferred orientations. A Dm3 pERF mediated by T2a was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and not tuned to the orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus."
2284,"A TmY pERF mediated by TmY was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and near side zones, and tuned to modulating stimuli at the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF mediated by Dm3 was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to modulating stimuli orthogonal to the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF due to a trisynaptic pathway mediated by both the same TmY type and the orthogonal Dm3 type was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones for stimuli at the pCRF orientation."
2285,"Although my predictions are powerfully concrete and specific, they also have limitations. First, I relied on the fundamental assumption that the CRF arises from monosynaptic connectivity, and that the ERF arises from polysynaptic pathways that are not paralleled by a monosynaptic connection. One can be confident about the assumption for an inhibitory pathway such as Tm1–Dm3v–TmY4, which by itself should be incapable of activating the TmY4 cell."
2286,"However, stimulating an excitatory pathway such as Tm1–TmY4–TmY4 could conceivably activate the final TmY4 cell, even if the direct Tm1–TmY4 pathway is not stimulated. In general, my fundamental assumption is more certain for inhibitory and less certain for excitatory polysynaptic pathways. If experiments show that the size and shape of CRFs match the predictions, then the fundamental assumption will be upheld, and further experiments can proceed to look for the predicted facilitating and suppressive ERF components. On the other hand, if the CRF turns out to be longer than predicted, that would mean excitatory polysynaptic pathways, here predicted to contribute to the ERF, instead turn out to lengthen the CRF. The prediction of a facilitating ERF in the CRF end zone would become invalid because the end zone would be swallowed up by the lengthened CRF."
2287,The ERF would then be determined solely by inhibitory polysynaptic pathways and be only suppressive. The above uncertainty is related to some ambiguity inherent in the ERF definition. It is supposed to be impossible to evoke a neural response through stimulation of the ERF alone.
2288,"If the definition is revised to substitute difficult for impossible, the distinction between ERF and CRF is no longer black and white. In the second limitation, predictions can be challenging owing to the existence of many polysynaptic pathways that can contribute to the ERF. When relevant pathways are both excitatory and inhibitory, it can be difficult to predict the overall sign of modulation by a stimulus outside the CRF."
2289,"I have accordingly focused my ERF predictions on locations where either excitation or inhibition is likely to dominate. However, there are additional ERF pathways that were not considered above. For example, a companion paper predicts numerous normalization mechanisms that are presynaptic to the Dm3–TmY circuit: Tm1 responses are spatially normalized by five Pm interneuron types that pool over multiple length scales, L2 is normalized by three Dm interneuron types, and the L2–Tm1 connection is normalized by two Dm interneuron types."
2290,"All of these mechanisms are expected to contribute suppressive ERF components that are not tuned to stimulus orientation and could obscure the predicted facilitating ERF components. A third limitation concerns variation across cells of the same type, which is summarized by the ellipses in Figs. 1h, 2j, 4d, 5d, 6c, f and detailed in Supplementary Data 3–5."
2291,"A systematic kind of variation is the distortion of geometric relationships near the borders of the eye. There is also apparently random variation even in the interior of the eye, far from the borders. pERFs tend to look more variable than pCRFs, which may be due in part to randomness in the coverage of the visual field by non-hexel types."
2292,"Finally, my conjecture about LC10e assumes a high threshold for activation, which suggests that LC10e should detect a conjunction of TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ activation triggered by two oriented stimuli arranged in a corner or T-junction. Alternatively, LC10e might detect a disjunction of its inputs if it has a low threshold for activation. LC15 is indiscriminately connected with all three TmY types, and its observed invariance to stimulus orientation suggests that LC15 has a low threshold for activation."
2293,"An additional subtlety, not further discussed here, is that the threshold actually varies dynamically due to the presence of inhibitory inputs. In principle, some of the above limitations could be overcome by building network models of neural activity. That might not improve the predictive power at this time, however, because so many model parameters are unknown at present."
2294,"Synapse counts are only crude estimates of physiological connection strength, and unitary conductance can differ markedly between inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Other uncertainties, such as whether inhibition should be modeled as subtractive or divisive, go beyond parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out experiments that reduce model uncertainty."
2295,"If visual physiologists measure orientation and location tuning curves, that would constrain the strength of cross-orientation inhibition relative to direct Tm1 excitation, as well as the relative strengths of ERF pathways. Biophysical experiments would clarify the extent to which voltage varies throughout a neuronal arbor, which is important because pCRF and pERF pathways may terminate in synapses at different locations on the arbor. Discussion: Convolutional nets are a popular approach to form vision in artificial intelligence."
2296,"Optic lobe cell types can be interpreted as feature maps in a convolutional net, and average Tm1–Dm3 and Tm1–TmY connectivity maps can be interpreted as convolution kernels. LC10e and LC15 combine inputs from TmY cells and may be regarded as complex feature detectors built by combining inputs from simpler feature detectors. This accords with the original hierarchical conception of convolutional nets, which was inspired by hypothetical wiring diagrams for primary visual cortex in mammals."
2297,"The wiring of the Dm3–TmY circuit resembles connectivity motifs originally proposed for V1 and some visual responses predicted here for fly neurons have precedents in V1. In particular, a ‘collinear facilitation’ is predicted for the ERF of TmY cells, meaning that a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the end zone can facilitate the response to a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the CRF. Collinear facilitation was previously reported for V1 neurons, but most reports emphasize suppression."
2298,"The conflicting reports might be reconciled if ERFs are generated by diverse parallel polysynaptic pathways. Different visual stimuli might emphasize either excitatory or inhibitory pathways, leading to different experimental results. The ERFs of TmY cells are similarly predicted to be shaped by many overlapping excitatory and inhibitory pathways, but the complexity is constrained by the connectome."
2299,"We can reason about the cell types and connections, observe and manipulate them with the aid of genetic tools, and use them to build neural network models. This new opportunity has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods used to disentangle the effects of overlapping ERF mechanisms in the cortex, such as manipulating stimulus contrast, orientation, and timing. “Line amacrine” cells, probably homologous to Dm3, have been described in several dipteran species."
2300,"If Dm3 and TmY homologues turn out to exist in honeybees, it will be worth comparing them with studies of honeybee behavior, with the caveat that visual acuity is higher and inter-ommatidial spacing is lower in honeybees than in Drosophila. Behavioral experiments were interpreted to infer the existence of “at least three orientation-sensitive channels” in the bee visual system. Orientation-selective neurons were later predicted to span a maximum of three ommatidia."
2301,"This roughly matches the predicted CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells. It is worth noting that Dm3 receptive fields would not previously have been guessed to be so short because Dm3 dendrites are quite long. The predicted CRFs require true connectivity, not just morphology."
2302,"The collinear facilitation predicted for TmY cells could have consequences for insect visual behaviors. Bees were once claimed to perceive illusory contours. The experiments were later declared to be irreproducible, although this belated renunciation seems to have escaped notice."
2303,The topic seems worth reopening if neurophysiology experiments can detect the collinear facilitation predicted here. The design of illusory contour stimuli seems more likely to be successful if guided by neurophysiology as well as behavior. Behavioral experiments with honeybees were used to argue that the orientation of a visual stimulus is computed independently from its direction of motion.
2304,"Orientation selectivity was subsequently discovered in direction-selective T4 and T5 cells of Drosophila. The present work predicts an orientation-selective Dm3–TmY circuit that is indeed distinct from the motion circuit, although there are interactions between them as described above. The Dm3–TmY circuit immediately suggests many questions about neural development."
2305,"Unknowns include the identities of the molecules that guide Dm3 dendrites to grow in three directions and how the Dm3 dendrites “decide” how far to grow, even after turning sharply at the border of the medulla. The molecules that establish connectivity preferences of Dm3 and TmY cells are of obvious interest. There should also be molecules that establish preferences for synapse formation at particular dendritic locations, which are important for the spatial organization of connectivity and remain to be analyzed in future work."
2306,"Many animals use visual information to navigate, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction by integrating visual input from ER neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron microscopy data."
2307,"The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle in the central brain; TuBu neurons, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes, and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input."
2308,"We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations. The AVP encodes visual features that are essential for navigation, potentially including landmarks, intensity gradients, color, celestial bodies, and skylight polarization."
2309,"Considering its fundamental role in navigation, it is not surprising that this anatomical structure is largely conserved across most known insect species. It is likely that deep similarities exist across species in the basic logic of visual feature extraction for navigation. However, despite many studies of the AVP across species, researchers’ knowledge about the AVP neurons has been fragmented due to the lack of a complete circuit diagram to frame systematic investigations."
2310,"Here we aim to provide such a framework in flies, and we anticipate that this will also be invaluable for designing and prioritizing physiological experiments to interrogate the AVP in other species. We identified all neurons and their connectivity in the AVP, using a publicly available electron microscopy dataset that contains the entire adult fly brain, with FlyWire, an AI-assisted collaborative platform. MeTu neurons, the first stage of the AVP, leave the medulla, the largest neuropil in the fly visual system."
2311,"The axons of MeTu neurons innervate the AOTUsu, where the information is further processed by the TuBu neurons that connect the AOTUsu to the bulb. There are ten classes of TuBu neurons, each synapsing onto the dendrites of distinct classes of ER neurons. ER neurons then send ring-like processes to a donut-shaped structure, the ellipsoid body, where they together form a complex recurrent neural network."
2312,"Finally, the visual information from the AVP—along with other sensory modalities—is compiled to compute the heading direction by EPG neurons that share many similarities with mammalian ""head direction"" cells. Our survey of the entire brain showed that visual information originating from optic lobe structures outside the AVP constitutes minimal input to EPG neurons. Thus, we focused our analyses on the medulla-originating AVP."
2313,"Furthermore, although previous anatomical studies of various types of MeTu neurons have generally agreed at the macroscale, the insufficient resolution of light microscopy has resulted in considerable inconsistencies in grouping MeTu types and predicting their connectivity towards the central complex. Hence, we sought to provide a comprehensive view of this pathway in synapse-level detail. Finally, although the connectivity from TuBu to ER to EPG neurons has been studied at synaptic resolution, this dataset contains only one hemisphere and lacks upstream medulla neuropils and photoreceptor terminals."
2314,"Therefore, we sought to reconstruct the entire AVP in both hemispheres to provide a solid foundation for understanding how brains vary across hemispheres and across animals, as well as which visual features are extracted in the AVP. We densely proofread all MeTu neurons, TuBu neurons, and ER neurons. We further reconstructed all medulla-intrinsic Mi1 neurons in the medulla from both hemispheres to map the exact locations of all reconstructed neurons relative to the retinotopic columns in the medulla."
2315,"To assess our proofreading quality, we selected 113 MeTu neurons from the right hemisphere and performed multiple rounds of proofreading. We found that, after the first round, any additional volume reconstructed in each round markedly decreased, and there were no changes in the main backbone. Moreover, all MeTu neurons shared stereotypical arborization patterns in the medulla."
2316,"Therefore, we were confident that our reconstruction quality of the 894 MeTu neurons was sufficiently accurate for categorization and morphological and connectivity analyses. We focused on the detailed connectivity of MeTu neurons because the logic of their connections between optic lobes and the central brain was missing in previous studies. We included results from both hemispheres in most analyses, but where indicated, some detailed analyses were restricted to the right hemisphere because the left hemisphere had an incomplete lamina and EM image alignment issues."
2317,"AOTUsu anatomy defines four MeTu classes. The AOTUsu is innervated by four types of processes: the axons of MeTu neurons, the dendrites of downstream TuBu neurons, and the synaptic terminals of bilaterally projecting AOTU and tubercle-to-tubercle neurons. Drawing on the axonal arborization pattern of MeTu and the dendritic arborization pattern of TuBu, we divided the AOTUsu into four major subregions: posterior lateral, posterior central, anterior, and medial. These anatomical divisions led us to categorize MeTu neurons into four major classes."
2318,"Downstream TuBu neurons were categorized into ten types, consistent with previous works. See Extended Data Fig. 3 for a detailed anatomical description of these four areas and the neurons that innervate them."
2319,"Connectivity reveals ten MeTu subtypes. Within each MeTu class, except MeTu1, we observed discrete morphologies and anatomical innervations, suggesting multiple channels for visual features. To systematically categorize all possible MeTu neuron subtypes, we focused our analysis on the five strongest synaptic partner types; this resulted in 28 types of upstream neurons. Applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction analysis based on the connectivity in the medulla, but not in the AOTUsu, revealed four major patterns of presynaptic inputs, mostly consistent with the four major MeTu classes defined in the previous section."
2320,"We also performed categorization analyses and found ten subtypes. Comparing the expression pattern of genetic driver lines with EM data further corroborated our subtyping of MeTu neurons. MeTu1 neurons form a homogeneous group. Compass neurons are strongly influenced by vertical stripes and their locations in azimuth, whose information is conveyed by ER neurons, probably ER4d."
2321,"This ER neuron type is the only partner downstream of TuBu08, which is, in turn, the only neuron type downstream of MeTu1 neurons. Our analysis of the anatomy and connectivity of MeTu1 neurons helps to explain the mechanisms that underlie the selectivity of ER4d neurons. MeTu1 neurons form thick dendritic branches in the medulla layer 7, with small vertical protrusions extending to layer 6. Dendrites span about 30–40 medulla columns, and each medulla column is innervated by multiple MeTu1 neurons."
2322,"MeTu1 neurons receive the strongest input from Dm2 neurons covering the entire visual field, followed by Sm16, MeTu1, Sm15, and Sm07. The density of synapses drops at a distance of 20 to 30 μm from the medulla centroid of a MeTu1 neuron. The functional implication of recurrent connections between MeTu1 neurons in the medulla remains to be examined."
2323,"The orientation of the MeTu1 dendritic span, when fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, tends to be vertical. We observe that near the anterior and posterior edges, the dendritic spans of MeTu neurons narrow, but future studies are required to ascertain whether this change has functional implications. MeTu1 neurons project axons to the AOTUsu_PL, where they synapse with TuBu08 neurons, among other connections."
2324,"The connection from MeTu1 neurons to TuBu08 neurons is retinotopic; the more anteriorly or posteriorly MeTu1 dendrites are located in the medulla, the more ventrally or dorsally they project in the AOTUsu_PL, respectively. In other words, each TuBu08 neuron receives input from a group of MeTu1 neurons at a particular azimuth, regardless of their elevation in the medulla. Such one-dimensional mapping provides a potential anatomical basis for the selectivity of TuBu08 neurons to vertical bars or to the azimuthal location of visual stimuli, but not to elevation, an anatomical structure similar to the classic model of how simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus."
2325,"MeTu2 subtypes process polarized light. Many insects navigate relying on skylight polarization. In Drosophila, ER4m neurons are the prominent ER neurons that process skylight polarization. MeTu2 neurons, previously designated as MeTu-DRA, are notable as the only upstream inputs of these ER neurons."
2326,"They are clustered in the dorsal half of the medulla, with dendrites mainly tiling the dorsal rim area, where neurons process skylight polarization. Our clustering analysis identified two MeTu2 subtypes with distinct ramifications in the medulla and notably distinct connectivity patterns in the AOTUsu_PC, which we named MeTu2a and MeTu2b. Both subtypes exhibit generally vertical arborizations and similar dendritic spans, but the interconnectivity between MeTu2b in the medulla is much stronger than that between MeTu2a."
2327,"Furthermore, MeTu2b neurons appear to receive more input from MeTu2a than they provide input to MeTu2a. Finally, although both MeTu2 subtypes mainly stratify within medulla layer 7, MeTu2a neurons are postsynaptic to polarization-sensitive R7 neurons only in the DRA and local interneurons DmDRA1, both of which are potentially sensitive to light polarization, whereas MeTu2b inputs also include Mi15, the function of which remains unknown, and a stronger connection from interhemispheric MeMeDRA. Hence, MeTu2b might integrate additional inputs from the contralateral hemisphere, enabling the processing of a more global skylight polarization pattern."
2328,"MeTu2 innervation of the AOTUsu respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1. Also, as in the medulla, MeTu2b neurons are more strongly interconnected in the AOTUsu than are MeTu2a neurons. Moreover, although MeTu2a and MeTu2b both synapse onto TuBu01 and TuBu06, MeTu2b is only weakly connected to TuBu01."
2329,"Finally, MeTu2a and MeTu2b differ in their connections to the bilateral neurons TuTuB_a and TuTuB_b. Overall, these connectivity differences in the AOTUsu_PC, combined with their distinct anatomical features in the medulla, indicate that MeTu2a and MeTu2b are likely to convey distinct features of skylight polarization to downstream circuits, with MeTu2b processing potentially more complex and global polarization patterns. MeTu3 neurons comprise three subtypes. The Drosophila compass neurons can use the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding world to compute the head direction, but the source of this information was unclear."
2330,"Here, we provide evidence that MeTu3 and its downstream neurons process, in addition to skylight polarization, the two-dimensional organization of the scene. Our connectivity analysis identified three distinct MeTu3 subtypes with regionalized clusters of dendrites. MeTu3a has dendrites that cluster in the dorsal third of the medulla, are confined to layer 7, and specifically lack vertical protrusions across medulla layers."
2331,"MeTu3a is the only MeTu3 subtype that receives polarization information through input from DmDRA1, similar to MeTu2a and MeTu2b. MeTu3b cells have dendrites that are clustered most densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend to the ventral two-thirds, with pronounced vertical protrusions that cover layers 5, 6, and 7. They receive direct inhibitory input from ultraviolet-sensitive R7 photoreceptors and indirect input from blue/green-sensitive R8 cells through Mi15, which suggests that they have a role in processing chromatic information."
2332,"MeTu3c cells have dendrites that are more ventral than those of MeTu3b, covering the equator and some of the ventral part of the medulla. Dendritic processes innervate the same layers as MeTu3b and receive the same direct and indirect photoreceptor inputs, suggesting similar chromatic coding to that of MeTu3b. MeTu3 innervation of the AOTUsu_A respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1 and MeTu2."
2333,"Axons of MeTu3a, MeTu3b, and MeTu3c are not well segregated in the AOTUsu_A, despite the downstream TuBu neurons having well-segregated dendrites. Consequently, some MeTu3 neurons are connected to two TuBu types. All three MeTu3 subtypes are strongly and reciprocally connected to bilateral TuTuB_a neurons."
2334,"Because the TuTuB_a neurotransmitter is predicted to be inhibitory, MeTu3 neurons might exhibit strong bilateral inhibitory interactions across the entire visual field. MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons are mainly connected to TuBu07, upstream of ER3w_ab. This convergence of MeTu3a and MeTu3b suggests that ER3w_ab encodes a combination of skylight polarization and chromatic information of the sky."
2335,"On the other hand, MeTu3c neurons are mostly presynaptic to both TuBu09 and TuBu10. Notably, TuBu09 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more dorsally in the medulla, whereas TuBu10 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more ventrally in the medulla. Thus, the neurons downstream of MeTu3c can encode the elevation of visual stimuli or a two-dimensional organization of visual objects in a surrounding scene."
2336,"This capability is unique among all MeTu neurons. MeTu4 subtypes transmit widefield inputs. Compass neurons receive diverse input from ER neurons, some of which exhibit responses to the contralateral visual field and self-generated motion signals. Considering that these ER neurons, the dendrites of which are in the inferior bulb, are downstream of MeTu4 neurons that originate in the ipsilateral optic lobe, their response pattern was puzzling."
2337,"Our analyses show that MeTu4 neurons receive inputs from distinct parts of the visual world, with virtually no input from a columnar medulla cell type. Instead, they receive input mostly from large interneurons that span many medulla columns and from others that potentially convey motor information from a neuropil called the superior posterior slope to the medulla. These unique properties of MeTu4 might explain the mysterious properties of ER neurons in the inferior bulb."
2338,"On the basis of the connectivity in the medulla and the AOTUsu_M, we categorized MeTu4 into four subgroups: MeTu4a, MeTu4b, MeTu4c, and MeTu4d. The dendrites of MeTu4a cells cluster densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend ventrally, with unique arborization in two medulla layers. Despite their dorsal location, they form no synaptic connections with polarized light-sensitive photoreceptors or DRA neurons."
2339,"MeTu4b neurons are notable for their unique dendritic arrangement: they span a rather small area in the equator, mostly in the posterior–medial part of the medulla that represents the frontal central visual field. The function of this spatial restriction remains unknown. MeTu4c neurons span the entire dorsal half of the medulla, whereas MeTu4d neurons cluster exclusively in the ventral half of the medulla and are ideally positioned to detect features in the ventral visual field."
2340,"Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d receive nearly identical input from a wide variety of interneurons, including those that convey information from other brain areas, such as the SPS. Like all other MeTu types, axonal projections of all MeTu4 neurons maintain anterior–posterior retinotopy in the AOTUsu_M along the ventral–dorsal axis, in contrast to what was found in a previous report. MeTu4a, MeTu4b, and MeTu4c also have presynaptic connections in the lobula, but these connections do not contribute to the AVP and were thus excluded from further analyses."
2341,"In the AOTUsu_M, all MeTu4a neurons are presynaptic to TuBu03; some are also presynaptic to TuBu04. MeTu4b neurons are presynaptic to TuBu02 neurons. Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d subtypes are mainly presynaptic to TuBu05, but MeTu4d also makes presynaptic connections with TuBu02."
2342,"MeTu4b and MeTu4c receive the main interhemispheric connections within the AOTUsu_M: MeTu4b receives strong input from AOTU046 but does not provide reciprocal input into AOTU046, whereas MeTu4c is strongly and reciprocally connected to AOTU046. MeTu4d receives no input from AOTU046 and provides only weak input to AOTU046. Finally, MeTu4d receives weak input from TuTuB_a."
2343,"Variance across hemispheres and brains: We compared the AVP within and across brains. Although our analyses are limited, owing to the lack of optic lobes in the hemibrain dataset and a single optic lobe in the male brain dataset, tentative comparisons are still possible for most MeTu types, on the basis of synapses in the AOTU or optic lobe synapse and cell shapes. The number of neurons of each type was very similar across hemispheres of the same brain, compared to the difference across brains."
2344,"Notably, across brains, only a few cell types showed clear differences in spatial arborization patterns, numbers, or, in very few cases, perhaps even their existence. For example, MeTu4b neurons in FAFB and the male brain optic lobe both have similar spatially restricted arborizations in the medulla, but the FAFB pattern lacks a few cells that are present in the male optic lobe MeTu4b population. Also, the overall number of MeTu4 cells in the male brain dataset is higher, and two other MeTu4 subtypes are identified."
2345,"Careful comparison suggests that MeTu4e in the male optic lobe could be a subset of MeTu4a in FAFB. The source of such variations across brains remains incompletely understood but is likely to be, at least in part, developmental in nature. Extracting visual features along the AVP: A common pattern across all AVP channels is the convergence of MeTu neurons onto a considerably smaller number of TuBu neurons."
2346,"In this transformation, each TuBu neuron integrates information from a large area of the visual field, suggesting spatial feature processing with a lower resolution. TuBu neurons also receive strong input from the contralateral visual field through TuTu neurons. Note that individual MeTu neurons sample the visual area differently depending on their location in the medulla over the anterior–posterior axis."
2347,This results in synapse counts and dendritic field shapes differing by their locations in the medulla along this axis. The effect of this pattern on TuBu integration is not understood at present. The next step in processing—from TuBu to ER neurons—exhibits a re-expansion in the number of neuronal types.
2348,"The ratio of connections from TuBu to ER neurons varies between 0.33 and, for some neurons, 4. Thus, the transformation from TuBu to ER may extract several more visual features."
2349,"Putative receptive fields of ER neurons: To quantify the putative visual area to which each neuron probably responds, we mapped each medulla column to a micro-computed tomography-based eye map of D. melanogaster. Then, for each ER neuron, we back-traced the upstream connections in two ways: one followed TuBu to MeTu connections, and the other followed TuBu to TuTu to ipsi- and contralateral MeTu connections."
2350,"We used the dendritic arborization in the medulla for each pathway to estimate the area of a direct pathway or an indirect pathway. We overlaid them into a single putative receptive field, which we further analyzed to obtain the outline of the visual field of the direct pathway. We then combined outlines of the same type of ER neurons to illustrate the visual area that the population of ER neurons covers."
2351,"Note that the lack of functional data for most optic lobe cell types, including Sm neurons, hinders extensive functional predictions. Thus, our predictions are based mainly on the dendritic fields of MeTu neurons and the known properties of presynaptic neurons. Back-tracing the synaptic pathway starting from an ER4d revealed that its upstream MeTu1 neurons are aligned vertically in the medulla."
2352,"They cover about 40° azimuth and the entire vertical span. This vertical arrangement of MeTu1 neurons was consistent across ER4d neurons and covered the entire visual field as a population, like an array of vertical bars. It suggests that ER4d neurons are selective to vertically elongated visual stimuli or to the location of visual stimuli along the horizontal plane, regardless of the elevation."
2353,"Such a pathway would be best suited for detecting visual landmarks that are appropriate references for setting a heading. By contrast, back-tracing starting from single ER2_ad and ER2_b neurons revealed that they receive information from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located in the dorsal medulla, whereas individual ER2_c neurons receive inputs exclusively from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites in the central medulla. Similar to the channel converging into ER4d neurons, the MeTu3c populations upstream of ER2_ad, ER2_b, and ER2_c neurons tile the entire visual field."
2354,"In other words, the ER2 population tiles the visual field two-dimensionally, providing more organizational details of the scene in two dimensions than do ER4d neurons. Furthermore, the roles of ER4d and ER2 in processing chromatic information might differ: Dm2, the main upstream input of MeTu1, receives inputs predominantly from UV-sensitive pale photoreceptors, which suggests that ER4d neurons could process UV stimuli. On the other hand, Mi15, the main upstream input of MeTu3c, receives input from green-sensitive yellow R8 photoreceptors, which suggests that ER2 neurons process longer-wavelength stimuli."
2355,"Unlike the ER4d and ER2 populations, ER4m and ER5 neurons receive strong input from polarization-sensitive channels involving the DRA-specific MeTu2a and MeTu2b neurons, respectively. As described before, MeTu2b exhibits more complex connectivity than MeTu2a and, therefore, might encode complex features of polarized light. Hence, ER5 might process more complex features of polarized skylight, whereas ER4m seems to process skylight polarization alone as a navigational cue, consistent with a previous report."
2356,"This difference is notable because ER5 is involved in circadian rhythms. ER3w receives input from MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons, potentially combining skylight polarization information and localized visual feature information from some of the dorsal visual field. On the other hand, most other ER3 subtypes with dendrites in the inferior bulb are downstream of MeTu4 subtypes that do not receive columnar input in the medulla."
2357,"Thus, until the functions of upstream neurons are understood, the visual area and features that these ER3 neurons encode will remain unclear. Overall, we predict that ER neurons downstream of MeTu1–MeTu3 neurons encode diverse information including polarized light, vertical stimuli or the azimuthal location of visual features, and the two-dimensional organization of visual scenes, including azimuth and elevation; a system suitable for processing both the elevation of a celestial body and the surrounding two-dimensional environment. Physiologically testing predictions: We performed two-photon calcium imaging to test some of these predictions, especially the spatial extent of the visual field to which ER4d and ER2 neurons respond."
2358,"We imaged the dendritic calcium activity of ER neurons in the superior bulb while presenting square-shaped dot stimuli to the fly using a projector-based visual stimulation setup. Both ER neuron types were excited by ipsilateral visual stimuli, consistent with previous studies. The ellipse contours of the receptive fields of ER4d and ER2 tile the visual space differently."
2359,"As predicted by our connectomic analysis, the receptive fields of ER4d neurons are vertically elongated in height and 31 ± 12° in width, and tile the visual space horizontally. The receptive fields of ER2 neurons, on the other hand, are markedly smaller and tile the visual space in two dimensions. These results precisely match our predictions about the spatial extent of these neurons’ receptive fields."
2360,"Note that the vertical extent of the ER4d receptive fields is much greater than that reported previously; we believe this is due to the limited span of elevation in the set-up used previously. By contrast, we tilted the fly head to expose the eyes to a greater vertical visual span. These results show that informed, systematic predictions can guide experimental designs to reveal previously unexplored dimensions of neural functions."
2361,"Discussion: We observed four essential organization principles of the AVP: a convergence of spatial information from MeTu to TuBu, which suggests the compression of visual information into features with coarse spatial resolution; segregated and parallel processing of spatially overlapping visual features in largely feedforward circuits; parallel pathways for interhemispheric integration, selectively mixing visual features; and divergent feature expansion through TuBu-to-ER connections. Furthermore, by back-tracing from ER neurons to MeTu neurons, we inferred the diverse visual features that compass neurons might use to compute head direction. Our analysis of the reconstructed synaptic pathways reveals that the fly’s visual field can be roughly subdivided into three regions: a narrow band in the dorsal-most visual field; the remaining upper visual field; and the rest of the visual field."
2362,"Of note, the DRA and upper visual fields are occupied by the large majority of MeTu neuron types with overlapping receptive fields; by contrast, the lower and frontal visual fields are served by lower numbers of cells and subtypes. In particular, MeTu4d neurons cover only the ventral half of the visual field. We speculate that this serves to process ventral optic flow or to orient towards shiny surfaces that produce horizontally polarized reflections, which flies detect and use to adjust their body orientation."
2363,"Nine out of the ten parallel information channels formed by MeTu neurons seem to maintain only azimuth information, discarding information about elevation; this strategy seems particularly efficient for computing a heading in azimuth. Only the MeTu3c channel may encode both azimuth and elevation—a property that seems ideal for perceiving the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding environment or for tracking the position of celestial bodies throughout the day. Overall, these organizational patterns of the AVP suggest that Drosophila melanogaster prioritizes the azimuthal position of celestial cues, including the skylight polarization pattern. Animals exhibit specific cue preferences during navigation, and we have long known that visual features are processed hierarchically: dung beetles prioritize skylight polarization or sun location depending on the environmental context, and mammals prioritize the geometry of the surrounding space. However, the field is only just beginning to investigate which visual features are extracted and how they are prioritized across insects and mammals."
2364,"As such, our complete reconstruction of the AVP in flies is essential for mechanistically understanding the circuit implementation and shared functional principles that underlie the prioritization, integration, and transformation of this information into a heading signal. This is exemplified by our experiments that physiologically confirm some of the new predictions. Furthermore, with the ability to dissect detailed circuit dynamics of neural populations using the rich genetic tools in flies, we are poised to gain a deeper understanding of how sensory information is transformed into more abstract representations, which is fundamental to and essential for higher cognitive functions in the brain."
2365,"Walking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear."
2366,"Here, using connectome-informed models and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning."
2367,"The brake neurons, by contrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding, and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Walking recruits distributed neural activity across the brain and spinal cord or nerve cord."
2368,"When an animal halts, the net output of this distributed neural activity notably changes to arrest leg stepping movements. Moreover, depending on the behavioral context, animals halt in different context-appropriate ways. While a few specific neuronal types driving halting have been recently described, how walking-related neural activity changes to allow halting in a manner that is both mechanically stable and appropriate to the behavioral context is currently unclear."
2369,"Identification of halt neurons. To identify neurons involved in halting in Drosophila, we optogenetically activated specific neurons that innervate the suboesophageal zone of the fly brain, a region that houses the neurons close to and including the descending output of the brain. Through this neural-activation screen, we identified 11 genetic drivers that were both relatively sparse and caused halting without gross motor deficits. Among these lines, we could unambiguously pinpoint three causal neurons for halting, which we refer to as Foxglove, Bluebell, and Brake."
2370,"We identified split-Gal4 reagents that targeted FG, BB, and BRK with little to no ectopic expression and drove robust halting, as reflected by a decrease in walking velocity, distance, and rotation. Using connectome parsing tools, we identified these neurons in the brain and nerve-cord connectomes. Both FG and BB are SEZ neurons that stochastically descend until the anterior tip of the nerve cord."
2371,"The FG line has weak ectopic expression in the mushroom body neuropil that does not contribute to the halting phenotype. The BB line also labels an additional neuron previously described as ""bluebird."" BRK is a new neuronal type discovered in this work and drives the strongest halting phenotype."
2372,"BRK comprises six ascending neurons with their somata in each of the six leg-segment-specific neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord and axonal projections to the brain SEZ region. By activating subsets of BRK neurons, we found that activating any of the BRK neurons is sufficient to drive halting. Consistent with this, in the connectome, we found that although each BRK gets distinct inputs, all six BRK share common major outputs in their two output zones, the tectulum of the VNC and the SEZ of the brain."
2373,"Analysis of walking velocities on FG, BB, or BRK stimulation hinted at potential differences in the halting phenotypes. To precisely quantify such differences, we performed high-resolution three-dimensional leg kinematics analysis. BRK drove low-latency, long-duration halting bouts with joint angles locked in a specific position for the entire halt duration."
2374,"By contrast, FG and BB induced halts were interspersed with leg movements. FG drove long halting bouts like BRK but still allowed brief repositioning of legs. BB drove stationary periods interspersed with slow walking and allowed more leg movements."
2375,"Unlike BRK, both FG and BB stimulated flies often took a few steps before halting. Defining the genetic drivers and connectome identities of ""halt"" neurons driving distinct types of halting allowed us to next address their interaction with the walking-promoting circuits. Diversity in walk–halt interactions. To address if and how the newly identified halt neurons interact with walking-promoting pathways, we leveraged genetic tools targeting walking-promoting neurons characterized in our previous work, namely P9 that drives forward turning, BPN that drives straight forward walking, and MDN that drives backward walking."
2376,"We combined split-Gal4 reagents for the walk and halt neurons and confirmed opsin expression in the desired neurons. Here, in addition to the three halt neuron driver lines, and to confirm the role of BB, we used another driver line that targets FG + BB without any ectopic expression. Using these tools, we performed all possible combinations of ""walk + halt"" coactivations."
2377,"BRK stimulation completely suppressed all walking commands, suggesting that it drives a dominant halting mechanism. By contrast, FG and BB activation affected the walk neuron phenotypes with varying degrees and specificity, suggesting distinct halting mechanisms being deployed in these cases. During coactivation with MDN, unlike BRK, FG and BB did not suppress backward walking."
2378,"However, the intermittent switches to forward walking observed during continuous MDN stimulation were absent or markedly reduced, as seen in the individual trial velocity traces. This suggests that FG and BB predominantly suppress forward walking. Consistent with this, when FG or BB were coactivated with P9, the flies showed a marked reduction in forward velocity."
2379,"BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 coactivated flies also showed a corresponding decrease in angular velocity compared to P9-stimulated flies. However, FG + P9 coactivated flies still showed a large increase in angular velocity at stimulation onset. We found that while the BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 flies were predominantly halting during the optogenetic stimulation, FG + P9 flies were pivoting on the spot."
2380,"These observations revealed an unexpected modularity in the P9 downstream pathway into two components: a forward walking component that is suppressed by both FG and BB and a turning component that is suppressed by BB. As the FG + BB line has a similar phenotype as the BB line, we conclude that BB, and not bluebird, is responsible for the forward turning suppression. When FG or BB was coactivated with BPN, the flies still increased forward walking during optogenetic stimulation."
2381,"Whereas this increase in forward walking tended to be smaller than that of activation of BPN alone, only in the case of FG could we see a statistically significant difference in the distance quantification. Although BPN + FG + BB coactivated flies decreased forward walking, it was interspersed with intermittent jumps, possibly due to ectopic expression in the VNC, rendering the distance quantification unreliable. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FG can partially suppress the BPN-driven forward walking."
2382,"To summarize, we found that BRK suppresses all walking commands, FG specifically suppresses forward walking components of P9 and BPN, and BB predominantly suppresses forward turning induced by P9. The diversity in these walk–halt interactions suggests that the neural targets and mechanisms deployed by the three halting pathways are at least partially distinct. The walk-OFF mechanism, guided by the whole fly brain connectome and the FlyWire toolkit, led us to ask if and where the halting and walking pathways might converge."
2383,"We identified, annotated, and proofread all the walk and halt neuronal types and their downstream partners in the connectome. We found no direct connections between the walk and halt neurons. However, all the walk and halt neurons share a common output zone, the SEZ, where they could converge on the same output neurons."
2384,"Even though MDN and P9 are descending neurons that project from the brain to the VNC, they have collaterals in the SEZ through which they recruit other neurons, including DNs. Decapitated MDN flies, in which these SEZ collaterals are eliminated, show backward walking on optogenetic stimulation, indicating that the VNC circuit recruited by MDNs is sufficient for driving the phenotype. However, decapitated P9-activated flies do not show the phenotypic forward turning."
2385,"This implies that the other DNs recruited by P9 SEZ collaterals are critical for the phenotype. Indeed, some P9 downstream DNs were previously implicated in turning. BPN is a higher brain neuron that directly recruits other DNs through SEZ outputs."
2386,"We therefore focused on identifying whether halting pathway projections to the SEZ impinge on DNs recruited by P9 and BPN. To comprehensively analyze the interaction between halting and walking pathways, we used a connectome-constrained whole-brain spiking network model to reproduce the behavioral coactivation experiments in silico. The model uses the entire connectivity matrix from the FlyWire data and assigns positive or negative weight to the connection based on synapse number and predicted neurotransmitter."
2387,"We validated the neurotransmitter predictions for the halt neurons and confirmed that FG and BB are γ-aminobutyric acidergic neurons, whereas BRK is an excitatory neuronal type. Comparing responses across the top 100 responding neurons in each in silico coactivation experiment shows that all three halt neurons inhibit different, partially overlapping subsets of neurons recruited by the walk pathways. Although the P9 pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by BB, the BPN pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by FG."
2388,"This aligns with the corresponding behavioral phenotypes. We next focused on DNs strongly recruited by the walk pathways and generated synapse-weighted graphs to simultaneously visualize the connectivity and predicted firing rate. In the case of P9 coactivation with halt neurons, BB suppressed the firing rate of most of the DNs, whereas FG specifically inhibited a single DN named oDN1."
2389,"The BB result is consistent with the complete suppression of the P9 phenotype in behavioral experiments. Given that FG only suppressed the forward walking component of the P9 phenotype, we infer that oDN1 is mainly relevant for driving forward velocity but not rotational velocity. In the case of DNs recruited by BPN, neither FG nor BB inhibits the whole population."
2390,"This could explain why we never saw a complete suppression of walking in the corresponding behavioral experiments. To probe why FG has a stronger effect in behavioral experiments, we compared the neurons that are differentially affected by FG versus BB. BDN2 stood apart as a DN specifically and strongly inhibited by FG."
2391,"Taken together, the modeling and behavioral data show that FG and BB are positioned to directly inhibit critical nodes in the P9 and BPN walking-promotion pathways and decrease forward and/or rotational walking velocity. We term this the walk-OFF mechanism. Furthermore, oDN1 and BDN2 stood apart as important nodes to mediate differences in BB and FG effects on the walking pathways."
2392,"We therefore generated split-Gal4 drivers to specifically target these neurons. Optogenetically activating oDN1 and BDN2 drove walking initiation, with BDN2 showing a much stronger phenotype. Even decapitated oDN1 and BDN2 activated flies initiated robust forward walking, suggesting that, unlike P9, the VNC outputs of these DNs are sufficient for forward walking."
2393,"However, on optogenetic silencing, only BDN2-silenced flies showed a reduction in forward velocity. This suggests that BDN2 might be critical during spontaneous walking, whereas oDN1 could be redundant or recruited only in specific contexts. Indeed, on in vivo imaging, we found that BDN2 activity is strongly correlated to the forward velocity of the fly."
2394,"Given that BDN2 is strongly inhibited by FG and not by BB, this could explain why FG drives stronger halting in spontaneously walking flies. In silico coactivating BRK ascending projections, along with P9 and BPN, showed that while BRK is excitatory, it recruits other predicted inhibitory neurons in the SEZ to suppress walking-promotion DNs. When coactivated with P9, BRK inhibits many of the critical walking-promotion DNs, including oDN1."
2395,"However, when coactivated with BPN, BRK inhibits only a subset of DNs, with BDN2 being weakly inhibited. This is in contrast to the strong walking suppression observed in the corresponding behavioral experiments. Crucially, BRK activation suppressed backward walking driven by MDN, whose descending output in the VNC is sufficient to drive backward walking."
2396,"This suggests that, in addition to inhibiting some walking-promoting pathways in the brain, BRK probably acts in the VNC to drive halting. The ""brake"" mechanism: The stepping cycle consists of a swing phase and stance phase. Given the strong ""freezing-like"" BRK phenotype, we wondered whether BRK could cause the legs to ""freeze"" at any point during a stepping cycle, similar to a recent report in mice."
2397,"We found that in the case of BRK mid-swing stimulation, the leg finishes the swing phase in an unaltered manner but freezes as soon as it lands on the ground when the femur-tibia joint is in an extended position. Indeed, in these cases, swing duration is not altered when compared to prestimulus swing duration. However, for BRK mid-stance stimulation, the leg stays locked in place at the onset of the stimulation, leading to a broad Fe-Ti joint distribution across flies and trials."
2398,"This is in contrast to FG stimulation, in which the leg always assumes a relaxed stance position, regardless of when the optogenetic stimulus started. A similar result was obtained for other leg joints, suggesting it is not a Fe–Ti joint-specific phenomenon. This locking of joints during the stance phase shows that the BRK phenotype is probably due to an active mechanism."
2399,"We proposed that this could be driven by BRK VNC outputs upregulating the postural resistance reflex to lock the leg joints. The term “resistance reflex” is used to describe postural reflexes in all legged animals that allow maintenance of posture while in a stationary state. Upregulating such reflexes could lead to the locking of leg joints during the stance phase, as seen with BRK stimulation."
2400,"To test this hypothesis, we activated either MDN or MDN + BRK in decapitated flies and analyzed their leg kinematics. As reported earlier, decapitated flies showed backward walking on MDN activation. However, decapitated MDN + BRK stimulated flies remained stationary."
2401,"This confirms that a VNC-specific circuit is recruited by BRK to arrest leg movements. During backward walking, the Fe–Ti joint of the front leg is extended before a swing is initiated. We therefore refer to Fe–Ti angles above 107° as the “swing initiation zone.”"
2402,"On MDN + BRK stimulation, the Fe–Ti angle remained locked in place, and in most cases, never reached the SIZ. In the few cases when it did reach the SIZ, this rarely led to levation of the leg. The leg, despite being in an extended Fe–Ti position, still remained firmly perched on the substrate, as indicated by increased dwell time in the SIZ and decreased swing events in the SIZ."
2403,"We performed a complementary analysis for forward walking while activating BDN2 or BDN2 + BRK in decapitated flies. In contrast to backward walking, during forward walking, the SIZ for front-leg Fe–Ti lies in flexed angle values. Despite this difference, coactivation with BRK interrupted forward walking in a similar manner to that seen for backward walking."
2404,"Taken together, this showed that BRK activation led the flies to resist both flexion and extension at the Fe–Ti joint. Resisting such movements would require actively engaging specific leg muscles. We therefore activated BRK and monitored front-leg femoral muscle activity with the Fe–Ti joint restrained in a flexed or extended position."
2405,"In a flexed Fe–Ti position, activating BRK recruited accessory flexor-a and extensor. However, in an extended Fe–Ti position, BRK stimulation recruited accessory flexor-a and accessory flexor-b. Based on the literature, we inferred that accessory flexor-a corresponds to the muscles innervated by slow motor neurons and is also implicated in maintaining joint position."
2406,"The position of accessory flexor-b indicates they are probably innervated by intermediate and/or fast flexor motor neurons that drive flexion movement, which would resist forced extension. Extensors, on the other hand, drive Fe–Ti extension and would therefore resist forced flexion. Thus, the muscle activity profile driven by BRK resembles a resistance-like state in each Fe–Ti position."
2407,"Even in cases when there was spontaneous, prestimulus muscle activity, BRK drove a concerted change, including inhibition of highly active muscles and activation of specific muscles to reach this same resistance state-like activity profile. To confirm this represents a resistance reflex-like activity, we passively flexed or extended the Fe–Ti joint and induced a resistance reflex while monitoring muscle activity. Here, both control flies and BRK stimulated flies resisted these passive movements and showed similar recruitment of muscles to that described above, with BRK stimulated flies showing a more robust response."
2408,"Taken together, this suggests that BRK drives a resistance-like state in the femoral muscles. FG or BB activation did not induce any robust muscle activity in similar experiments. Only in cases where there was prestimulus spontaneous muscle activity did FG lead to gradual inhibition of this activity."
2409,"We reasoned this could be because FG inhibits DNs driving the prestimulus spontaneous activity. Combining the kinematics and muscle-imaging results, we conclude that BRK drives a stance phase-specific resistance state at the leg joints by means of a VNC-specific neural circuit. FG and BB are required during foraging. We next addressed if and when the animals use the FG, BB, and BRK halting pathways."
2410,"Mining the connectome for inputs to the halting neurons revealed that FG and BB are downstream to the sugar sensory pathway and directly connected to Fdg neurons previously shown to drive halting and proboscis extension for feeding. We therefore activated sugar gustatory receptor neurons both in silico and in vivo. In both cases, FG was strongly recruited, whereas BB showed weak and variable activity."
2411,"Moreover, in vivo, FG showed stronger responses in starved flies compared to fed flies, whereas BB only responded in starved flies. These state-dependent responses could be driven by differences in the feeding drive due to hunger signals impinging on the sugar sensory pathway."
2412,"To understand how different feeding and walking drives might converge on the previously implicated walking-promotion nodes, we coactivated sugar GRNs with either P9 or BPN walk neurons at varying activity levels and monitored oDN1 and BDN2 firing rates, respectively. Both oDN1 and BDN2 were tightly regulated as a function of walking and feeding pathway stimulation, showing that there is an excitation–inhibition balance at these nodes. To test whether FG is critical for relaying the inhibition from sugar GRNs to the walking nodes, we repeated the above simulation, but silenced FG in the model."
2413,"This clearly shifted the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking nodes, such that we could now see a release of inhibition on oDN1 and BDN2 when compared to the results in the FG intact model. This suggests that FG may be relevant for halting in the context of foraging and feeding. Because BB is only weakly recruited in our model, we did not see significant changes at BDN2 or oDN1 when we repeated the simulation with BB silenced."
2414,"To confirm the role of halt neurons during feeding, we optogenetically silenced these neurons while providing starved flies with a choice between blank substrate versus sucrose substrate. Control flies or flies with BRK or BB silenced spent most of their time on the sucrose side, whereas FG silenced flies were unable to preferentially stay on the sucrose side, confirming the importance of FG for stopping upon sugar detection. At the start of this assay, flies were randomly distributed on the sucrose and blank side, making it difficult to analyze locomotor changes when the fly first encountered the sucrose."
2415,"To analyze these first encounters, we quantified the interaction of flies with a small food blob, placed at the center of a large circular arena. All flies slowed down when they first encountered the food blob, probably because, unlike the previous assay, here they could detect the food blob by textural changes and consume it. However, FG- and BB-silenced flies showed shorter stopping bouts and increased velocities near the blob compared to controls."
2416,"Specifically, BB-silenced flies were indistinguishable from controls before the food encounter but showed a prolonged increase in both translational and angular velocities after the food encounter. This could indicate a potential role for BB in constraining forward and angular velocities during foraging-type behaviors that involve a local search following a food encounter. Such post-food-encounter behavioral state transitions have been well described in flies."
2417,"However, these are not accounted for in our computational model or in the functional imaging experiments. This could explain the weaker BB responses observed during in vivo or in silico sugar-GRN stimulation. Taken together, this confirms that FG and BB are recruited for halting and locomotor control in the context of feeding and foraging."
2418,"Notably, connectomics revealed that this halting pathway diverges from the previously described proboscis extension pathway. In agreement with this, FG or BB silencing had no effect on the proboscis extension response when tethered flies were presented with sucrose. BRK is required during grooming. To understand when flies recruit BRK neurons, we monitored in vivo BRK activity in spontaneous walking and halting flies."
2419,"We imaged a region of the VNC that permits identification of the axons belonging to each of the six BRK neurons. We noticed that BRK is recruited only during a subset of halting events. By annotating synchronously recorded behavior, we found that BRK activity correlated with either “ball-pushing” or “grooming” events."
2420,"As ball-pushing is probably a special behavior that only happens in a tethered fly walking on an air-supported ball, we focused on the grooming events. BRK activity correlated in a segment-specific manner to the respective grooming events. Most prominent among these were front-leg rubs and hind-leg rubs that coincided with large correlated activity bumps in front and hind BRK, respectively."
2421,"Aligning the BRK activity profile across multiple flies and grooming events showed that the segment-specific BRK activity starts ramping up before the grooming event and synchronizes with a coincident dip in walking velocity. Fittingly, in the connectome, we found that DNg12, a command neuron that drives head grooming with front legs, provides most input to front BRK, whereas wPN1, a command neuron that drives wing grooming with hind legs, provides most input to hind BRK. We also identified potential leg-grooming sensory-motor pathways from each leg to corresponding segment BRK neurons."
2422,"Thus, BRK neurons receive distinct segment-specific grooming command inputs. However, all BRK neurons share common outputs that lead to halting with upregulation of postural reflexes. What could be the role of the BRK outputs during grooming?"
2423,"During grooming, flies halt and lift a subset of legs while supporting their body weight on the remaining stationary legs. We wondered whether BRK was necessary for both halting and stability during grooming. We therefore optogenetically silenced BRK in flies that were induced to groom by powdering them."
2424,"BRK silencing did not abolish grooming but led to the interruption of continuous grooming by intermittent walking events, confirming BRK’s role in halting during grooming. Control flies or flies with FG or BB silenced showed prolonged uninterrupted grooming. Moreover, we found that BRK-silenced flies became destabilized during grooming."
2425,"To address whether this destabilization was due to the VNC outputs of BRK, we repeated this experiment in decapitated flies. Consistent with the literature, control decapitated flies showed robust grooming when covered with powder. Because decapitated flies do not have an inherent forward walking drive like intact flies, it was unsurprising that we did not see any walking in BRK-silenced flies."
2426,"However, we saw that powdered, decapitated BRK-silenced flies often lost their balance and tripped while grooming, confirming BRK’s role in stabilization during grooming. Based on the above observations, and given that BRK output only affects legs in stance, we proposed that BRK is recruited by segment-specific grooming commands to halt and stabilize the posture of the stationary legs used for balancing the body weight. For instance, during front grooming, command neurons would recruit the front BRKs that in turn stabilize mid and hind legs, whereas during hind grooming, the corresponding grooming commands would recruit hind BRKs that in turn stabilize the front and mid legs."
2427,"To test this segment-specific role of BRK, we designed an assay in which we silenced BRK subsets while inducing segment-specific grooming. We generated split-Gal4 lines that targeted front BRK, front + mid-BRK, or front + hind BRK, and confirmed that activating these BRK subsets drives halting in all cases. Next, we optogenetically silenced these BRK subsets and induced front or hind grooming using a powdered brush in tethered decapitated flies placed on an air-supported ball."
2428,"We performed a leg kinematics analysis of the front and hind legs. As expected, control flies were stable during the grooming events, as indicated by low ball movement and low Fe–Ti movement of the non-grooming legs. Conversely, when front-BRK silenced flies were induced to perform front grooming, they were destabilized, as shown by increased ball movement and hind-leg movements."
2429,"However, if flies with silenced front BRK but intact hind BRK were induced to perform hind grooming, they showed control-like behavior and groomed their hind legs while stabilizing their front legs. On the other hand, flies with hind BRK silenced were destabilized during hind grooming bouts. Taken together, this shows that BRK is recruited in a segment-specific manner for halting and stability in the context of grooming."
2430,"We thus explain distinct contexts in which each halting pathway is recruited. Consistent with this, activating head-bristle sensory projections in the brain connectome model drove strong activity in DNg12s but not in FG or BB, whereas activating sugar GRNs recruited FG and BB but not DNg12s. Having identified the critical nodes in the walking pathways that are targeted by halt neurons, we aimed to gain insight into other halting pathways that could be relevant in other contexts."
2431,"Although we could not identify some previously described slowing or halting neurons in the connectome, we could locate two neurons that were implicated indirectly in promoting halting, namely MAN and oviDN. In similar simulations as in Fig. 3, both MAN and oviDN, through predicted GABAergic neurons, suppressed walking-promotion neurons, including oDN1 and BDN2."
2432,"This showed other routes in addition to FG, BB, and BRK that could inhibit walking-promotion nodes. To find all such routes, we generated a list of predicted halt neurons as those with strong inhibitory inputs to oDN1 and BDN2, most of which also inhibit other potential walking-promotion DNs. As these neurons will ultimately control the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking-promotion nodes, they could also be involved in velocity control and not just halting."
2433,"These predicted halt neurons receive input from different upstream neurons and could underlie halting in other behavioral contexts. Our work explains two fundamental halting mechanisms in Drosophila. The first mechanism, categorized as the walk-OFF mechanism, causes halting by inhibition of walking-promotion neurons."
2434,"This could be compared to taking one’s foot off the gas pedal of a car and is analogous to action-suppression mechanisms proposed in different behaviors, including walking, across organisms. In this connectomics-driven work, we could go beyond identification of this mechanism and gain major insights into the organization of the halting and walking-control circuits in flies. We found that walking initiation neurons recruit populations of heterogeneous DNs by means of SEZ outputs that are poised to recruit multiple downstream VNC circuits for initiating specific walking patterns. Halting and walking pathways converge at specific nodes in these DN populations, whose excitation–inhibition balance probably dictates the walking state, and different halting pathways inhibit different subsets of walking-promotion DNs."
2435,"Specifically, turning and forward-walking-promoting DNs could be differentially inhibited by BB and FG, respectively. This shows a modularity in the descending control of turning and forward walking that is consistent with recent results from neuronal population imaging and modeling work in Drosophila. This also aligns with modularity at the level of brainstem spinal projection neurons observed in vertebrates, indicating that vertebrates could also have halting pathways that differentially inhibit forward locomotion and turning."
2436,"The second mechanism, categorized as the brake mechanism, drives active resistance at the leg joints in the legs that are on the ground, much like the brakes of a car resisting the motion of the wheels. Also, similarly to how one releases the accelerator pedal while pressing on the brakes to avoid skidding, the newly identified BRK neurons inhibit the walking-promotion DNs through their brain outputs while simultaneously promoting resistance in the legs through their VNC outputs. The pathway from BRK to leg muscles is probably gated by proprioceptive inputs that confer the stance phase-specific behavioral response."
2437,This BRK mechanism is consistent with their recruitment during grooming when the fly needs to both inhibit walking and balance its body on a subset of stationary legs. A similar mechanism could be relevant in other halting contexts in flies or other animals for the execution of halting with increased stability. Recent work in mice has uncovered a brainstem neuronal population that drives halting with legs in stance.
2438,"However, these neurons were not shown to drive the upregulation of postural reflexes as seen for BRK. Moreover, recent work shows subsets of Chx10-Gi neurons being relevant in different aspects of walking, stopping, turning, or grooming. Our results encourage the search for a BRK-like mechanism in these Chx10-Gi subsets or other BRK-analogous spinal ascending pathways in vertebrates."
2439,"Comparing across connectome-informed circuits of all verified or predicted halting pathways in this study, we isolated a generic neural circuit motif for halting. To promote halting to allow stationary behaviors such as feeding, egg-laying, or grooming, the halting pathway branches off from the behavior-specific sensory-motor pathway and impinges on walking-promoting circuits. The halt neurons themselves need not encode for the behavior-specific motor output but rather drive the initiation and maintenance of a halted state during the behavior."
2440,"This halting branch is typically located downstream of command-like neurons in the sensory-motor circuit. The emergence of modularity downstream in the circuit could be an efficient circuit design for targeting similar populations of walking-promotion neurons in different contexts. Despite this conserved motif shared across all halting pathways, the specific targets and mechanisms deployed by the halt neurons are distinct."
2441,"This distinction may confer specificity on how halting versus walking decisions are executed in a context-appropriate manner. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, largely due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic, and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types, and developmental units."
2442,"Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes."
2443,"Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and an open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics. The adult fruit fly represents the current frontier for whole-brain connectomics."
2444,"With 139,255 neurons, the newly completed full adult female brain connectome is intermediate in log scale between the first connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse, a desirable but currently intractable target. The availability of a complete adult fly brain connectome now allows brain-spanning circuits to be mapped and linked to circuit dynamics and behavior as has long been possible for the nematode and, more recently, the Drosophila larva. However, the adult fly has richer behavior, including complex motor control while walking or in flight, courtship behavior, involved decision-making, flexible associative memory, spatial learning, and complex multisensory navigation."
2445,"The FlyWire brain connectome reported in our companion paper is by some margin the largest and most complex yet obtained. The full connectome, derived from the approximately 100 teravoxel FAFB whole-brain electron microscopy volume, can be represented as a graph with 139,255 nodes and around 15.1 million weighted edges."
2446,"Here we formulate and answer key questions that are essential to interpreting connectomes at this scale regarding how we know which edges are important; how we can simplify the connectome graph to aid automated or human analysis; and the extent to which this connectome is a snapshot of a single brain or representative of this species as a whole. These questions are inextricably linked with connectome annotation and cell type identification within and across datasets. At the most basic level, navigating this connectome would be extremely challenging without a comprehensive system of annotations, which we now provide."
2447,"Our annotations represent an indexed and hierarchical human-readable parts list, enabling biologists to explore their systems and neurons of interest. Connectome annotation is also crucial to ensuring data quality as it inevitably reveals segmentation errors that must be corrected. Furthermore, there is a rich history in Drosophila of probing the circuit basis of a wide range of innate and learned behaviors, as well as their developmental genetic origins; realizing the full potential of this dataset is only possible by cross-identifying cell types within the connectome with those characterized in the published and in-progress literature."
2448,"This paper reports this key component of the connectome together with the open-source tools and resources that we have generated. As the annotation and proofreading of the connectome are inextricably linked, the companion paper and this paper will preferably be co-cited, as they jointly describe the FlyWire resource. Comparison with cell types proposed using the partial hemibrain connectome confirmed that the majority of fly cell types are highly stereotyped and defined simple rules for which connections within a connectome are reliable and therefore more likely to be functional."
2449,"However, this comparison also revealed unexpected variability in some cell types and demonstrated that many cell types originally reported in the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. This discovery necessitated the development and application of a new robust approach for defining cell types jointly across connectomics datasets. Overall, this effort lays the foundation both for deep interrogation of current and anticipated fly connectomes from normal individuals, as well as for future studies of sexual dimorphism, experience-dependent plasticity, development, and disease at the whole-brain scale."
2450,"Hierarchical annotation of a connectome: Annotations defining different kinds of neurons are key to exploring and interpreting any connectome; but, with the FlyWire connectome—which we report jointly with the companion paper—now exceeding the 100,000 neuron mark, they are both of increased significance and more challenging to generate. We defined a comprehensive, systematic, and hierarchical set of annotations based on the anatomical organization of the brain, as well as the developmental origin and coarse morphology of neurons. Building on these, as well as validating cell types identified from pre-existing datasets, we then defined a set of consensus terminal cell types intended to capture the finest level of organization that is reproducible across brains."
2451,"We first collected and curated basic metadata for every neuron in the dataset, including soma position and side and entry or exit nerve for afferent and efferent neurons, respectively. Our group also predicted neurotransmitter identity for all neurons as reported elsewhere. We then defined a hierarchy of four levels: flow > superclass > class > cell type, which provide salient labels at different granularities."
2452,"The first two levels, flow and superclass, were densely annotated: every neuron is either afferent, efferent, or intrinsic to the brain and falls into one of the nine superclasses: sensory, motor, endocrine, ascending, descending, visual projection, visual centrifugal, or intrinsic to the optic lobes or the central brain. Mapping to the database enables cross-referencing of neurons and types with other publications."
2453,"Note that due to an inversion of the left–right axis during the original acquisition of the dataset, identified during the preparation of this work, frontal figures in this work and the FlyWire connectome have the fly’s left on the viewer’s left and the fly’s right on the viewer’s right, that is, the opposite of the usual convention. However, all side labels are biologically correct. The class field contains pre-existing neurobiological groupings from the literature and is sparsely annotated for the central brain, in large part because past research has favored some brain areas over others."
2454,"In the optic lobes, 99% of neurons have a generic class based on their neuropil innervation. Finally, 98% of all central brain neurons were given a terminal cell type, the majority of which could be linked to at least one report in the literature. Our annotations for the optic lobes include cell types for 92% of neurons in both the left and right optic lobes."
2455,"A separate report will describe the comprehensive typing of all neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes. In total, we collected over 870,000 annotations for all 139,255 neurons; all are available for download and through neuroglancer scenes. A total of 32,388 neurons are intrinsic to the central brain, and 77,536 neurons are intrinsic to the optic lobes."
2456,"The optic lobes and the central brain are connected through 8,053 visual projection and 524 visual centrifugal neurons. The central brain receives afferent input through 5,512 sensory and 2,362 ascending neurons. Efferent output is realized through 1,303 descending, 80 endocrine, and 106 motor neurons."
2457,"We find marked stereotypy in the number of central brain intrinsic neurons—for example, between the left and the right hemisphere, they differ by only 27 neurons. For superclasses with less consistency in left versus right counts, such as the ascending neurons, the discrepancies are typically due to ambiguity in the sidedness. Combining the dense superclass annotation for all neurons with the connectome gives a bird’s-eye view of the input/output connectivity of the central brain: 55% of the central brain’s synaptic input comes from the optic system, 25% from the VNC through ascending neurons, and only 18% from peripheral sensory neurons."
2458,"This is surprising as sensory neurons are almost as numerous as visual projection neurons; individual visual projection neurons therefore provide about 2.5 times more synapses, underscoring the value of this information stream. Input neurons make about two synapses onto central brain neurons for every one synapse onto output neurons."
2459,"Most output synapses target the VNC through descending neurons; the rest provide centrifugal feedback onto the optic system, motor neuron output, and endocrine output to the periphery. Our top-level annotations provide a systematic but relatively coarse grouping of neurons compared with over 5,000 terminal cell types expected from previous work on the hemibrain. We therefore developed an intermediate level of annotation based on hemilineages—this provides a powerful bridge between the developmental origin and molecular specification of neurons and their place within circuits in the connectome."
2460,"Central brain neurons and a minority of visual projection neurons are generated by around 120 identified neuroblasts per hemisphere. Each of these stem cells is defined by a unique transcriptional code and generates a stereotyped lineage in a precise birth order by asymmetric division. Each neuroblast typically produces two hemilineages that differ markedly in neuronal morphology and can express different neurotransmitters from one another, but neurons in each hemilineage usually express a single fast-acting transmitter."
2461,"Hemilineages therefore represent a natural functional as well as developmental grouping by which to study the nervous system. Within a hemilineage, neurons form processes that extend together in one cohesive bundle that enters, traverses, and interconnects neuropil compartments in a stereotypical pattern. Comparing these features between EM and previous light-level data enabled us to compile the first definitive atlas of all hemilineages in the central brain."
2462,"In total, we successfully identified 120 neuroblast lineages in FlyWire comprising 183 hemilineages for 88% of central brain neurons. The unassigned neurons are likely primary neurons born during embryonic development, which account for 10% of neurons in the adult brain. We tentatively designated 3,779 as primary neurons either based on specific identification in the literature or expert assessment of diagnostic morphological features such as larger cell bodies and broader projections."
2463,"A further 797 neurons did not co-fasciculate with any hemilineage tracts, even though their morphology suggested that they are later-born secondary neurons. This developmental atlas is comprehensive, as, after reviewing discrepancies between previous studies, we identified all 119 expected lineages plus one new lineage. The number of neurons per hemilineage can vary widely—for example, counting both hemispheres, FLAa1 contains just 30 neurons, whereas MBp4 has 1,335."
2464,"However, in general, the number of neurons per hemilineage is between 60 and 282. Nevertheless, the numbers of neurons within each hemilineage were highly reliable, differing only by 3% between the left and right hemispheres. This is consistent with the near-equality of neurons per hemisphere noted in a previous figure and indicates great precision in the developmental programs controlling neuron number. We also identified neurons belonging to 125 hemilineages in the hemibrain dataset, a connectome comprising approximately half of a female fly brain. The number of neurons per hemilineage strongly correlates across brains, with FlyWire hemilineages containing on average around 5% more neurons."
2465,"Although hemilineages typically contain functionally and morphologically related neurons, subgroups can be observed. We further divided each hemilineage into distinct morphology groups, each innervating similar brain regions and taking similar internal tracts, using NBLAST morphological clustering. This generated a total of 528 groupings that are consistent across hemispheres and provide an additional layer of annotations between the hemilineage and cell type levels."
2466,"Validating cell types across brains, we next sought to compare FlyWire against the hemibrain connectome; this contains most of one central brain hemisphere and parts of the optic lobe. The hemibrain was previously densely cell typed by a combination of two automated procedures followed by extensive manual review: NBLAST morphology clustering initially yielded 5,235 morphology types; multiple rounds of CBLAST connectivity clustering split some types, generating 640 connectivity types for a final total of 5,620 types. We have reidentified just 14% of connectivity types and therefore use the 5,235 morphology types as a baseline for comparison."
2467,"Although 389 of the hemibrain cell types were previously established in the literature and recorded in the database, principally through the analysis of genetic driver lines, the great majority were newly proposed using the hemibrain, that is, derived from a single hemisphere of a single animal. This was reasonable given the pioneering nature of the hemibrain reconstruction, but the availability of the FlyWire connectome now allows for a more stringent re-examination."
2468,"We approach this by considering each cell type in the hemibrain as a prediction: if we can reidentify a distinct group of cells with the same properties in both hemispheres of the FlyWire dataset, then we conclude that a proposed hemibrain cell type has been tested and validated. To perform this validation, we first used non-rigid three-dimensional registration to map meshes and skeletons of all hemibrain neurons into FlyWire space, enabling direct co-visualization of both datasets and a range of automated analyses. We then used NBLAST to calculate morphological similarity scores between all hemibrain neurons and the approximately 84,000 FlyWire neurons with arbors at least partially contained within the hemibrain volume."
2469,"We manually reviewed the top five NBLAST hits for a random sample of individual neuron-to-neuron matches and found that high NBLAST scores typically indicate a good morphological match. Extrapolating from this sample, we expect 99% of hemibrain neurons to have a morphologically very similar neuron in FlyWire. We next attempted to map hemibrain cell types onto FlyWire neurons."
2470,"Candidate type matches were manually reviewed by co-visualization, and only those with high confidence were accepted. Crucially, this initial morphological matching process generated a large corpus of shared cell type labels between datasets; with these in place, we developed an across-dataset connectivity clustering method that enabled us to investigate and resolve difficult cases. The majority of hemibrain cell types were unambiguously found in the FlyWire dataset."
2471,"A further 664 hemibrain types were mapped but had to be either merged or further split. In total, 7% of proposed hemibrain types were combined to define new “composite” types because the hemibrain split could not be recapitulated when examining neurons from both FlyWire and the hemibrain. This is not too surprising as the hemibrain philosophy was explicitly to err on the side of splitting in cases of uncertainty."
2472,"We found that 5% of proposed hemibrain types needed to be split, for example, because truncation of neurons in the hemibrain removed a key defining feature. Together, these revisions mean that the 3,584 reidentified hemibrain cell types map onto 3,643 consensus cell types. All revisions were confirmed by across-dataset connectivity clustering."
2473,"Notably, 1,651 hemibrain cell types could not be reidentified in FlyWire. Ambiguities due to hemibrain truncation can partially explain this: we were much more successful at matching neurons that were not truncated in the hemibrain. However, this appears not to be the main explanation."
2474,"Especially in cases of multiple, very similar, “adjacent” hemibrain types, we often encountered “chains” of ambiguity that made assigning types difficult. Further investigation suggests that the majority of these unmatched hemibrain types are not exactly replicable across animals. Instead, we show that multiconnectome analysis can generate validated cell types that are robust to interindividual variation."
2475,"In conclusion, we validated 3,643 high-confidence consensus cell type labels for 43,737 neurons from three different hemispheres and two different brains. Collectively, these cross-matched neurons cover 46.5% of central brain edges in the FlyWire graph."
2476,"This body of high-confidence cross-identified neurons enables both within-brain and across-brain comparisons. Cell types are highly stereotyped. Using the consensus cell type labels, we found that the numbers of cells per type across the three hemispheres are closely correlated. About one in six cell types shows a difference in numbers between the left and right hemisphere, and one in three across brains."
2477,"The mean difference in the number of cells per type is small, though: 0.3 within brains and 0.8 across brains."
2478,"Importantly, cell types with fewer neurons per type are less variable. At the extreme, ""singleton"" cell types account for 59% of all types in our sample; they often appear to be embryonically born or early secondary neurons, and only very rarely comprise more than one neuron—only 3% of neurons that are singletons in both FlyWire hemispheres have more than one member in the hemibrain. By contrast, more numerous cell types are also more likely to vary in number both within and even more so across brains."
2479,"Synapse counts were also largely consistent within cell types, both within and across brains. To enable a fair comparison, the FlyWire synapse cloud was restricted to the smaller hemibrain volume. Although this does not correct for other potential confounds such as differences in synaptic completion rates or synapse detection, pre- and post-synapse counts per cell type were highly correlated, both within brains and across brains."
2480,"This is an important quality control and prerequisite for subsequent connectivity comparisons. The fly brain is mostly left–right symmetric, but inspection of the FlyWire dataset revealed a small number of asymmetries. For example, LC6 and LC9 visual projection neurons form a large axon bundle that follows the normal path in the right hemisphere, but in the left hemisphere, it loops over the mushroom body peduncle; nevertheless, the axons still find their correct targets as previously reported."
2481,"We annotated other examples of this, ranging from small additional/missing branches to misguided neurite bundles, and found that only 0.4% of central brain neurons exhibit such biological oddities. Brain wiring develops through a complex and probabilistic developmental process."
2482,"To interpret the connectome, it is vital to obtain a basic understanding of how variable that biological process is. This is complicated by the fact that the connectome we observe is shaped not just by biological variability but also by technical noise, for example, from segmentation issues, synapse detection errors, and synaptic completion rates. Here we use the consensus cell types to assess which connections are reliably observed across three hemispheres of connectome data."
2483,"We use the term ""edge"" to describe the set of connections between two cell types, and its ""weight"" as the number of unitary synapses forming that connection. Weights of individual edges are highly correlated within and across brains. Consistent with this, cell types exhibit highly similar connectivity within as well as across brains."
2484,"While the connectivity similarity across brains is lower than within brains, the effect size is small and is at least in part due to the aforementioned truncation in the hemibrain. We next examined, for a given edge between two cell types in one hemisphere, the odds of finding the same connection in another hemisphere or brain. Examination of 572,980 edges present in at least one of the three brain hemispheres showed that 53% of the edges observed in the hemibrain were also found in FlyWire."
2485,"This fraction is slightly higher when comparing between the two FlyWire hemispheres: left to right: 61%; right to left: 59%. Weaker edges were less likely to be consistent: an edge consisting of a single synapse in the hemibrain has a 42% chance of also being present in a single FlyWire hemisphere, and only a 16% chance of being seen in both hemispheres of FlyWire. By contrast, any edge of more than ten synapses in any hemisphere can be reproducibly found in the other two hemispheres."
2486,"Although only 16% of all edges meet this threshold, they comprise around 79% of all synapses. We also analyzed normalized edge weights expressed as the fraction of the input onto each downstream neuron; this accounts for the small difference in synaptic completion rate between FlyWire and the hemibrain. With this treatment, the distributions are almost identical for within and across brain comparisons."
2487,"9% of the target cell type’s total inputs have a greater than 90% chance of persisting. Around 7% of edges, collectively containing over half of all synapses, meet this threshold. We observed that the fraction of edges persisting across datasets plateaued as the edge weight increased."
2488,"Using a level of 99% edge persistence, we can define a second principled heuristic: edges greater than 2.6% edge weight can be considered strong. Note that these statistics defined across the whole connectome can have exceptions in individual neurons."
2489,"For example, descending neuron DNp42 receives 34 synapses from PLP146 in FlyWire on the right, but none on the left or in the hemibrain; this may well be an example of developmental noise. So far, we have examined only the binary question of whether an edge exists or not. However, the conservation of edge weight is also highly relevant for interpreting connectomes."
2490,"We next considered that given an edge is present in two or more hemispheres, the odds are that it will have a similar weight. Edge weights within and across brains are highly correlated; a 30-synapse edge in the hemibrain, for example, will on average consist of 29 synapses in FlyWire, despite differences in synaptic detection and completion rates for these two datasets imaged with different EM modalities. The variance of edge weights is considerable, though: 25% of all 30-synapse hemibrain edges will consist of fewer than 13 synapses in FlyWire, and 5% will consist of only 1–2 synapses."
2491,"Consistency is greater when looking within FlyWire: a 30-synapse edge on the left will, on average, consist of 31 synapses on the right. Still, 25% of all 30-synapse edges on the left will consist of 21 synapses or less on the right, and 5% of only 1–8 synapses. To assess how much of this edge weight variability is biological and how much is technical, we modeled the impact of technical noise on a fictive ground truth connectome."
2492,"This model was randomly subsampled according to postsynaptic completion rate, and synapses were randomly added and deleted according to the false-positive and false-negative rates reported for synapse detection. Repeated application of this procedure generated a distribution of edge weights between each cell type pair expected due to technical noise alone. On average, 65% of the observed variability of edge weight between hemispheres fell within the range expected due to technical noise; this fraction approached 100% for weaker synapses."
2493,"For example, cell type LHCENT3 targets LHAV3g2 with 30 synapses on the left but only 23 on the right of FlyWire, which is within the 5–95% quantiles expected due to technical noise alone. Overall, this analysis shows that observed variability is greater than can be accounted for by technical noise, establishing a lower bound for likely biological variability and suggesting another simple heuristic: differences in edge weights of 30% or less may be entirely due to technical noise and should not be overinterpreted. Variability in the mushroom body. The comprehensive annotation of cell types in the FlyWire dataset revealed that the number of Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, is 30% larger per hemisphere than in the hemibrain, well above the average variation in cell counts."
2494,"While these KC counts are within the previously reported range, the difference presents an opportunity to investigate how connectomes accommodate perturbations in cell count. The mushroom body contains five principal cell classes: KCs, mushroom body output neurons, modulatory neurons, and octopaminergic neurons, as well as the dorsal paired medial and anterior paired lateral neuron giant interneurons. KCs further divide into five main cell types based on which parts of the mushroom body they innervate: KCab, KCab-p, KCg-m, KCa′b′, and KCg-d."
2495,"Of those, KCab, KCa′b′, and KCg-m are the primary recipients of largely random olfactory input through around 130 antennal lobe projection neurons comprising 58 canonical types. Global activity in the mushroom body is regulated through an inhibitory feedback loop mediated by APL, a single large GABAergic neuron. Analogous to the mammalian cerebellum, KCs transform the dense overlapping odour responses of the early olfactory system into sparse non-overlapping representations that enable the animal to discriminate between individual odours during associative learning."
2496,"The difference in cell counts is not evenly distributed across all KC types: KCg-m are almost twice as numerous in FlyWire compared to the hemibrain, while KCab and KCab-p are present in similar numbers. Protein starvation during the larval stage can induce specific increases in KCg-m number, suggesting that environmental variations in food resources may have contributed to this difference. To examine how this affects the mushroom body circuitry, we opted to compare the fraction of the input or output synaptic budget across different KCs, as this is well matched to our question and naturally handles a range of technical noise issues that seemed particularly prominent in the mushroom body completion rate."
2497,"We found that, despite the large difference in KCg-m cell counts between FlyWire and hemibrain, this cell type consistently makes and receives 32% and 45% of all KC pre-synapses and post-synapses, respectively. This suggests that individual FlyWire KCg-m neurons receive fewer inputs and make fewer outputs than their hemibrain counterparts. The share of ALPN outputs allocated to KCg-m is around 55% across all hemispheres, and the average ALPN to KCg-m connection is comparable in strength across hemispheres; however, each KCg-m neuron receives input from a much smaller number of ALPN types in FlyWire than in the hemibrain."
2498,"FlyWire KCg-m neurons therefore receive inputs with the same strength but from fewer ALPNs. This pattern holds for other KCg-m synaptic partners as well. Similar to the excitatory ALPNs, the share of APL outputs allocated to KCg-m neurons is essentially constant across hemispheres."
2499,"Thus, each individual KCg-m neuron receives proportionally less inhibition from the APL, as well as less excitation, maintaining a similar excitation/inhibition ratio. Furthermore, as a population, KCg-m neurons contribute similar amounts of input to MBONs. Past theoretical work has shown that the number of discrete odor channels providing input to each KC has an optimal value for maximizing the dimensionality of KC activity and, therefore, the discriminability of olfactory input."
2500,"The smaller value for K observed for KCg-m neurons in the FlyWire connectome raises the question of how dimensionality varies with K for each of the KC types. Using the neural network rate model described previously, we calculated dimensionality as a function of K for each of the KC types, using the observed KC counts, ALPN to KC connectivity, and global inhibition from the APL. This analysis revealed that optimal values for K are lower for KCg-m neurons in FlyWire than in the hemibrain, consistent with the observed values."
2501,"Taken together, these results demonstrate that, for KCg-m neurons, the brain compensates for a developmental perturbation by changing a single parameter: the number of odor channels each KC samples from. By contrast, KCa′b′ cells, which are also more numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain, appear to use a hybrid strategy of reduced K combined with a reduction in ALPN to KCa′b′ connection strength. These findings contradict earlier studies in which a global increase in KC numbers through genetic manipulation triggered an increase in ALPN axon boutons and a modest increase in KC claws."
2502,"This may be due to the differences in the nature and timing of the perturbation in KC cell number and the KC types affected. Toward multiconnectome cell typing, as the first dense, large-scale connectome of a fly brain, the hemibrain dataset proposed over 5,000 previously unknown cell types in addition to confirming around 400 previously reported types."
2503,"As this defines a de facto standard cell typing for large parts of the fly brain, our initial work plan was simply to reidentify hemibrain cell types in FlyWire, providing a critical resource for the fly neuroscience community. While this was successful for 68% of hemibrain cell types, 32% could not be validated. Given the great stereotypy generally exhibited by the fly nervous system, this result is both surprising and interesting."
2504,"We can imagine two basic categories of explanation. First, that through ever closer inspection, we may successfully reidentify these missing cell types. Second, that these definitions, mostly based on a single brain hemisphere, might not be robust to variation across individuals."
2505,"Distinguishing between these two explanations is not at all straightforward. We began by applying across-dataset connectivity clustering to large groups of unmatched hemibrain and FlyWire neurons. We observed that most remaining hemibrain types showed complex clustering patterns, which both separated neurons from the same proposed cell type and recombined neurons of different proposed hemibrain types."
2506,"While it is always more difficult to prove a negative result, these observations strongly suggest that the majority of the remaining 1,696 hemibrain types are not robust to interindividual variation. We therefore developed a definition of cell type that uses interanimal variability: a cell type is a group of neurons that are each more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other neuron in the same brain. This definition can be used with different similarity metrics, but for connectomics data, a similarity measure incorporating morphology and/or connectivity is most useful."
2507,"Our algorithmic implementation of this definition operates on the co-clustering dendrogram by finding the smallest possible clusters that satisfy two criteria: each cluster must contain neurons from all three hemispheres; within each cluster, the number of neurons from each hemisphere must be approximately equal. Determining how to cut a dendrogram generated by data clustering is a widespread challenge in data science for which there is no single satisfactory solution. A key advantage of the cell type definition that we propose is that it provides very strong guidance about how to assign neurons to clusters."
2508,"This follows naturally from the fact that connectome data provide us with all neurons in each dataset, rather than a random subsample. This advantage of completeness is familiar from analogous problems such as the ability to identify orthologous genes when whole genomes are available. Analysis of the hemibrain cell type AOTU063 provides a relatively straightforward example of our approach."
2509,"Morphology-based clustering generates a single group, comprising all six AOTU063 neurons from each of the three hemispheres. However, clustering based on connectivity reveals two discrete groups, with equal numbers of neurons from each hemisphere, suggesting that this type should be split further. Here, algorithmic analysis across multiple connectomes reveals consistent connectivity differences between subsets of AOTU063 neurons."
2510,"To test whether this approach is applicable to more challenging sets of neurons, we set aside the hemibrain types and performed a complete retyping of neurons in the central complex, a center for navigation in the insect brain that has been subject to detailed connectome analysis. We selected two large groups of neurons innervating the fan-shaped body that show a key difference in organization. The first group, FC1–3, consists of columnar cell types that tile the FB, innervating adjacent non-overlapping columns."
2511,"The second group, FB1–9, contains tangential neurons where neurons of the same cell type are precisely co-located in space. Standard NBLAST similarity assumes that neurons of the same cell type overlap closely in space; although this is true for most central brain types, it does not hold for repeated columnar neurons such as those in the optic lobe or these FC neurons of the FB. We therefore used a connectivity-only distance metric co-clustering across the three hemispheres."
2512,"This resulted in seven FC clusters satisfying the above criteria. Five of these cross-brain types have a one-to-one correspondence with hemibrain types, while two are merges of multiple hemibrain types; only a small number of neurons are recombined across types. For the second group, FB1–9, a combined morphology and connectivity embedding was used."
2513,"Co-clustering across the three hemispheres generated 114 cell types compared to 146 cell types in the hemibrain. In total, 44% of these types correspond one-to-one to a hemibrain cell type; 11% are splits, 12% are merges, and 33% are recombinations of hemibrain cell types. The 67% success rate of this de novo approach in identifying hemibrain cell types is slightly higher than the 61% achieved in our directed work; it is consistent with the notion that further effort could still identify some unmatched hemibrain types, but that the majority will probably require retyping. All of the preceding efforts have focused on cell typing neurons contained within both FlyWire and the hemibrain. We next examined the extensive regions of the brain covered only by FlyWire and not by hemibrain."
2514,"Based on the lessons learned from the joint analysis of hemibrain and FlyWire, we ran a co-clustering of neurons from the two hemispheres of FlyWire to fill in missing cell types. This combined both morphology and connectivity measures, was carried out separately for each hemilineage, and produced 3,200 new central brain cell types for a total of 8,453 including the optic lobes. We further compared double-hemisphere and triple-hemisphere analysis for 25 cross-identified lineages that are not truncated in the hemibrain."
2515,"This comparison found that 70% of these new types survive the addition of a third hemisphere with minor edits. That percentage increases to 84% if we exclude cases in which just one neuron changes clusters. In summary, cell typing based on joint analysis of multiple connectomes proved capable of recapitulating many cell types identified in the hemibrain dataset while also defining new candidate cell types that are consistent both within and across datasets."
2516,"Further validation of the new types proposed by this approach will depend on additional Drosophila connectomes, which are forthcoming. We predict that cell types defined in this manner will be substantially more robust than cell types defined from a single connectome alone. Discussion: Here we generated human-readable annotations for all neurons in the fly brain at various levels of granularity: superclass, cell class, hemilineage, morphology group, and cell type."
2517,"These annotations provide salient groupings that have already been proven to be useful not only in our own analyses but also in many of those in our companion paper as well as other publications in the FlyWire paper package introduced there and to researchers now using the online platforms Codex and FAFB-FlyWire CATMAID spaces. Hemilineage annotations also provide a key starting point to link the molecular basis of the development of the central brain to the wiring revealed by the connectome; such work has already begun in the more repetitive circuits of the optic lobe. The cell type atlas that we provide of 8,453 cell types, covering 96.4% of all neurons in the brain, is to our knowledge the largest ever proposed and, crucially, by some margin the largest ever validated collection of cell types. In C. elegans, the 118 cell types inferred from the original connectome have been clearly supported by analysis of subsequent connectomes and molecular data."
2518,"In a few cases in mammals, it has been possible to produce catalogues of around 100 cell types that have been validated by multimodal data, for example, in the retina or motor cortex. Although large-scale molecular atlases in the mouse produce highly informative hierarchies of up to 5,000 clusters, they do not yet try to define terminal cell types—the finest unit that is robust across individuals—with precision. Here we tested over 5,000 predicted cell types, resulting in 3,884 validated cell types using three hemispheres of connectome data."
2519,"Informed by this, we use the FlyWire dataset to propose an additional 3,685 cell types. Lessons for cell typing: Our experience of cell typing the FlyWire dataset, together with our earlier participation in the hemibrain cell typing effort, leads us to draw a number of lessons. First, we think that it is helpful to frame cell types generated in one dataset as predictions or hypotheses that can be tested either through additional connectome data or data from other modalities."
2520,"Related to this, although the two hemispheres of the same brain can be treated as two largely independent datasets, we do see evidence that variability can be correlated across hemispheres. We therefore recommend the use of three or more hemispheres to define and validate new cell types, both because of increased statistical confidence and because across-brain comparisons are a strong test of cell type robustness. Third, there is no free lunch in the classic lumping versus splitting debate."
2521,"The hemibrain cell typing effort preferred to split rather than lump cell types, reasoning that over-splitting could easily be remedied by merging cell types at a later date. Although this approach seemed reasonable at the time, it appears to have led to cell types being recombined: when using a single dataset, even domain experts may find it very hard to distinguish conserved differences between cell types from interindividual noise. Moreover, although some recent studies have argued that cell types are better defined by connectivity than morphology, we find that there is a place for both."
2522,"For de novo cell typing of future connectomes, we recommend an initial morphology-only matching to assign obvious matches; these shared cell type labels can then be used to define connection similarity across datasets. This allows extraction of balanced clusters from combined morphology and connectivity co-clustering that can be used to assign or refine existing cell types. Related to this, we find that across-dataset connection similarity is an extremely powerful way to identify cell types."
2523,"However, connectivity-based typing is typically used iteratively, and especially when used within a single dataset, this may lead to the selection of idiosyncratic features. Moreover, neurons can connect similarly but come from a different developmental lineage or express a different neurotransmitter, precluding them from sharing a cell type. Combining these two points, we would summarize that matching by morphology appears to be both more robust and sometimes less precise, whereas connectivity matching is a powerful tool that must be wielded with care."
2524,"In conclusion, connectome data are particularly suitable for cell typing: they are inherently multimodal, while the ability to see all cells within a brain is uniquely powerful. Our multiconnectome typing approach provides a robust and efficient way to use such data; cell types that have passed the rigorous test of across-connectome consistency are very unlikely to be revised. We suspect that connectome data will become the gold standard for cell typing."
2525,"Linking molecular and connectomic cell types will therefore be key. One promising new approach is exemplified by the prediction of neurotransmitter identity directly from EM images, but many others will be necessary. Finally, we address the three questions introduced in the introduction."
2526,"Can we simplify the connectome graph? Cell typing reduces the complexity of the connectome graph. This has important implications for analysis, modeling, experimental work, and developmental biology."
2527,"For example, we can reduce the 131,811 typed nodes in the raw connectome graph into a cell type graph with 8,453 nodes; the number of edges is similarly reduced. This should significantly aid human reasoning about the connectome. It will also make numerous network analyses possible as well as substantially reduce the degrees of freedom in brain-scale modeling."
2528,"It is important to note that, while collapsing multiple cells for a given cell type into a single node is often desirable, other use cases such as modeling studies may still need to retain each individual cell. However, if key parameters are determined on a per cell type basis, then the complexity of the resultant model can be much reduced. A recent study optimized and analyzed a highly successful model of large parts of the fly visual system with just 734 free parameters by using connectomic cell types."
2529,"For Drosophila experimentalists using the connectome, cell typing identifies groups of cells that probably form functional units. Most of these are linked to the published literature and in many cases to molecular reagents."
2530,"Others will be more easily identified for targeted labeling and manipulation after typing. Finally, cell typing effectively compresses the connectome, reducing the bits required to store and specify the graph. For a fly-sized connectome, this is no longer that important for computational analysis, but it may be important for brain development."
2531,"Some have argued that evolution has selected highly structured brain connectivity enabling animals to learn very rapidly, but that these wiring diagrams are far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome; rather, they must be compressed through a ""genomic bottleneck,"" which may itself have been a crucial part of evolving robust and efficient nervous systems. If we accept this argument, lossy compression based on aggregating nodes with similar cell type labels, approximately specifying strong edges, and largely ignoring weak edges would reduce the storage requirements by orders of magnitude and could be a specific implementation of this bottleneck."
2532,"The question of which of the 15.1 million edges in the connectome to pay attention to is critical for its interpretation. Intuitively, we assume that the more synapses that connect two neurons, the more important that connection must be."
2533,"There is some very limited evidence in support of this assumption correlating anatomical and functional connectivity. In lieu of physiological data, we postulate that edges that are critical to brain function should be consistently found across brains. By comparing connections between cell types identified in three hemispheres, we find that edges stronger than ten synapses or ≥0.9% of the target’s inputs have a greater than 90% chance to be preserved. This provides a simple heuristic for determining which edges are likely to be functionally relevant. It is also highly consistent with findings from the larval connectome, in which left–right asymmetries in connectivity vanish after removing edges weaker than 1."
2534,"25%. However, note that edges falling below the threshold might still significantly contribute to the brain’s function. We further address an issue that has received little attention: the impact of technical factors and biological variability on the final connectome and how to compensate for it."
2535,"In our hands, a model of technical noise could explain up to 30% difference in edge weights. While this model was made specifically for the two hemispheres of FlyWire, it highlights the general point that a firm understanding of all sources of variability will be vital for the young field of comparative connectomics to distinguish real and artificial differences. Have we collected a snowflake?"
2536,"The field of connectomics has long been criticized for unavoidably low sample sizes, raising the question of whether the brain of a single specimen is representative of all. For insects, there is a large body of evidence for morphological and functional stereotypy, although this information is available for only a minority of neurons, and much less is known about stereotyped connectivity. For vertebrate brains, the situation is less clear; it is generally assumed that subcortical regions will be more stereotyped, but the cortex also has conserved canonical microcircuits, and recent evidence has shown that some cortical elements can be genetically and functionally stereotyped."
2537,"Given how critical stereotypy is for connectomics, it is important to check whether that premise actually still holds true at the synaptic resolution. For the fly connectome, the answer to our question is actually both more nuanced and more interesting than we initially imagined. Based on conservation of edges between FlyWire and hemibrain hemispheres, over 50% of the connectome graph is a snowflake."
2538,"Of course, these non-reproducible edges are mostly weak. Our criterion for strong edges applies to between 7–16% of edges but 50–70% of synapses. We previously showed that the early olfactory system of the fly is highly stereotyped in both neuronal number and connectivity."
2539,"That study used the same EM datasets—FAFB and the hemibrain—but was limited in scope as only manual reconstruction in FAFB was then available. We now analyze brain-wide data from two brains and three hemispheres to address this question and find a high degree of stereotypy at every level: neuron counts are highly consistent between brains, as are connections above a certain weight. However, when examining so many neurons in a brain, we can see that cell counts are very different for some neurons; furthermore, neurons occasionally do something unexpected."
2540,"In fact, we hypothesize that such stochastic differences are unnoticed variability present in most brains; this is reminiscent of the observation that most humans carry multiple significant genetic mutations. We did observe one example of a substantial biological difference that was consistent across hemispheres but not brains: the number of the KCg-m neurons in the mushroom bodies is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. Notably, we found evidence that the brain compensates for this perturbation by modifying connectivity."
2541,"In conclusion, we have not collected a snowflake. The core FlyWire connectome is highly conserved, and the accompanying annotations will be broadly useful across all studies of D. melanogaster."
2542,"However, our analyses show the importance of calibrating our understanding of biological variability—as has recently been done across animals in C. elegans and across hemispheres in larval Drosophila. This will be crucial when using future connectomes to identify true biological differences, for example, in sexually dimorphic circuits or changes due to learning."
2543,"All tissues and organs in the body consist of cells. The specialized functions of cells and how they interact determine the functions of organs. The brain is an organ—indeed, the most sophisticated and complex organ that nature has devised."
2544,"But the basic strategy for unraveling its function is no different from that used to investigate the pancreas or the lung. We must begin by learning how brain cells work individually and then see how they are assembled to work together. In neuroscience, there is no need to separate the mind from the brain; once we fully understand the individual and concerted actions of brain cells, we will understand the origins of our mental abilities."
2545,"The organization of this book reflects this “neurophilosophy.” We start with the cells of the nervous system—their structure, function, and means of communication. In later chapters, we will explore how these cells are assembled into circuits that mediate sensation, perception, movement, speech, and emotion."
2546,"In this chapter, we focus on the structure of the different types of cells in the nervous system: neurons and glia. These are broad categories, within which are many types of cells that differ based on their structure, chemistry, and function. Nonetheless, the distinction between neurons and glia is important."
2547,"Although there are many neurons in the human brain, glia outnumber neurons tenfold. Based on these numbers, it might appear that we should focus our attention on glia for insights into the cellular functions of the nervous system. However, neurons are the most important cells for the unique functions of the brain."
2548,"It is the neurons that sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations. Glia, or glial cells, are thought to contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons. If the brain were a chocolate-chip cookie and the neurons were chocolate chips, the glia would be the cookie dough that fills all the other space and ensures that the chips are suspended in their appropriate locations."
2549,"Indeed, the term glia is derived from the Greek word for “glue,” giving the impression that the main function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears! As we shall see later in the chapter, the simplicity of this view is probably a good indication of the depth of our ignorance about glial function. However, we are still confident that neurons perform the bulk of information processing in the brain. Therefore, we will focus 90% of our attention on 10% of brain cells: the neurons."
2550,"Neuroscience, like other fields, has a language all its own. To use this language, you must learn the vocabulary. After you have read this chapter, take a few minutes to review the key terms list and make sure you understand the meaning of each term."
2551,"Your neuroscience vocabulary will grow as you work your way through the book. To study the structure of brain cells, scientists have had to overcome several obstacles. The first was the small size."
2552,Most cells are in the range of 0.01–0.05 mm in diameter.
2553,"The tip of an unsharpened pencil lead is about 2 mm across; neurons are 40–200 times smaller. This size is at or beyond the limit of what can be seen by the naked eye. Therefore, progress in cellular neuroscience was not possible before the development of the compound microscope in the late seventeenth century."
2554,"Even then, obstacles remained. To observe brain tissue using a microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much thicker than the diameter of the cells. However, brain tissue has a consistency similar to a bowl of Jello: not firm enough to make thin slices."
2555,"Thus, the study of the anatomy of brain cells had to await the development of a method to harden the tissue without disturbing its structure and an instrument that could produce very thin slices. Early in the nineteenth century, scientists discovered how to harden, or ""fix,"" tissues by immersing them in formaldehyde, and they developed a special device called a microtome to make very thin slices. These technical advances spawned the field of histology, the microscopic study of the structure of tissues."
2556,"But scientists studying brain structure faced yet another obstacle. Freshly prepared brain has a uniform, cream-colored appearance under the microscope; the tissue has no differences in pigmentation to enable histologists to resolve individual cells. Thus, the final breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of stains that could selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain tissue."
2557,"One stain, still used today, was introduced by the German neurologist Franz Nissl in the late nineteenth century. Nissl showed that a class of basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells and also stain clumps of material surrounding the nuclei of neurons. These clumps are called Nissl bodies, and the stain is known as the Nissl stain."
2558,"The Nissl stain is extremely useful for two reasons. First, it distinguishes neurons and glia from one another. Second, it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or cytoarchitecture, of neurons in different parts of the brain."
2559,"The study of cytoarchitecture led to the realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions. We now know that each region performs a different function. The Nissl stain, however, does not tell the whole story."
2560,"A Nissl-stained neuron looks like little more than a lump of protoplasm containing a nucleus. Neurons are much more than that, but how much more was not recognized until the publication of the work of Italian histologist Camillo Golgi. In 1873, Golgi discovered that by soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution, now called the Golgi stain, a small percentage of neurons became darkly colored in their entirety."
2561,"This revealed that the neuronal cell body, the region of the neuron around the nucleus that is shown with the Nissl stain, is actually only a small fraction of the total structure of the neuron. Notice how different histological stains can provide strikingly different views of the same tissue. Today, neurohistology remains an active field in neuroscience, along with its credo: ""The gain in brain is mainly in the stain."" The Golgi stain shows that neurons have at least two distinguishable parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region."
2562,"The swollen region containing the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably: cell body, soma, and perikaryon. The thin tubes that radiate away from the soma are called neurites and are of two types: axons and dendrites. The cell body usually gives rise to a single axon."
2563,"The axon is of uniform diameter throughout its length, and if it branches, the branches generally extend at right angles. Because axons can travel over great distances in the body, histologists of the day immediately recognized that axons must act like “wires” that carry the output of the neurons. Dendrites, on the other hand, rarely extend more than 2 mm in length."
2564,"Many dendrites extend from the cell body and generally taper to a fine point. Early histologists recognized that because dendrites come in contact with many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals, or input. Golgi invented the stain, but it was a Spanish contemporary of Golgi who used it to greatest effect."
2565,"Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a skilled histologist and artist who learned about Golgi’s method in 1888. In a remarkable series of publications over the next 25 years, Cajal used the Golgi stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain. Ironically, Golgi and Cajal drew completely opposite conclusions about neurons."
2566,"Golgi championed the view that the neurites of different cells are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar to the arteries and veins of the circulatory system. According to this reticular theory, the brain is an exception to the cell theory, which states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of all animal tissues. Cajal, on the other hand, argued forcefully that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another and must communicate by contact, not continuity."
2567,"This idea that the neuron adhered to the cell theory came to be known as the neuron doctrine. Although Golgi and Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in 1906, they remained rivals to the end. The scientific evidence over the next 50 years weighed heavily in favor of the neuron doctrine, but final proof had to wait until the development of the electron microscope in the 1950s."
2568,"With the increased resolving power of the electron microscope, it was finally possible to show that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another. Thus, our starting point in the exploration of the brain must be the individual neuron. The human eye can distinguish two points only if they are separated by more than about one-tenth of a millimeter."
2569,"Thus, we can say that 100 µm is near the limit of resolution for the unaided eye. Neurons have a diameter of about 20 µm, and neurites can measure as small as a fraction of a micrometer. The light microscope, therefore, was a necessary development before neuronal structure could be studied."
2570,"But this type of microscopy has a theoretical limit imposed by the properties of microscope lenses and visible light. With the standard light microscope, the limit of resolution is about 0.1 µm."
2571,"However, the space between neurons measures only 0.02 µm. No wonder two esteemed scientists, Golgi and Cajal, disagreed about whether neurites were continuous from one cell to the next."
2572,"This question could not be answered until the electron microscope was developed and applied to biological specimens, which occurred only within the past 60 years or so. The electron microscope uses an electron beam instead of light to form images, dramatically increasing the resolving power. The limit of resolution for an electron microscope is about 0."
2573,"1 nm—a million times better than the unaided eye. Our insights into the fine structure of the inside of neurons—the ultrastructure—have all come from electron microscopic examination of the brain. Today, microscopes on the leading edge of technology use laser beams to illuminate the tissue and computers to create digital images."
2574,"Unlike the traditional methods of light and electron microscopy, which require tissue fixation, these new techniques give neuroscientists their first chance to peer into brain tissue that is still alive. As we have seen, the neuron consists of several parts: the soma, the dendrites, and the axon. The inside of the neuron is separated from the outside by the limiting skin, the neuronal membrane, which lies like a circus tent on an intricate internal scaffolding, giving each part of the cell its special three-dimensional appearance."
2575,"Let’s explore the inside of the neuron and learn about the functions of the different parts. The Soma: We begin our tour at the soma, the roughly spherical central part of the neuron. The cell body of the typical neuron is about 20 μm in diameter."
2576,"The watery fluid inside the cell, called the cytosol, is a salty, potassium-rich solution that is separated from the outside by the neuronal membrane. Within the soma are a number of membrane-enclosed structures called organelles. The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles that are found in all animal cells."
2577,"The most important ones are the nucleus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria. Everything contained within the confines of the cell membrane, including the organelles but excluding the nucleus, is referred to collectively as the cytoplasm. The Nucleus: Its name derived from the Latin word for “nut,” the nucleus of the cell is spherical, centrally located, and about 5–10 μm across. It is contained within a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is perforated by pores that measure about 0.1 μm across."
2578,"Within the nucleus are chromosomes, which contain the genetic material, DNA. Your DNA was passed on to you from your parents, and it contains the blueprint for your entire body."
2579,"The DNA in each of your neurons is the same, and it is the same as the DNA in the cells of your liver and kidney. What distinguishes a neuron from a liver cell are the specific parts of the DNA that are used to assemble the cell. These segments of DNA are called genes."
2580,"Each chromosome contains an uninterrupted double-stranded braid of DNA, 2 nm wide. If the DNA from the 46 human chromosomes were laid out straight, end to end, it would measure more than 2 m in length. If we were to consider this total length of DNA as analogous to the string of letters that makes up this book, the genes would be analogous to the individual words."
2581,Genes can measure anywhere from 0.1 μm to several micrometers in length. The “reading” of the DNA is known as gene expression.
2582,"The final product of gene expression is the synthesis of molecules called proteins, which exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, perform many different functions, and bestow upon neurons virtually all of their unique characteristics. Protein synthesis, the assembly of protein molecules, occurs in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA never leaves the nucleus, there must be an intermediary that carries the genetic message to the sites of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm."
2583,"This function is performed by another long molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA. Messenger RNA consists of four different nucleic acids strung together in various sequences to form a chain. The detailed sequence of the nucleic acids in the chain represents the information in the gene, just as the sequence of letters gives meaning to a written word."
2584,"The process of assembling a piece of mRNA that contains the information of a gene is called transcription, and the resulting mRNA is called the transcript. Protein-coding genes are flanked by stretches of DNA that are not used to encode proteins but are important for regulating transcription. At one end of the gene is the promoter, the region where the RNA-synthesizing enzyme, RNA polymerase, binds to initiate transcription."
2585,"The binding of the polymerase to the promoter is tightly regulated by other proteins called transcription factors. At the other end is a sequence of DNA called the terminator that the RNA polymerase recognizes as the endpoint for transcription. In addition to the non-coding regions of DNA that flank the genes, there are often additional stretches of DNA within the gene itself that cannot be used to code for protein."
2586,"These interspersed regions are called introns, and the coding sequences are called exons. Initial transcripts contain both introns and exons, but then, by a process called RNA splicing, the introns are removed and the remaining exons are fused together. In some cases, specific exons are also removed along with the introns, leaving an ""alternatively spliced"" mRNA that actually encodes a different protein."
2587,"Thus, transcription of a single gene can ultimately give rise to several different mRNAs and protein products. Messenger RNA transcripts emerge from the nucleus via pores in the nuclear envelope and travel to the sites of protein synthesis elsewhere in the neuron. At these sites, a protein molecule is assembled much as the mRNA molecule was: by linking together many small molecules into a chain."
2588,"In the case of protein, the building blocks are amino acids, of which there are 20 different kinds. This assembly of proteins from amino acids under the direction of the mRNA is called translation. The scientific study of this process, which begins with the DNA of the nucleus and ends with the synthesis of protein molecules in the cell, is known as molecular biology."
2589,"The ""central dogma"" of molecular biology is summarized as follows: A new field within neuroscience is called molecular neurobiology. Molecular neurobiologists use the information contained in the genes to determine the structure and functions of neuronal proteins. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum."
2590,"Not far from the nucleus are enclosed stacks of membrane dotted with dense globular structures called ribosomes, which measure about 25 nm in diameter. The stacks are called rough endoplasmic reticulum, or rough ER. Rough ER abounds in neurons, far more than in glia or most other non-neuronal cells."
2591,"In fact, we have already been introduced to rough ER by another name: Nissl bodies. This organelle is stained with the dyes that Nissl introduced 100 years ago. Rough ER is a major site of protein synthesis in neurons."
2592,"RNA transcripts bind to the ribosomes, and the ribosomes translate the instructions contained in the mRNA to assemble a protein molecule. Thus, ribosomes take raw material in the form of amino acids and manufacture proteins using the blueprint provided by the mRNA. Not all ribosomes are attached to the rough ER."
2593,"Many are freely floating and are called free ribosomes. Several free ribosomes may appear to be attached by a thread; these are called polyribosomes. The thread is a single strand of mRNA, and the associated ribosomes are working on it to make multiple copies of the same protein."
2594,"What is the difference between proteins synthesized on the rough ER and those synthesized on the free ribosomes? The answer appears to lie in the intended fate of the protein molecule. If it is destined to reside within the cytosol of the neuron, then the protein’s mRNA transcript shuns the ribosomes of the rough ER and gravitates toward the free ribosomes."
2595,"Sequencing the human genome—the entire length of DNA that comprises the genetic information in our chromosomes—was a truly monumental achievement completed in 2003. The Human Genome Project identified all of the approximately 20,000 genes in human DNA. We now live in what has been called the “post-genomic era,” in which information about the genes expressed in our tissues can be used to diagnose and treat diseases."
2596,"Neuroscientists are now using this information to tackle long-standing questions about the biological basis of neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to probe deeper into the origins of individuality. The logic goes as follows: the brain is the product of the genes expressed in it."
2597,"Differences in gene expression between a normal brain and a diseased brain, or a brain of unusual ability, can be used to identify the molecular basis of the observed symptoms or traits. The level of gene expression is usually defined as the number of mRNA transcripts synthesized by different cells and tissues to direct the synthesis of specific proteins. Thus, the analysis of gene expression requires a method to compare the relative abundance of various mRNAs in the brains of two groups of humans or animals."
2598,"One way to perform such a comparison is to use DNA microarrays, which are created by robotic machines that arrange thousands of small spots of synthetic DNA on a microscope slide. Each spot contains a unique DNA sequence that will recognize and stick to a different specific mRNA sequence. To compare the gene expression in two brains, one begins by collecting a sample of mRNAs from each brain."
2599,"The mRNA of one brain is labeled with a chemical tag that fluoresces green, and the mRNA of the other brain is labeled with a tag that fluoresces red. These samples are then applied to the microarray. Highly expressed genes will produce brightly fluorescent spots, and differences in the relative gene expression between the brains will be revealed by differences in the color of the fluorescence."
2600,"However, if the protein is destined to be inserted into the membrane of the cell or an organelle, then it is synthesized on the rough ER. As the protein is being assembled, it is threaded back and forth through the membrane of the rough ER, where it is trapped. It is not surprising that neurons are so well endowed with rough ER because, as we shall see in later chapters, special membrane proteins are what give these cells their remarkable information-processing abilities."
2601,"Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi Apparatus. The remainder of the cytosol of the soma is crowded with stacks of membranous organelles that look a lot like rough ER without the ribosomes, so much so that one type is called smooth endoplasmic reticulum or smooth ER. Smooth ER is actually quite heterogeneous and performs different functions in different locations."
2602,"Some smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is continuous with rough ER and is believed to be a site where the proteins that jut out from the membrane are carefully folded, giving them their three-dimensional structure. Other types of smooth ER play no direct role in the processing of protein molecules but instead regulate the internal concentrations of substances such as calcium. The stack of membrane-enclosed disks in the soma that lies farthest from the nucleus is the Golgi apparatus, first described in 1898 by Camillo Golgi."
2603,"This is a site of extensive “post-translational” chemical processing of proteins. One important function of the Golgi apparatus is believed to be the sorting of certain proteins that are destined for delivery to different parts of the neuron, such as the axon and the dendrites."
2604,"Another very abundant organelle in the soma is the mitochondrion. In neurons, these sausage-shaped structures measure about 1 μm in length. Within the enclosure of their outer membrane are multiple folds of inner membrane called cristae."
2605,"Between the cristae is an inner space called the matrix. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration. When a mitochondrion “inhales,” it pulls inside pyruvic acid and oxygen, both of which are floating in the cytosol."
2606,"Within the inner compartment of the mitochondrion, pyruvic acid enters into a complex series of biochemical reactions called the Krebs cycle, named after the German-British scientist Hans Krebs, who first proposed it in 1937. The biochemical products of the Krebs cycle provide energy that, in another series of reactions within the cristae, results in the addition of phosphate to adenosine diphosphate, yielding adenosine triphosphate, the cell’s energy source. When the mitochondrion “exhales,” 17 ATP molecules are released for every molecule of pyruvic acid that had been taken in."
2607,"ATP is the energy currency of the cell. The chemical energy stored in ATP is used to fuel most of the biochemical reactions of the neuron. For example, as we shall see in Chapter 3, special proteins in the neuronal membrane use the energy released by the breakdown of ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to pump certain substances across the membrane to establish concentration differences between the inside and the outside of the neuron."
2608,"The neuronal membrane serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron. The membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins. As mentioned earlier, some of the membrane-associated proteins pump substances from the inside to the outside."
2609,"Others form pores that regulate which substances can gain access to the inside of the neuron. An important characteristic of neurons is that the protein composition of the membrane varies depending on whether it is in the soma, the dendrites, or the axon. The function of neurons cannot be understood without understanding the structure and function of the membrane and its associated proteins."
2610,"In fact, this topic is so important that we’ll spend a good deal of the next four chapters looking at how the membrane endows neurons with the remarkable ability to transfer electrical signals throughout the brain and body. Earlier, we compared the neuronal membrane to a circus tent that was draped on an internal scaffolding. This scaffolding is called the cytoskeleton, and it gives the neuron its characteristic shape."
2611,"The “bones” of the cytoskeleton are the microtubules, microfilaments, and neurofilaments. By drawing an analogy with a scaffolding, we do not mean that the cytoskeleton is static. On the contrary, elements of the cytoskeleton are dynamically regulated and are very likely in continual motion."
2612,"Your neurons are probably squirming around in your head even as you read this sentence. Microtubules, measuring 20 nm in diameter, are large and run longitudinally down neurites."
2613,"A microtubule appears as a straight, thick-walled hollow pipe. The wall of the pipe is composed of smaller strands that are braided like rope around the hollow core. Each of the smaller strands consists of the protein tubulin."
2614,"A single tubulin molecule is small and globular; the strand consists of tubulins stuck together like pearls on a string. The process of joining small proteins to form a long strand is called polymerization; the resulting strand is called a polymer. Polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules and, therefore, of neuronal shape can be regulated by various signals within the neuron."
2615,"One class of proteins that participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly and function are microtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs. Among other functions, MAPs anchor the microtubules to one another and to other parts of the neuron. Pathological changes in an axonal MAP, called tau, have been implicated in the dementia that accompanies Alzheimer’s disease."
2616,"Neurites are the most remarkable structural feature of a neuron. Their elaborate branching patterns, critical for information processing, reflect the organization of the underlying cytoskeleton. It is therefore no surprise that a devastating loss of brain function can result when the cytoskeleton of neurons is disrupted."
2617,"An example is Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by the disruption of the cytoskeleton of neurons in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain crucial for cognitive function. This disorder and its underlying brain pathology were first described in 1907 by the German physician A. Alzheimer in a paper titled ""A Characteristic Disease of the Cerebral Cortex."" Below are excerpts from the English translation."
2618,"One of the first disease symptoms of a 51-year-old woman was a strong feeling of jealousy toward her husband. Very soon she showed rapidly increasing memory impairments; she could not find her way about her home, dragged objects to and fro, hid herself, or sometimes thought that people were out to kill her, and then she would start to scream loudly."
2619,"During institutionalization, her gestures showed a complete helplessness. She was disoriented as to time and place. From time to time, she would state that she did not understand anything, that she felt confused and totally lost."
2620,"Sometimes she considered the arrival of the doctor as an official visit and apologized for not having finished her work, but other times she would start to yell in fear that the doctor wanted to operate on her; there were times that she would send him away in complete indignation, uttering phrases that indicated her fear that the doctor wanted to damage her woman’s honor. From time to time, she was completely delirious, dragging her blankets and sheets to and fro, calling for her husband and daughter, and seeming to have auditory hallucinations. Often she would scream for hours in a horrible voice."
2621,"Mental regression advanced quite steadily. After four and a half years of illness, the patient died. She was completely apathetic in the end and was confined to bed in a fetal position."
2622,"Following her death, Alzheimer examined the woman’s brain under the microscope. He made particular note of changes in the “neurofibrils,” elements of the cytoskeleton that are stained by a silver solution. The Bielschowsky silver preparation showed very characteristic changes in the neurofibrils."
2623,"However, inside an apparently normal-looking cell, one or more single fibers could be observed that became prominent through their striking thickness and specific impregnability. At a more advanced stage, many fibrils arranged parallel showed the same changes. Then they accumulated, forming dense bundles and gradually advanced to the surface of the cell."
2624,"Eventually, the nucleus and cytoplasm disappeared, and only a tangled bundle of fibrils indicated the site where once the neuron had been located. As these fibrils can be stained with dyes different from the normal neurofibrils, a chemical transformation of the fibril substance must have taken place. This might be the reason why the fibrils survived the destruction of the cell."
2625,"It seems that the transformation of the fibrils goes hand in hand with the storage of a yet not closely examined pathological product of the metabolism in the neuron. About one-quarter to one-third of all the neurons of the cerebral cortex showed such alterations. Numerous neurons, especially in the upper cell layers, had totally disappeared."
2626,"The severity of the dementia in Alzheimer’s disease is well correlated with the number and distribution of what are now commonly known as neurofibrillary tangles, the “tombstones” of dead and dying neurons. Indeed, as Alzheimer speculated, tangle formation in the cerebral cortex very likely causes the symptoms of the disease. Electron microscopy reveals that the major components of the tangles are paired helical filaments, long fibrous proteins braided together like strands of a rope."
2627,"It is now understood that these filaments consist of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau normally functions as a bridge between the microtubules in axons, ensuring that they run straight and parallel to one another. In Alzheimer’s disease, tau detaches from the microtubules and accumulates in the soma."
2628,"This disruption of the cytoskeleton causes the axons to wither, thus impeding the normal flow of information in the affected neurons. What causes the changes in tau? Attention is focused on another protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, called amyloid."
2629,"The field of Alzheimer’s disease research moves very fast, but the consensus today is that the abnormal secretion of amyloid by neurons is the first step in the process that leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation and dementia. Current hope for therapeutic intervention is focused on strategies to reduce the deposition of amyloid in the brain. The need for effective therapy is urgent: In the United States alone, more than 4 million people are afflicted with this tragic disease."
2630,"Microfilaments. Measuring only 5 nm in diameter, microfilaments are about the same thickness as the cell membrane. Found throughout the neuron, they are particularly numerous in the neurites."
2631,"Microfilaments are braids of two thin strands, and the strands are polymers of the protein actin. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells of all types, including neurons, and is believed to play a role in changing cell shape. Indeed, as we shall see in Chapter 13, actin filaments are critically involved in the mechanism of muscle contraction."
2632,"Like microtubules, actin microfilaments are constantly undergoing assembly and disassembly, and this process is regulated by signals in the neuron. Besides running longitudinally down the core of the neurites like microtubules, microfilaments are also closely associated with the membrane. They are anchored to the membrane by attachments with a meshwork of fibrous proteins that line the inside of the membrane like a spider web."
2633,"Neurofilaments, with a diameter of 10 nm, are intermediate in size between microtubules and microfilaments. They exist in all cells of the body as intermediate filaments; only in neurons are they called neurofilaments."
2634,"The difference in name actually reflects subtle differences in structure from one tissue to the next. An example of an intermediate filament from another tissue is keratin, which, when bundled together, makes up hair. Of the types of fibrous structures we have discussed, neurofilaments most closely resemble the bones and ligaments of the skeleton."
2635,"A neurofilament consists of multiple subunits that are organized like a chain of sausages. The internal structure of each subunit consists of three protein strands woven together. Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, these strands consist of individual long protein molecules, each of which is coiled in a tight, springlike configuration."
2636,"This structure makes neurofilaments mechanically very strong. The Axon. So far, we have explored the soma, organelles, membrane, and cytoskeleton. However, none of these structures is unique to neurons; they are found in all the cells in our body."
2637,"Now we encounter the axon, a structure found only in neurons that is highly specialized for the transfer of information over distances in the nervous system. The axon begins with a region called the axon hillock, which tapers to form the initial segment of the axon proper. Two noteworthy features distinguish the axon from the soma: 1."
2638,"No rough ER extends into the axon, and there are few, if any, free ribosomes. 2. The protein composition of the axon membrane is fundamentally different from that of the soma membrane."
2639,"These structural differences translate into functional distinctions. Because there are no ribosomes, there is no protein synthesis in the axon. This means that all proteins in the axon must originate in the soma."
2640,"It is the different proteins in the axonal membrane that enable it to serve as the “telegraph wire” that sends information over great distances. Axons may extend from less than a millimeter to over a meter long. Axons often branch, and these branches are called axon collaterals."
2641,"Occasionally, an axon collateral will return to communicate with the same cell that gave rise to the axon or with the dendrites of neighboring cells. These axon branches are called recurrent collaterals. The diameter of an axon is variable, ranging from less than 1 µm to about 25 µm in humans and to as large as 1 mm in the squid."
2642,"This variation in axon size is important. As will be explained in Chapter 4, the speed of the electrical signal that sweeps down the axon—the nerve impulse—varies depending on axonal diameter. The thicker the axon, the faster the impulse travels."
2643,"The Axon Terminal. All axons have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The end is called the axon terminal or terminal bouton, reflecting the fact that it usually appears as a swollen disk."
2644,"The terminal is a site where the axon comes in contact with other neurons and passes information on to them. This point of contact is called the synapse, a word derived from the Greek, meaning “to fasten together.” Sometimes axons have many branches at their ends, and each branch forms a synapse on dendrites or cell bodies in the same region."
2645,These branches are collectively called the terminal arbor. Sometimes axons form synapses at swollen regions along their length and then continue on to terminate elsewhere. Such swellings are called boutons en passant.
2646,"In either case, when a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell, it is said to innervate that cell or to provide innervation. The cytoplasm of the axon terminal differs from that of the axon in several ways: The Synapse. Although Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted entirely to how information is transferred from one neuron to another at the synapse, we provide a preview here."
2647,"The synapse has two sides: presynaptic and postsynaptic. These names indicate the usual direction of information flow, which is from “pre” to “post.” The presynaptic side generally consists of an axon terminal, while the postsynaptic side may be the dendrite or soma of another neuron."
2648,"The space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes is called the synaptic cleft. The transfer of information at the synapse from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission. At most synapses, information in the form of electrical impulses traveling down the axon is converted in the terminal into a chemical signal that crosses the synaptic cleft."
2649,"On the postsynaptic membrane, this chemical signal is converted again into an electrical one. The chemical signal is called a neurotransmitter, and it is stored in and released from the synaptic vesicles within the terminal. As we will see, different neurotransmitters are used by different types of neurons."
2650,"This electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical transformation of information makes possible many of the brain’s computational abilities. Modification of this process is involved in memory and learning, and synaptic transmission dysfunction accounts for certain mental disorders. The synapse is also the site of action for many toxins and for most psychoactive drugs."
2651,"Axoplasmic Transport. As mentioned, one feature of the cytoplasm of axons, including the terminal, is the absence of ribosomes. Because ribosomes are the protein factories of the cell, their absence means that the proteins of the axon must be synthesized in the soma and then shipped down the axon."
2652,"Indeed, in the mid-nineteenth century, English physiologist Augustus Waller showed that axons cannot be sustained when separated from their parent cell body. The degeneration of axons that occurs when they are cut is now called Wallerian degeneration. Because it can be detected with certain staining methods, Wallerian degeneration is one way to trace axonal connections in the brain."
2653,"Wallerian degeneration occurs because the normal flow of materials from the soma to the axon terminal is interrupted. This movement of material down the axon is called axoplasmic transport, which was first demonstrated directly by the experiments of American neurobiologist Paul Weiss and his colleagues in the 1940s. They found that if they tied a thread around an axon, material accumulated on the side of the axon closest to the soma."
2654,"When the knot was untied, the accumulated material continued down the axon at a rate of 1–10 mm per day. This was a remarkable discovery, but it is not the whole story. If all material moved down the axon by this transport mechanism alone, it would not reach the ends of the longest axons for at least half a year—too long a wait to feed hungry synapses."
2655,"In the late 1960s, methods were developed to track the movements of protein molecules down the axon into the terminal. These methods entailed injecting the somata of neurons with radioactive amino acids. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins."
2656,"The “hot” amino acids were assembled into proteins, and the arrival of radioactive proteins in the axon terminal was measured to calculate the rate of transport. Bernice Grafstein of Rockefeller University discovered that this fast axoplasmic transport occurred at a rate as high as 1000 mm per day. Much is now known about how axoplasmic transport works."
2657,"Material is enclosed within vesicles, which then “walk down” the microtubules of the axon. The “legs” are provided by a protein called kinesin, and the process is fueled by ATP. Kinesin moves material only from the soma to the terminal."
2658,"All movement of material in this direction is called anterograde transport. In addition to anterograde transport, there is a mechanism for the movement of material up the axon from the terminal to the soma. This process is believed to provide signals to the soma about changes in the metabolic needs of the axon terminal."
2659,"Movement in this direction, from terminal to soma, is called retrograde transport. The molecular mechanism is similar to anterograde transport, except the “legs” for retrograde transport are provided by a different protein, dynein. Both anterograde and retrograde transport mechanisms have been exploited by neuroscientists to trace connections in the brain."
2660,"The term dendrite is derived from the Greek for “tree,” reflecting the fact that these neurites resemble the branches of a tree as they extend from the soma. The dendrites of a single neuron are collectively called a dendritic tree; each branch of the tree is called a dendritic branch. The wide variety of shapes and sizes of dendritic trees are used to classify different groups of neurons."
2661,"Because dendrites function as the antennae of the neuron, they are covered with thousands of synapses. The dendritic membrane under the synapse has many specialized protein molecules called receptors that detect the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Fast anterograde transport of proteins in axons was shown by injecting the soma with radioactive amino acids."
2662,"The success of this method immediately suggested a way to trace connections in the brain. For example, to determine where neurons in the eye send their axons, the eye was injected with radioactive proline, an amino acid. The proline was incorporated into proteins in the somas that were then transported to the axon terminals."
2663,"By using a technique called autoradiography, the location of radioactive axon terminals could be detected, thereby revealing the extent of the connection between the eye and the brain. Researchers subsequently discovered that retrograde transport could also be exploited to work out connections in the brain. Strangely enough, the enzyme horseradish peroxidase is selectively taken up by axon terminals and then transported retrogradely to the soma."
2664,A chemical reaction can then be initiated to visualize the location of the horseradish peroxidase in slices of brain tissue. This method is commonly used to trace connections in the brain. Some viruses also exploit retrograde transport to infect neurons.
2665,"For example, the oral type of herpesvirus enters axon terminals in the lips and mouth and is then transported back to the parent cell bodies. Here the virus usually remains dormant until physical or emotional stress occurs, at which time it replicates and returns to the nerve ending, causing a painful cold sore. Similarly, the rabies virus enters the nervous system by retrograde transport through axons in the skin."
2666,"However, once inside the soma, the virus wastes no time in replicating rapidly, killing its neuronal host. The virus is then taken up by other neurons within the nervous system, and the process repeats itself again and again, usually until the victim dies. The dendrites of some neurons are covered with specialized structures called dendritic spines that receive some types of synaptic input."
2667,Spines look like little punching bags that hang off the dendrite. The unusual morphology of spines has fascinated neuroscientists ever since their discovery by Cajal. They are believed to isolate various chemical reactions that are triggered by some types of synaptic activation.
2668,Spine structure is sensitive to the type and amount of synaptic activity. Unusual changes in spines have been shown to occur in the brains of individuals with cognitive impairments. William Greenough of the University of Illinois at Urbana discovered that spine number is also very sensitive to the quality of the environment experienced during early development and in adulthood.
2669,"The elaborate architecture of a neuron’s dendritic tree is a good reflection of the complexity of its synaptic connections with other neurons. Brain function depends on these highly precise synaptic connections, which are formed during the fetal period and are refined during infancy and early childhood. Not surprisingly, this very complex developmental process is vulnerable to disruption."
2670,"Mental retardation is said to occur if a disruption of brain development results in subaverage cognitive functioning that impairs adaptive behavior. The use of standardized tests indicates that intelligence in the general population is distributed along a bell-shaped curve. By convention, the mean intelligence quotient is set to be 100."
2671,"About two-thirds of the total population falls within 15 points of the mean, and 95% of the population falls within 30 points. People with intelligence scores below 70 are considered to have mental retardation if the cognitive impairment affects the person’s ability to adapt his or her behavior to the setting in which he or she lives. Some 2–3% of humans fit this description."
2672,Mental retardation has many causes. The most severe forms are associated with genetic disorders. An example is a condition called phenylketonuria.
2673,"The basic abnormality is a deficit in the liver enzyme that metabolizes the dietary amino acid phenylalanine. Infants born with PKU have an abnormally high level of the amino acid in the blood and brain. If the condition goes untreated, brain growth is stunted and severe mental retardation results."
2674,"Another example is Down syndrome, which occurs when the fetus has an extra copy of chromosome 21, thus disrupting normal gene expression during brain development. A second known cause of mental retardation is accidents during pregnancy and childbirth. Examples are maternal infections with German measles and asphyxia during childbirth."
2675,"A third cause of mental retardation is poor nutrition during pregnancy. An example is fetal alcohol syndrome, a constellation of developmental abnormalities that occur in children born to alcoholic mothers. A fourth cause, thought to account for the majority of cases, is environmental impoverishment—the lack of good nutrition, socialization, and sensory stimulation—during infancy."
2676,"While some forms of mental retardation have very clear physical correlates, most cases have only behavioral manifestations. The brains of these individuals appear grossly normal. How, then, do we account for the profound cognitive impairment?"
2677,"An important clue came in the 1970s from the research of Miguel Marin-Padilla, working at Dartmouth College, and Dominick Purpura, working at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Using the Golgi stain, they studied the brains of children with mental retardation and discovered remarkable changes in dendritic structure. The dendrites of these children had many fewer dendritic spines, and the spines that they did have were unusually long and thin."
2678,The extent of the spine changes was well correlated with the degree of mental retardation. Dendritic spines are an important target of synaptic input. Purpura pointed out that the dendritic spines of mentally retarded children resemble those of the normal human fetus.
2679,"He suggested that mental retardation reflects the failure of normal circuits to form in the brain. In the three decades since this seminal work was published, it has been established that normal synaptic development, including the maturation of dendritic spines, depends critically on the environment during infancy and early childhood. An impoverished environment during an early ""critical period"" of development can lead to profound changes in the circuits of the brain."
2680,"However, there is some good news. Many of the deprivation-induced changes in the brain can be reversed if intervention occurs early enough. In Chapter 22, we will take a closer look at the role of experience in brain development."
2681,"It is a frequent misconception that scientific research results in simple, clear answers to questions. The truth is that almost every answer results in a whole battery of new questions. But the research serves to increase our understanding so that we know how to frame the new questions and try to tackle them."
2682,"When we first saw polyribosomes below synapses in dendritic spines, we asked: “What are they doing away from the soma, where mRNA is usually translated?” An exciting possibility was that they might make special proteins that were involved in remodeling the synapse. I had seen that in animals exposed to enriched environments, new spines were made and other spines were remodeled from small to larger structures with—presumably—more efficient signaling."
2683,"Could these synaptic polyribosomes be manufacturing crucial proteins that could account for the improved efficiency? Some kind of “memory proteins”? I recalled a paper by Hollingsworth, in which he figured out a way to shear off synapses on spines, a preparation called synaptoneurosomes, and study them biochemically."
2684,"My colleague Ivan Jeanne Weiler and I attempted to isolate the mRNA in synaptoneurosomes to identify the crucial “memory proteins.” Repeated failures, due apparently to mRNA degradation, both frustrated and slowed us. But eventually we found that some of the mRNA was being incorporated into polyribosomes, meaning that protein was being synthesized."
2685,"We then discovered that this protein synthesis was strongly increased when we stimulated the synaptoneurosomes with the neurotransmitter glutamate, and we were able to identify the glutamate receptor that was responsible. We now thought we were poised to isolate the “memory proteins” from the newly assembled polyribosomes. We set up to harvest polyribosomes from stimulated and unstimulated synaptoneurosomes to see which mRNAs were translated in response to glutamate."
2686,"About this time, Jim Eberwine told us about the mRNAs he had isolated from single dendrites. We looked for their translation in our new system, and the first one that was increased by stimulation turned out to be the fragile X mental retardation protein. This has led us to study brain abnormalities in fragile X syndrome, the largest cause of inherited mental retardation."
2687,"Do we now, at last, have a “memory protein”? Not yet, because FMRP is not a structural or receptor protein, but a protein that binds mRNA. It seems to orchestrate the translation of an impressive array of other mRNAs, few of which, at first glance, look like “memory proteins.” But, if FMRP is a key to how the synapse changes itself, then we think we are still on the right track to understand synaptic remodeling. Indeed, people with fragile X syndrome have immature-appearing synapses. So we have been wrong a lot of the time and frustrated on a near-weekly basis."
2688,"Nature is full of surprises, but we have increased our understanding of synaptic protein synthesis. Indeed, we are now asking new questions that may help us understand and possibly treat the leading inherited form of mental retardation. It was worth the effort."
2689,"For the most part, the cytoplasm of dendrites resembles that of axons. It is filled with cytoskeletal elements and mitochondria. One interesting difference was discovered by neuroscientist Oswald Steward."
2690,"He found that polyribosomes can be observed in dendrites, often right under spines. Steward’s research suggests that synaptic transmission can actually direct local protein synthesis in some neurons. In Chapter 25, we will see that synaptic regulation of protein synthesis is crucial for information storage by the brain."
2691,"It is unlikely that we can ever hope to understand how each of the hundred billion neurons in the nervous system uniquely contributes to the function of the brain. But what if we could show that all the neurons in the brain can be divided into a small number of categories, and that within each category, all neurons function identically? The complexity of the problem might then be reduced to understanding the unique contribution of each category, rather than each cell."
2692,It is with this hope that neuroscientists have devised schemes for classifying neurons. Neurons can be classified according to the total number of neurites that extend from the soma. A neuron that has a single neurite is said to be unipolar.
2693,"If there are two neurites, the cell is bipolar, and if there are three or more, the cell is multipolar. Most neurons in the brain are multipolar. Dendritic trees can vary widely from one type of neuron to another."
2694,"Some have inspired elegant names like ""double bouquet cells."" Others have less interesting names, such as ""alpha cells."" Classification is often unique to a particular part of the brain."
2695,"For example, in the cerebral cortex, there are two broad classes: stellate cells and pyramidal cells. Another simple way to classify neurons is according to whether their dendrites have spines. Those that do are called spiny, and those that do not are called aspinous."
2696,"These dendritic classification schemes can overlap. For example, in the cerebral cortex, all pyramidal cells are spiny. Stellate cells, on the other hand, can be either spiny or aspinous."
2697,"Information is delivered to the nervous system by neurons that have neurites in the sensory surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the retina of the eye. Cells with these connections are called primary sensory neurons. Other neurons have axons that form synapses with the muscles and command movements; these are called motor neurons."
2698,"But most neurons in the nervous system form connections only with other neurons. According to this classification scheme, these cells are all called interneurons. Some neurons have long axons that extend from one part of the brain to the other; these are called Golgi type I neurons, or projection neurons."
2699,"Other neurons have short axons that do not extend beyond the vicinity of the cell body; these are called Golgi type II neurons, or local circuit neurons. In the cerebral cortex, for example, pyramidal cells usually have long axons that extend to other parts of the brain and are therefore Golgi type I neurons. In contrast, stellate cells have axons that never extend beyond the cerebral cortex and are therefore Golgi type II neurons."
2700,"The classification schemes presented so far are based on the morphology of neurons as revealed by a Golgi stain. Newer methods that enable neuroscientists to identify which neurons contain specific neurotransmitters have resulted in a scheme for classifying neurons based on their chemistry. For example, the motor neurons that command voluntary movements all release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at their synapses."
2701,"These cells are therefore also classified as cholinergic, meaning that they use this particular neurotransmitter. Collections of cells that use a common neurotransmitter make up the brain’s neurotransmitter systems. We have devoted most of our attention in this chapter to the neurons."
2702,"While this decision is justified by the state of current knowledge, some neuroscientists consider glia to be the ""sleeping giants"" of neuroscience. One day, they suppose, it will be shown that glia contribute much more significantly to information processing in the brain than is currently appreciated. At present, however, the evidence indicates that glia contribute to brain function mainly by supporting neuronal functions."
2703,"Although their role may be subordinate, without glia, the brain could not function properly. The most numerous glia in the brain are called astrocytes. These cells fill the spaces between neurons."
2704,"The space that remains between the neurons and the astrocytes in the brain measures only about 20 nm wide. Consequently, astrocytes probably influence whether a neurite can grow or retract. And when we speak of fluid ""bathing"" neurons in the brain, it is more like soaking from a hose than immersion in a swimming pool."
2705,"An essential role of astrocytes is regulating the chemical content of this extracellular space. For example, astrocytes envelop synaptic junctions in the brain, thereby restricting the spread of neurotransmitter molecules that have been released. Astrocytes also have special proteins in their membranes that actively remove many neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft."
2706,"A recent and unexpected discovery is that astrocytic membranes also possess neurotransmitter receptors that, like the receptors on neurons, can trigger electrical and biochemical events inside the glial cell. Besides regulating neurotransmitters, astrocytes also tightly control the extracellular concentration of several substances that have the potential to interfere with proper neuronal function. For example, astrocytes regulate the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid."
2707,"Unlike astrocytes, the primary function of oligodendroglial and Schwann cells is clear. These glia provide layers of membrane that insulate axons. Boston University anatomist Alan Peters, a pioneer in the electron microscopic study of the nervous system, showed that this wrapping, called myelin, spirals around axons in the brain."
2708,"Because the axon fits inside the spiral wrapping like a sword in its scabbard, the name myelin sheath describes the entire covering. The sheath is interrupted periodically, leaving a short length where the axonal membrane is exposed. This region is called a node of Ranvier."
2709,"We will see in Chapter 4 that myelin serves to speed the propagation of nerve impulses down the axon. Oligodendroglia and Schwann cells differ in their location and some other characteristics. For example, oligodendroglia are found only in the central nervous system, while Schwann cells are found only in the peripheral nervous system."
2710,"Another difference is that one oligodendroglial cell will contribute myelin to several axons, while each Schwann cell myelinates only a single axon. Even if we eliminated every neuron, every astrocyte, and every oligodendroglial cell, other cells would still remain in the brain. For the sake of completeness, we must mention these other cells."
2711,"First, special cells called ependymal cells provide the lining of fluid-filled ventricles within the brain, and they also play a role in directing cell migration during brain development. Second, a class of cells called microglia functions as phagocytes to remove debris left by dead or degenerating neurons and glia. Finally, the vasculature of the brain—arteries, veins, and capillaries—would still be there."
2712,"Learning about the structural characteristics of the neuron provides insight into how neurons and their different parts work, because structure correlates with function. For example, the absence of ribosomes in the axon correctly predicts that proteins in the axon terminal must be provided by the soma via axoplasmic transport. A large number of mitochondria in the axon terminal correctly predicts a high energy demand."
2713,"The elaborate structure of the dendritic tree appears ideally suited for the receipt of incoming information, and indeed, this is where most of the synapses are formed with the axons of other neurons. From the time of Nissl, it has been recognized that an important feature of neurons is the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). What does this tell us about neurons?"
2714,"We have said that rough ER is a site of the synthesis of proteins destined to be inserted into the membrane. We will now see how the various proteins in the neuronal membrane give rise to the unique capabilities of neurons to transmit, receive, and store information. Vision is remarkable—it lets us detect things as tiny and close as a mosquito on the tip of our nose or as immense and far away as a galaxy near the fringes of the universe."
2715,"Sensitivity to light enables animals, including humans, to detect prey, predators, and mates. Based on the light reflected into our eyes from objects around us, we somehow make sense of a complex world. While this process seems effortless, it is, in reality, extremely complicated."
2716,"Indeed, it has proven quite difficult to create computer visual systems with even a small fraction of the capabilities of the human visual system. Light is electromagnetic energy that is emitted in the form of waves. We live in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic radiation."
2717,"Like any ocean, this sea has large waves and small waves, short wavelets and long rollers. The waves crash into objects and are absorbed, scattered, reflected, and bent. Because of the nature of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with the environment, the visual system can extract information about the world."
2718,"This is a big job, and it requires a lot of neural machinery. However, the mastery of vision over the course of vertebrate evolution has had surprising rewards. It has provided new ways to communicate, given rise to brain mechanisms for predicting the trajectory of objects and events in time and space, allowed for new forms of mental imagery and abstraction, and led to the creation of a world of art."
2719,"The significance of vision is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that about half of the human cerebral cortex is involved in analyzing the visual world. The mammalian visual system begins with the eye. At the back of the eye is the retina, which contains photoreceptors specialized to convert light energy into neural activity."
2720,"The rest of the eye acts like a camera and forms crisp, clear images of the world on the retina. Like a camera, the eye automatically adjusts to differences in illumination and focuses itself on objects of interest. The eye has some additional features not yet available on cameras, such as the ability to track moving objects and the ability to keep its transparent surfaces clean."
2721,"While much of the eye functions like a camera, the retina is much more than film. In fact, the retina is actually part of the brain. In a sense, each eye has two overlapping retinas: one specialized for low light levels that we encounter from dusk to dawn and another specialized for higher light levels and for the detection of color from sunrise to sunset."
2722,"Regardless of the time of day, the output of the retina is not a faithful reproduction of the intensity of the light falling on it. Rather, the retina is specialized to detect differences in the intensity of light falling on different parts of it. Image processing is well underway in the retina before any visual information reaches the rest of the brain."
2723,"Axons of retinal neurons are bundled into optic nerves, which distribute visual information to several brain structures that perform different functions. Some targets of the optic nerves are involved in regulating biological rhythms, synchronized with the light-dark daily cycle; others are involved in the control of eye position and optics. However, the first synaptic relay in the pathway that serves visual perception occurs in a cell group of the dorsal thalamus called the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN."
2724,"From the LGN, visual information ascends to the cerebral cortex, where it is interpreted and remembered. In this chapter, we explore the eye and the retina. We will see how light carries information to our visual system, how the eye forms images on the retina, and how the retina converts light energy into neural signals that can be used to extract information about luminance and color differences."
2725,"In the following chapter, we will pick up the visual pathway at the back of the eye and take it through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. The visual system uses light to form images of the world around us. Let’s briefly review the physical properties of light and its interactions with the environment."
2726,"Electromagnetic radiation is all around us. It comes from innumerable sources, including radio antennas, mobile phones, X-ray machines, and the sun. Light is the electromagnetic radiation that is visible to our eyes."
2727,"Electromagnetic radiation can be described as a wave of energy. Like any wave, electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength, the distance between successive peaks or troughs; a frequency, the number of waves per second; and an amplitude, the difference between wave trough and peak. The energy content of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to its frequency."
2728,"Radiation emitted at a high frequency has the highest energy content; examples are gamma radiation emitted by some radioactive materials and X-rays used for medical imaging, with wavelengths less than 10⁻² m. Conversely, radiation emitted at lower frequencies has less energy; examples are radar and radio waves, with wavelengths greater than 1 mm. Only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum is detectable by our visual system; visible light consists of wavelengths of 400–700 nm."
2729,"As first shown by Isaac Newton early in the eighteenth century, the mix of wavelengths in this range emitted by the sun appears to humans as white, whereas light of a single wavelength appears as one of the colors of the rainbow. It is interesting to note that a ""hot"" color like red or orange consists of light with a longer wavelength and hence has less energy than a ""cool"" color like blue or violet. Clearly, colors are themselves ""colored"" by the brain, based on our subjective experiences."
2730,"In a vacuum, a wave of electromagnetic radiation will travel in a straight line and thus can be described as a ray. Light rays in our environment also travel in straight lines until they interact with the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere and objects on the ground. These interactions include reflection, absorption, and refraction."
2731,The study of light rays and their interactions is called optics. Reflection is the bouncing of light rays off a surface. The manner in which a ray of light is reflected depends on the angle at which it strikes the surface.
2732,"A ray striking a mirror perpendicularly is reflected 180° back upon itself, while a ray striking the mirror at a 45° angle is reflected 90°, and so on. Most of what we see is light that has been reflected off objects in our environment. Absorption is the transfer of light energy to a particle or surface."
2733,"You can feel this energy transfer on your skin on a sunny day, as visible light is absorbed and warms you up. Surfaces that appear black absorb the energy of all visible wavelengths. Some compounds absorb light energy only in a limited range of wavelengths and reflect the remaining wavelengths."
2734,"This property is the basis for the colored pigments of paints. For example, a blue pigment absorbs long wavelengths but reflects a range of short wavelengths centered on 430 nm, which are perceived as blue. Light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the retina contain pigments and use the energy absorbed from light to generate changes in membrane potential."
2735,"Images are formed in the eye by refraction, which is the bending of light rays that can occur when they travel from one transparent medium to another. Consider a ray of light passing from the air into a pool of water. If the ray strikes the water surface perpendicularly, it will pass through in a straight line."
2736,"However, if light strikes the surface at an angle, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the surface. This bending of light occurs because the speed of light differs in the two media; light passes through air more rapidly than through water. The greater the difference between the speed of light in the two media, the greater the angle of refraction."
2737,"The transparent media in the eye bend light rays to form images on the retina. The eye is an organ specialized for the detection, localization, and analysis of light. Here we introduce the structure of this remarkable organ in terms of its gross anatomy, ophthalmoscopic appearance, and cross-sectional anatomy."
2738,"When you look into someone’s eyes, what are you really looking at? The main structures are shown in the accompanying diagram."
2739,"The pupil is the opening that allows light to enter the eye and reach the retina; it appears dark because of the light-absorbing pigments in the retina. The pupil is surrounded by the iris, whose pigmentation provides what we call the eye’s color. The iris contains two muscles that can vary the size of the pupil; one makes it smaller when it contracts, while the other makes it larger."
2740,"The pupil and iris are covered by the glassy transparent external surface of the eye, known as the cornea. The cornea is continuous with the sclera, the ""white of the eye,"" which forms the tough wall of the eyeball. The eyeball sits in a bony eye socket in the skull, also called the eye’s orbit."
2741,"Inserted into the sclera are three pairs of extraocular muscles, which move the eyeball in the orbit. These muscles are normally not visible because they lie behind the conjunctiva, a membrane that folds back from the inside of the eyelids and attaches to the sclera. The optic nerve, carrying axons from the retina, exits the back of the eye, passes through the orbit, and reaches the base of the brain near the pituitary gland."
2742,"Another view of the eye is afforded by the ophthalmoscope, a device that enables one to peer into the eye through the pupil to the retina. The most obvious feature of the retina viewed through an ophthalmoscope is the blood vessels on its surface. These retinal vessels originate from a pale circular region called the optic disk, which is also where the optic nerve fibers exit the retina."
2743,"It is interesting to note that the sensation of light cannot occur at the optic disk because there are no photoreceptors there, nor can it occur where the large blood vessels exist because the vessels cast shadows on the retina. And yet, our perception of the visual world appears seamless. We are not aware of any holes in our field of vision because the brain fills in our perception of these areas."
2744,"However, there are tricks by which we can demonstrate the “blind” retinal regions. At the middle of each retina is a darker-colored region with a yellowish hue. This is the macula, the part of the retina for central vision."
2745,"Besides its color, the macula is distinguished by the relative absence of large blood vessels. Notice that the vessels arc from the optic disk to the macula; this is also the trajectory of the optic nerve fibers from the macula en route to the optic disk."
2746,"The relative absence of large blood vessels in this region of the retina is one of the specializations that improves the quality of central vision. Another specialization of the central retina can sometimes be discerned with the ophthalmoscope: the fovea, a dark spot about 2 mm in diameter. The term is from the Latin for “pit,” and the retina is thinner in the fovea than elsewhere."
2747,"Because it marks the center of the retina, the fovea is a convenient anatomical reference point. Thus, the part of the retina that lies closer to the nose than the fovea is called nasal, the part that lies near the temple is called temporal, the part of the retina above the fovea is called superior, and that below it is called inferior. A look through an ophthalmoscope reveals that there is a sizable hole in the retina."
2748,"The region where the optic nerve axons exit the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter the eye, the optic disk, is completely devoid of photoreceptors. Moreover, the blood vessels coursing across the retina are opaque and block the light from falling on photoreceptors beneath them. Although we normally don’t notice them, these blind regions can be demonstrated."
2749,"Look at the figure. Hold the book about 1.5 ft away, close your right eye, and fixate on the cross with your left eye."
2750,"Move the book around slightly, and eventually you will find a position where the black circle disappears. At this position, the spot is imaged on the optic disk of the left eye. This region of visual space is called the blind spot for the left eye."
2751,"The blood vessels are a little tricky to demonstrate, but give this a try. Get a standard household flashlight. In a dark or dimly lit room, close your left eye."
2752,"Look straight ahead with your open right eye and shine the flashlight at an angle into the corner of the eye from the side. Jiggle the light back and forth, up and down. If you’re lucky, you’ll see an image of your own retinal blood vessels."
2753,"This is possible because the illumination of the eye at this oblique angle causes the retinal blood vessels to cast long shadows on the adjacent regions of the retina. For the shadows to be visible, they must be swept back and forth on the retina, hence the jiggling of the light. If we have all these light-insensitive regions in the retina, why does the visual world appear uninterrupted and seamless?"
2754,The answer is that mechanisms in the visual cortex appear to “fill in” the missing regions. Perceptual filling-in can be demonstrated with the stimulus shown in Figure B. Fixate on the cross with your left eye and move the book closer and farther from your eye.
2755,"You’ll find a distance at which you will see a continuous, uninterrupted line. At this point, the space in the line is imaged on the blind spot, and your brain fills in the gap. A cross-sectional view of the eye shows the path taken by light as it passes through the cornea toward the retina."
2756,"The cornea lacks blood vessels and is nourished by the fluid behind it, the aqueous humor. This view reveals the transparent lens located behind the iris. The lens is suspended by ligaments attached to the ciliary muscles, which are attached to the sclera and form a ring inside the eye."
2757,"As we shall see, changes in the shape of the lens enable our eyes to adjust their focus to different viewing distances. The lens also divides the interior of the eye into two compartments containing slightly different fluids. The aqueous humor is the watery fluid that lies between the cornea and the lens."
2758,"The more viscous, jelly-like vitreous humor lies between the lens and the retina; its pressure serves to keep the eyeball spherical. Although the eyes do a remarkable job of delivering precise visual information to the rest of the brain, a variety of disorders can compromise this ability. The eye collects the light rays emitted by or reflected off objects in the environment and focuses them onto the retina to form images."
2759,"Bringing objects into focus involves the combined refractive powers of the cornea and lens. You may be surprised to learn that the cornea, rather than the lens, is the site of most of the refractive power of the eyes. Consider the light emitted from a distant source, perhaps a bright star at night."
2760,"We see the star as a point of light because the eye focuses the star’s light to a point on the retina. The light rays striking the surface of the eye from a distant star are virtually parallel, so they must be bent by the process of refraction. Recall that as light passes into a medium where its speed is slowed, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the border, or interface, between the media."
2761,This is precisely the situation as light strikes the cornea and passes from the air into the aqueous humor. The light rays that strike the curved surface of the cornea bend so that they converge on the back of the eye; those that enter the center of the eye pass straight to the retina.
2762,"The distance from the refractive surface to the point where parallel light rays converge is called the focal distance. Focal distance depends on the curvature of the cornea— the tighter the curve, the shorter the focal distance. The reciprocal of the focal distance in meters is a unit of measurement called the diopter. The cornea has a refractive power of about 42 diopters, which means that parallel light rays striking the corneal surface will be focused 0.024 m behind it, about the distance from the cornea to the retina."
2763,"To get a sense of the large amount of refraction produced by the cornea, note that many prescription eyeglasses have a power of only a few diopters. Remember that refractive power depends on the slowing of light at the air-cornea interface. If we replace air with a medium that passes light at about the same speed as the eye, the refractive power of the cornea will be eliminated."
2764,"This is why things look blurry when you open your eyes underwater; the water-cornea interface has very little focusing power. A scuba mask restores the air-cornea interface and, consequently, the refractive power of the eye. Although the cornea performs most of the eye’s refraction, the lens also contributes another dozen or so diopters to the formation of a sharp image at a distant point."
2765,"However, the lens is more important in forming crisp images of objects located closer than about 9 m from the eye. As objects approach, the light rays originating at a point can no longer be considered parallel. Rather, these rays diverge, and greater refractive power is required to bring them into focus on the retina."
2766,"This additional focusing power is provided by changing the shape of the lens, a process called accommodation. Once you know the basic structure of the eye, you can understand how a partial or complete loss of vision results from abnormalities in various components. For example, if there is an imbalance in the extraocular muscles of the two eyes, the eyes will point in different directions."
2767,"Such a misalignment or lack of coordination between the two eyes is called strabismus, and there are two varieties. In esotropia, the directions of gaze of the two eyes cross, and the person is said to be cross-eyed. In exotropia, the directions of gaze diverge, and the person is said to be walleyed."
2768,"In most cases, strabismus of either type is congenital; it can and should be corrected during early childhood. Treatment usually involves the use of prismatic glasses or surgery on the extraocular muscles to realign the eyes. Without treatment, conflicting images are sent to the brain from the two eyes, degrading depth perception and, more importantly, causing the person to suppress input from one eye."
2769,"The dominant eye will be normal, but the suppressed eye will become amblyopic, meaning that it has poor visual acuity. If medical intervention is delayed until adulthood, the condition cannot be corrected. A common eye disorder among older adults is cataract, a clouding of the lens."
2770,"Many people over 65 years of age have some degree of cataract; if it significantly impairs vision, surgery is usually required. In a cataract operation, the lens is removed and replaced with an artificial plastic lens. Although the artificial lens cannot adjust its focus like the normal lens, it provides a clear image, and glasses can be used for near and far vision."
2771,"Glaucoma, a progressive loss of vision associated with elevated intraocular pressure, is a leading cause of blindness. Pressure in the aqueous humor plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape of the eye. As this pressure increases, the entire eye is stressed, ultimately damaging the relatively weak point where the optic nerve leaves the eye."
2772,"The optic nerve axons are compressed, and vision is gradually lost from the periphery inward. Unfortunately, by the time a person notices a loss of more central vision, the damage is advanced, and a significant portion of the eye is permanently blind. For this reason, early detection and treatment with medication or surgery to reduce intraocular pressure are essential."
2773,"The light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye is the site of numerous disorders that pose a significant risk of blindness. You may have heard of a professional boxer having a detached retina. As the name implies, the retina pulls away from the underlying wall of the eye due to a blow to the head or by shrinkage of the vitreous humor."
2774,"Once the retina has started to detach, fluid from the vitreous space flows through small tears in the retina resulting from the trauma, thereby causing more of the retina to separate. Symptoms of retinal detachment include abnormal perception of shadows and flashes of light. Treatment often involves laser surgery to scar the edge of the retinal tear, thereby reattaching the retina to the back of the eye."
2775,"Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors. The first sign is usually a loss of peripheral vision and night vision. Subsequently, total blindness may result."
2776,"The cause of this disease is unknown. In some forms, it clearly has a strong genetic component, and more than 100 genes have been identified that can contain mutations leading to retinitis pigmentosa. There is currently no cure, but taking vitamin A may slow its progression."
2777,"In contrast to the tunnel vision typically experienced by patients with retinitis pigmentosa, people with macular degeneration lose only central vision. The condition is quite common, affecting more than 25% of all Americans over 65 years of age. While peripheral vision usually remains normal, the ability to read, watch television, and recognize faces is lost as central photoreceptors gradually deteriorate."
2778,"Laser surgery can sometimes minimize further vision loss, but the disease currently has no known cure. When the ciliary muscles are relaxed and the lens is flat, the eye is said to be emmetropic if parallel light rays from a distant point source are focused sharply on the back of the retina. Stated another way, the emmetropic eye focuses parallel light rays on the retina without the need for accommodation."
2779,"Now consider what happens when the eyeball is too short from front to back. The light rays are focused at some point behind the retina, and the image of a point of light is a blurry spot on the retina. This condition is known as hyperopia or farsightedness because the eye can focus on far objects, but the lens cannot accommodate enough to form an image on near points."
2780,"Farsightedness can be corrected by placing a convex glass or plastic lens in front of the eye. The curved front edge of the lens, like the cornea, bends light toward the center of the retina. Additionally, as the light passes from glass into air as it exits the lens, the back of the lens also increases the refraction."
2781,"If the eyeball is too long rather than too short, parallel rays will converge before the retina, cross, and again be imaged on the retina as a blurry circle. This condition is known as myopia or nearsightedness. The amount of refraction provided by the cornea and lens is too great to focus distant objects."
2782,"Thus, for the nearsighted eye to see distant points clearly, artificial concave lenses must be used to move the point image back onto the retina. Some eyes have irregularities such that the curvature and refraction in the horizontal and vertical planes are different. This condition is called astigmatism, and it can be corrected by using an artificial lens that is curved more along one axis than others."
2783,"Even if you are fortunate enough to have perfectly shaped eyeballs and a symmetrical refractive system, you probably will not escape presbyopia. This condition is a hardening of the lens that accompanies the aging process and is thought to be explained by the fact that while new lens cells are generated throughout life, none are lost. The hardened lens is less elastic, leaving it unable to change shape and accommodate sufficiently to focus on both near and far objects."
2784,"The correction for presbyopia, first introduced by Benjamin Franklin, is a bifocal lens. These lenses are concave on top to assist far vision and convex on the bottom to assist near vision. In hyperopia and myopia, the amount of refraction provided by the cornea is either too little or too great for the length of the eyeball."
2785,"But modern techniques can now change the amount of refraction the cornea provides. In radial keratotomy, a procedure to correct myopia, tiny incisions through the peripheral portion of the cornea relax and flatten the central cornea, thus reducing the amount of refraction and minimizing the myopia. The most recent techniques use lasers to reshape the cornea."
2786,"In photorefractive keratectomy, a laser is used to reshape the outer surface of the cornea by vaporizing thin layers. In laser in situ keratomileusis, a thin flap of the cornea is lifted so the laser can reshape the cornea from the inside. Nonsurgical methods are also being used to reshape the cornea."
2787,"A person can be fitted with special retainer contact lenses or plastic corneal rings, which alter the shape of the cornea and correct refractive errors. Recall that the ciliary muscle forms a ring around the lens. During accommodation, the ciliary muscle contracts and swells in size, thereby making the area inside the muscle smaller and decreasing the tension in the suspensory ligaments."
2788,"Consequently, the lens becomes rounder and thicker because of its natural elasticity. This rounding increases the curvature of the lens surfaces, thereby increasing their refractive power. Conversely, relaxation of the ciliary muscle increases the tension in the suspensory ligaments, and the lens is stretched into a flatter shape."
2789,"The ability to accommodate changes with age. An infant’s eyes can focus on objects just beyond his or her nose, whereas many middle-aged adults cannot clearly see objects closer than about arm’s length. Fortunately, artificial lenses can compensate for this and other defects of the eye’s optics."
2790,"In addition to the cornea and the lens, the pupil contributes to the optical functioning of the eye by continuously adjusting for different ambient light levels. To check this for yourself, stand in front of a bathroom mirror with the lights out for a few seconds, and then watch your pupils change size when you turn the lights on. This pupillary light reflex involves connections between the retina and neurons in the brainstem that control the muscles that constrict the pupils."
2791,"An interesting property of this reflex is that it is consensual; shining a light into only one eye causes the constriction of the pupils of both eyes. It is unusual, indeed, when the pupils are not the same size; the lack of a consensual pupillary light reflex is often taken as a sign of a serious neurological disorder involving the brainstem. Constriction of the pupil has the effect of increasing the depth of focus, just like decreasing the aperture size on a camera lens."
2792,"To understand why this is true, consider two points in space, one close and the other far away. When the eye accommodates to the closer point, the image of the farther point on the retina no longer forms a point, but rather a blurred circle. Decreasing the aperture—constricting the pupil—reduces the size of this blurred circle so that its image more closely approximates a point."
2793,"In this way, distant objects appear to be less out of focus. The structure of the eyes, and where they sit in our head, limits how much of the world we can see at any one time. Let’s investigate the extent of the space seen by one eye."
2794,"Holding a pencil in your right hand, close your left eye and look at a point straight ahead. Keeping your eye fixated on this point, slowly move the pencil to the right across your field of view until the pencil disappears. Repeat this exercise, moving the pencil to the left where it will disappear behind your nose, and then up and down."
2795,The points where you can no longer see the pencil mark the limits of the visual field for your right eye. Now look at the middle of the pencil as you hold it horizontally in front of you. Figure 9.
2796,"9 shows how the light reflected off this pencil falls on your retina. Notice that the image is inverted; the left visual field is imaged on the right side of the retina, and the right visual field is imaged on the left side of the retina. The ability of the eye to distinguish two nearby points is called visual acuity."
2797,"Acuity depends on several factors, but especially on the spacing of photoreceptors in the retina and the precision of the eye’s refraction. Distance across the retina can be described in terms of degrees of visual angle. A right angle subtends 90°, and the moon, for example, subtends an angle of about 0.5°. We can speak of the eye’s ability to resolve points that are separated by a certain number of degrees of visual angle. The Snellen eye chart, which we have all read at the doctor’s office, tests our ability to discriminate letters and numbers at a viewing distance of 20 feet."
2798,"Your vision is 20/20 when you can recognize a letter that subtends an angle of 0.083°. Now that we have an image formed on the retina, we can get to the neuroscience of vision: the conversion of light energy into neural activity."
2799,"To begin our discussion of image processing in the retina, we must introduce the cellular architecture of this part of the brain. The basic system of retinal information processing is shown in the diagram."
2800,"The most direct pathway for visual information to exit the eye is from photoreceptors to bipolar cells to ganglion cells. The ganglion cells fire action potentials in response to light, and these impulses propagate down the optic nerve to the rest of the brain. Besides the cells in this direct path from photoreceptor to brain, retinal processing is influenced by two additional cell types."
2801,"Horizontal cells receive input from the photoreceptors and project neurites laterally to influence surrounding bipolar cells and photoreceptors. Amacrine cells receive input from bipolar cells and project laterally to influence surrounding ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and other amacrine cells. There are two important points to remember here: the only light-sensitive cells in the retina are the photoreceptors."
2802,All other cells are influenced by light only via direct and indirect synaptic interactions with the photoreceptors. The ganglion cells are the only source of output from the retina. No other retinal cell type projects an axon through the optic nerve.
2803,Now let’s take a look at how the different cell types are arranged in the retina. The retina has a laminar organization: cells are organized in layers. Notice that the layers are seemingly inside-out; light must pass from the vitreous humor through the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before it reaches the photoreceptors.
2804,"Because the retinal cells above the photoreceptors are relatively transparent, image distortion is minimal as light passes through them. One reason the inside-out arrangement is advantageous is that the pigmented epithelium, which lies below the photoreceptors, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the photoreceptors and photopigments. The pigmented epithelium also absorbs any light that passes entirely through the retina, thus minimizing the reflection of light within the eye that would blur the image."
2805,"The cell layers of the retina are named in reference to the middle of the eyeball. Thus, the innermost layer is the ganglion cell layer, which contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells. Next is the inner nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells."
2806,"The next layer is the outer nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the photoreceptors. Finally, the layer of photoreceptor outer segments contains the light-sensitive elements of the retina. The outer segments are embedded in the pigmented epithelium."
2807,"Between the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer is the inner plexiform layer, which contains the synaptic contacts between bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells. Between the outer and inner nuclear layers is the outer plexiform layer, where the photoreceptors make synaptic contact with the bipolar and horizontal cells. The conversion of electromagnetic radiation into neural signals occurs in the 125 million photoreceptors at the back of the retina."
2808,"Every photoreceptor has four regions: an outer segment, an inner segment, a cell body, and a synaptic terminal. The outer segment contains a stack of membranous disks. Light-sensitive photopigments in the disk membranes absorb light, thereby triggering changes in the photoreceptor membrane potential."
2809,"Figure 9.13 shows the two types of photoreceptors in the retina, easily distinguished by the appearance of their outer segments. Rod photoreceptors have a long, cylindrical outer segment containing many discs."
2810,"Cone photoreceptors have a shorter, tapering outer segment with fewer membranous discs. The structural differences between rods and cones correlate with important functional differences. For example, the greater number of discs and higher photopigment concentration in rods makes them over 1,000 times more sensitive to light than cones."
2811,"Indeed, under nighttime lighting, or scotopic conditions, only rods contribute to vision. Conversely, under daytime lighting, or photopic conditions, cones do the bulk of the work. For this reason, the retina is said to be duplex—a scotopic retina using only rods, and a photopic retina using mainly cones."
2812,"Rods and cones differ in other respects as well. All rods contain the same photopigment, but there are three types of cones, each containing a different pigment. The variations among pigments make the different cones sensitive to different wavelengths of light."
2813,"As we shall see in a moment, only the cones, not the rods, are responsible for our ability to see color. Retinal structure varies from the fovea to the retinal periphery. In general, the peripheral retina has a higher ratio of rods to cones."
2814,"It also has a higher ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells. The combined effect of this arrangement is that the peripheral retina is more sensitive to light because rods are specialized for low light, and there are more photoreceptors feeding information to each ganglion cell. You can prove this to yourself on a starry night."
2815,"First, spend about 20 minutes in the dark getting oriented, and then gaze at a bright star. Fixating on this star, search your peripheral vision for a dim star. Then move your eyes to look at this dim star."
2816,You will find that the faint star disappears when it is imaged on the central retina but reappears when it is imaged on the peripheral retina. The same characteristics that enable the peripheral retina to detect faint stars at night make it relatively poor at resolving fine details in daylight. This is because daytime vision requires cones and because good visual acuity requires a low ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells.
2817,"The region of the retina most highly specialized for high-resolution vision is the fovea. Recall that the fovea is a thinning of the retina at the center of the macula. In cross-section, the fovea appears as a pit in the retina."
2818,"Its pit-like appearance is due to the lateral displacement of the cells above the photoreceptors, allowing light to strike the photoreceptors without passing through the other retinal cell layers. This structural specialization maximizes visual acuity at the fovea by pushing aside other cells that might scatter light and blur the image. The central fovea is also unique because it contains no rods; all the photoreceptors are cones."
2819,"The photoreceptors convert, or transduce, light energy into changes in membrane potential. We begin our discussion of phototransduction with rods, which outnumber cones in the human retina by 20 to 1. Most of what has been learned about phototransduction by rods has proven to be applicable to cones as well."
2820,"As we discussed in Part I, one way information is represented in the nervous system is as changes in the membrane potential of neurons. Thus, we look for a mechanism by which the absorption of light energy can be transduced into a change in the photoreceptor membrane potential. In many respects, this process is analogous to the transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals that occurs during synaptic transmission."
2821,"At a G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptor, for example, the binding of a transmitter to the receptor activates G-proteins in the membrane, which in turn stimulate various effector enzymes. These enzymes alter the intracellular concentration of cytoplasmic second messenger molecules, which change the conductance of membrane ion channels, thereby altering the membrane potential. Similarly, in the photoreceptor, light stimulation of the photopigment activates G-proteins, which in turn activate an effector enzyme that changes the cytoplasmic concentration of a second messenger molecule."
2822,"This change causes a membrane ion channel to close, and the membrane potential is thereby altered. Recall from Chapter 3 that a typical neuron at rest has a membrane potential of about -65 mV, close to the equilibrium potential for K+. In contrast, in complete darkness, the membrane potential of the rod outer segment is about -30 mV."
2823,"This depolarization is caused by the steady influx of Na+ through special channels in the outer segment membrane. The movement of positive charge across the membrane, which occurs in the dark, is called the dark current. Sodium channels are stimulated to open—are gated—by an intracellular second messenger called cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP."
2824,"Evidently, cGMP is continually produced in the photoreceptor by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, keeping the Na+ channels open. Light reduces cGMP, causing the Na+ channels to close, and the membrane potential becomes more negative. Thus, photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light."
2825,"The hyperpolarizing response to light is initiated by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the photopigment in the membrane of the stacked disks in the rod outer segments. In the rods, this pigment is called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin can be thought of as a receptor protein with a prebound chemical agonist."
2826,"The receptor protein is called opsin, and it has the seven transmembrane alpha helices typical of G-protein-coupled receptors throughout the body. The prebound agonist is called retinal, a derivative of vitamin A. The absorption of light causes a change in the conformation of retinal so that it activates the opsin."
2827,"This process is called bleaching because it changes the wavelengths absorbed by the rhodopsin. The bleaching of rhodopsin stimulates a G-protein called transducin in the disk membrane, which in turn activates the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase, which breaks down the cGMP that is normally present in the cytoplasm of the rod. The reduction in cGMP causes the Na+ channels to close and the membrane to hyperpolarize."
2828,"One of the interesting functional consequences of using a biochemical cascade for transduction is signal amplification. Many G-proteins are activated by each photopigment molecule, and each PDE enzyme breaks down more than one cGMP molecule. This amplification gives our visual system the ability to detect as little as a single photon, the elementary unit of light energy."
2829,"The complete sequence of events of phototransduction in rods is illustrated. In bright sunlight, cGMP levels in rods fall to the point where the response to light becomes saturated; additional light causes no more hyperpolarization. Thus, vision during the day depends entirely on the cones, whose photopigments require more energy to become bleached."
2830,"The process of phototransduction in cones is virtually the same as in rods; the only major difference is in the type of opsins in the membranous disks of the cone outer segments. The cones in our retinas contain one of three opsins that give the photopigments different spectral sensitivities. Thus, we can speak of “blue” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 430 nm, “green” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 530 nm, and “red” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 560 nm."
2831,"Color Detection. The color that we perceive is largely determined by the relative contributions of blue, green, and red cones to the retinal signal. The fact that our visual system detects colors in this way was actually predicted almost 200 years ago by British physicist Thomas Young."
2832,"Young showed in 1802 that all the colors of the rainbow, including white, could be created by mixing the proper ratio of red, green, and blue light. He proposed, quite correctly, that at each point in the retina there exists a cluster of three receptor types, each type being maximally sensitive to either blue, green, or red. Young’s ideas were later championed by Hermann von Helmholtz, an influential nineteenth-century German physiologist."
2833,"This theory of color vision came to be known as the Young-Helmholtz trichromacy theory. According to the theory, the brain assigns colors based on a comparison of the readout of the three cone types. When all types of cones are equally active, as in broad-spectrum light, we perceive “white.” Various forms of color blindness result when one or more of the cone photopigment types is missing. If cones alone make the perception of color possible, we should be unable to perceive color differences when cones are inactive. This inference is correct, and you can demonstrate it to yourself."
2834,"Go outside on a dark night and try to distinguish the colors of different objects. It is difficult to detect colors at night because only the rods, with a single type of photopigment, are activated under dim lighting conditions. The peak sensitivity of the rods is to a wavelength of about 500 nm, perceived as blue-green."
2835,"This fact is the basis for two points of view about the design of automobile dashboard indicator lights. One view is that the lights should be dim blue-green to take advantage of the spectral sensitivity of the rods. An alternate view is that the lights should be bright red because this wavelength affects mainly cones, leaving the rods unsaturated, resulting in better night vision."
2836,"This transition from all-cone daytime vision to all-rod nighttime vision is not instantaneous; it takes about 20–25 minutes. This phenomenon is called dark adaptation, or getting used to the dark. Sensitivity to light actually increases a millionfold or more during this period."
2837,"Dark adaptation is explained by a number of factors. Perhaps the most obvious is the dilation of the pupils, which allows more light to enter the eye. However, the diameter of the human pupil only ranges from about 2–8 mm, meaning that changes in its size can increase the pupil area by a factor of only 16."
2838,"The larger component of dark adaptation involves the regeneration of unbleached rhodopsin and an adjustment of the functional circuitry of the retina so that information from more rods is available to each ganglion cell. Because of this tremendous increase in sensitivity, when the dark-adapted eye goes back into bright light, it is temporarily saturated. This explains what happens when you first go outside on a bright day."
2839,"Over the next 5–10 minutes, the eyes undergo light adaptation, reversing the changes in the retina that accompanied dark adaptation. This light-dark adaptation in the duplex retina gives our visual system the ability to operate in light intensities ranging from moonless midnight to bright high noon."
2840,"In addition to the factors mentioned above, the ability of the eye to adapt to changes in light levels relies on changes in calcium concentration within the cones. When you step out into bright light from a dark theater, initially, the cones are hyperpolarized as much as possible. If the cones stayed in this state, we would be unable to see changes in light levels."
2841,"As we discussed above, the constriction of the pupil helps a bit in reducing the light entering the eye. However, the most important change is a gradual depolarization of the membrane back to about -35 mV. The reason this happens stems from the fact that the cGMP-gated sodium channels previously discussed also admit calcium."
2842,"In the dark, Ca²⁺ enters the cones and has an inhibitory effect on the enzyme that synthesizes cGMP. When the cGMP-gated channels close, the flow of Ca²⁺ into the photoreceptor is curtailed; as a result, more cGMP is synthesized, thereby allowing the cGMP-gated channels to open again. Stated more simply, when the channels close, a process is initiated that gradually reopens them even if the light level does not change."
2843,"Calcium also appears to affect photopigments and phosphodiesterase in ways that decrease their response to light. These calcium-based mechanisms ensure that the photoreceptors are always able to register relative changes in light levels, though information about the absolute level is lost. The color we perceive is largely determined by the relative amounts of light absorbed by the red, green, and blue visual pigments in our cones."
2844,"This means it is possible to perceive any color of the rainbow by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light. For example, the perception of yellow light can be matched by an appropriate mixture of red and green light. Because we use a ""three-color"" system, humans are referred to as trichromats."
2845,"However, not all normal trichromats perceive colors exactly the same. For example, if a group of people are asked to choose the wavelength of light that most appears green without being yellowish or bluish, there will be small variations in the choices. However, significant abnormalities of color vision extend well beyond this range of normal trichromatic vision."
2846,"Most abnormalities in color vision are the result of small genetic errors that lead to the loss of one visual pigment or a shift in the spectral sensitivity of one type of pigment. The most common abnormalities involve red-green color vision, and they are much more common in men than in women. The reason for this pattern is that the genes encoding the red and green pigments are on the X chromosome, whereas the gene that encodes the blue pigment is on chromosome 7."
2847,Men will have abnormal red-green vision if there is a defect on the single X chromosome they inherit from their mother. Women will have abnormal red-green vision only if both parents contribute abnormal X chromosomes. About 6% of men have a red or green pigment that absorbs somewhat different wavelengths of light than the pigments of the rest of the population.
2848,"These men are referred to as anomalous trichromats because they require somewhat different mixtures of red, green, and blue to see intermediate colors than other people do. Most anomalous trichromats have normal genes to encode the blue pigment and either the red or the green pigment, but they also have a hybrid gene that encodes a protein with an abnormal absorption spectrum between that of normal red and green pigments. For example, a person with an anomalous green pigment can match a yellow light with a red-green mixture containing less red than a normal trichromat."
2849,"Anomalous trichromats perceive the full spectrum of colors that normal trichromats perceive, but in rare instances, they will disagree about the precise color of an object. About 2% of men actually lack either the red or the green pigment, making them red-green color-blind. Because this leaves them with a “two-color” system, they are referred to as dichromats."
2850,"People lacking the green pigment are less sensitive to green, and they confuse certain red and green colors that appear different to trichromats. A “green dichromat” can match a yellow light with either red or green light; no mixture is needed. In contrast to the roughly 8% of men that are either missing one pigment or have an anomalous pigment, only about 1% of women have such color abnormalities."
2851,"People without one color pigment are considered colorblind, but they actually perceive quite a colorful world. Estimates of the number of people lacking all color vision vary, but less than about 0.001% of the population is thought to have this condition."
2852,"In one type, both red and green cone pigments are missing, in many cases because mutations of the red and green genes make them nonfunctional. These people are blue cone monochromats, and they live in a world that varies only in lightness, like a trichromat’s perception of a black-and-white movie. Recent research has shown that, precisely speaking, there may not be such a thing as normal color vision."
2853,"In a group of males classified as normal trichromats, it was found that some require slightly more red than others to perceive yellow in a red-green mixture. This difference, which is tiny compared to the deficits discussed above, results from a single alteration of the red pigment gene. The 60% of males who have the amino acid serine at site 180 in the red pigment gene are more sensitive to long-wavelength light than the 40% who have the amino acid alanine at this site."
2854,"Imagine what would happen if a woman had different red gene varieties on her two X chromosomes. Both red genes should be expressed, leading to different red pigments in two populations of cones. In principle, such women should have a form of tetrachromatic color vision, a rarity among all animals."
2855,"Well before the discovery of how photoreceptors work, researchers were able to explain some of the ways the retina processes visual images. Since about 1950, neuroscientists have studied the action potential discharges of retinal ganglion cells as the retina is stimulated with light. The pioneers of this approach were neurophysiologists Keffer Hartline, Stephen Kuffler, and Horace Barlow, with Hartline and Kuffler working in the United States and Barlow working in England."
2856,Their research uncovered which aspects of a visual image were encoded as ganglion cell output. Early studies of horseshoe crabs and frogs gave way to investigations of cats and monkeys. Researchers learned that similar principles are involved in retinal processing across a wide range of species.
2857,"Progress in understanding how ganglion cell properties are generated by synaptic interactions in the retina has been slower. This is because only ganglion cells fire action potentials; all other cells in the retina respond to stimulation with graded changes in membrane potential. The detection of such graded changes requires technically challenging intracellular recording methods, whereas action potentials can be detected using simple extracellular recording methods."
2858,"It was not until the early 1970s that John Dowling and Frank Werblin at Harvard University were able to show how ganglion cell responses are built from the interactions of horizontal and bipolar cells. The most direct path for information flow in the retina is from a cone photoreceptor to a bipolar cell to a ganglion cell. At each synaptic relay, the responses are modified by the lateral connections of horizontal cells and amacrine cells."
2859,"We first focus on how information is transformed as it passes from photoreceptors to bipolar cells and then explore ganglion cell output in the last section. Photoreceptors, like other neurons, release neurotransmitters when depolarized. The transmitter released by photoreceptors is the amino acid glutamate."
2860,"As we have seen, photoreceptors are depolarized in the dark and hyperpolarized by light. We thus have the counterintuitive situation in which photoreceptors actually release fewer transmitter molecules in the light than in the dark. However, we can reconcile this apparent paradox if we take the point of view that dark rather than light is the preferred stimulus for a photoreceptor."
2861,"Thus, when a shadow passes across a photoreceptor, it responds by depolarizing and releasing neurotransmitter. In the outer plexiform layer, each photoreceptor is in synaptic contact with two types of retinal neurons: bipolar cells and horizontal cells. Recall that bipolar cells create the direct pathway from photoreceptors to ganglion cells; horizontal cells feed information laterally in the outer plexiform layer to influence the activity of neighboring bipolar cells and photoreceptors."
2862,"Bipolar Cell Receptive Fields. Bipolar cells can be categorized into two classes, based on their responses to the glutamate released by photoreceptors. In OFF bipolar cells, glutamate-gated cation channels mediate a classical depolarizing EPSP from the influx of Na⁺."
2863,ON bipolar cells have G-protein-coupled receptors and respond to glutamate by hyperpolarizing. Notice that the terms OFF and ON refer to whether these cells depolarize in response to the light being off or to the light being on. Each bipolar cell receives direct synaptic input from a cluster of photoreceptors.
2864,"The number of photoreceptors in this cluster ranges from one at the center of the fovea to thousands in the peripheral retina. In addition to these direct connections with photoreceptors, bipolar cells are also connected via horizontal cells to a circumscribed ring of photoreceptors that surrounds this central cluster. The receptive field of a bipolar cell is the area of the retina that, when stimulated with light, changes the cell’s membrane potential."
2865,"The receptive field of a bipolar cell consists of two parts: a circular area of the retina providing direct photoreceptor input, called the receptive field center, and a surrounding area of the retina providing input via horizontal cells, called the receptive field surround. Receptive field dimensions can be measured in millimeters across the retina or, more commonly, in degrees of visual angle. One millimeter on the retina corresponds to a visual angle of about 3.5°. Bipolar cell receptive field diameters range from a fraction of a degree in the central retina to several degrees in the peripheral retina. The response of a bipolar cell’s membrane potential to light in the receptive field center is opposite to that of light in the surround."
2866,"For example, if illumination of the center causes depolarization of the bipolar cell, then illumination of the surround will cause an antagonistic hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell. Likewise, if the cell is depolarized by a spot turning from light to dark in the center of its receptive field, it will be hyperpolarized by the same dark stimulus applied to the surround. Thus, these cells are said to have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields."
2867,"The antagonistic surround appears to come from a complex interaction of horizontal cells, photoreceptors, and bipolar cells at their synapses. The center-surround receptive field organization is passed on from bipolar cells to ganglion cells via synapses in the inner plexiform layer. The lateral connections of the amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer also contribute to the elaboration of ganglion cell receptive fields and the integration of rod and cone input to ganglion cells."
2868,"Numerous types of amacrine cells have been identified, and their particular contributions to ganglion cell responses are still being investigated. The sole source of output from the retina to the rest of the brain is the action potentials arising from the million or so ganglion cells. The activity of these cells can be recorded electrophysiologically not only in the retina but also in the optic nerve where their axons travel."
2869,"Much of my scientific life has been spent studying the functional organization of the vertebrate retina—how the retinal cells are wired, how they respond when the retina is illuminated, and how the retina processes visual information. What led me to undertake this research? As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I worked in George Wald’s laboratory at Harvard."
2870,"Wald discovered the role of vitamin A in vision and had long been interested in photoreceptor mechanisms. With Wald, I studied the effects of vitamin A deficiency on photoreceptors, which brought me to the question of how visual sensitivity relates to visual pigment levels in photoreceptors. In other words, what mechanisms underlie the loss of visual sensitivity in vitamin A deficiency, and does this relate to the sensitivity changes that occur during light and dark adaptation?"
2871,"This early work was carried out in the rat, and I found there is a relationship between visual pigment levels and the logarithm of visual sensitivity in both vitamin A deficiency and during dark adaptation. Rat retinas, however, possess mainly rod photoreceptors, and an obvious next question was whether a similar relationship between visual pigment levels and light sensitivity holds also for cones. I decided to test this by switching to ground squirrels, whose retinas possess mainly cones."
2872,"Among other things, I was curious about how cone photoreceptors differ from rod photoreceptors, so I examined the ground squirrel photoreceptors by electron microscopy. What caught my eye one day were the cone synaptic terminals and the realization that I could follow an occasional process from a synaptic terminal back to its cell of origin. Bipolar cell branches extended to the synaptic terminals, as expected, but I could also identify horizontal cell processes synapsing with the photoreceptors! This was new and exciting."
2873,"Horizontal cells were very much a mystery then; indeed, some investigators thought they were glial cells, but the fact that they made synapses with the photoreceptors clearly indicated they were neurons. What, then, is the neuronal circuitry of the retina, and what is the role of the retinal interneurons—the horizontal and amacrine cells? This became an area of intense interest and study."
2874,"I joined forces with Brian Boycott, and we explored the cellular and synaptic organization of the outer and inner plexiform layers of the retina. We found that the photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals make ribbon synapses onto multiple postsynaptic targets, whereas amacrine cells and at least some horizontal cell processes make conventional synapses on single postsynaptic elements. In addition to ground squirrel retinas, we examined monkey, human, cat, frog, and goldfish retinas, and they all showed basic similarities in retinal wiring."
2875,"The next step was to record from the various retinal cells, and that work was undertaken in my laboratory by Frank Werblin, a graduate student with training in electrical engineering. We chose the mudpuppy retina as our animal because of its large cells, and soon Frank had recordings from all the retinal cell types. He confirmed the identity of the recorded cells by staining them intracellularly after the recording—a routine technique today, but then very difficult and on occasion messy."
2876,"More than once, Frank emerged from the darkroom where the experiments were carried out covered with the blue dye we then used. What those experiments told us was that there are both ON-center and OFF-center bipolar cells in the retina and that bipolar cells have a center-surround receptive field organization, with the horizontal cells accounting for the antagonistic surround response. Further, many amacrine cells respond transiently to illumination, giving ON-OFF responses, and appear to be involved in detecting movement."
2877,"These recordings, along with electron microscopic observations on the mudpuppy retina, enabled us to suggest the main pathways of information flow through the retina and the roles of the various cells and synapses. Many questions remained, many of which are being explored even today. However, being able to draw a diagram of the functional organization of the retina at that time, though imperfect and incomplete, was immensely satisfying, and it has encouraged, I like to believe, numerous additional studies on retinal mechanisms in the 35 years since."
2878,"Most retinal ganglion cells have the concentric center-surround receptive field organization discussed above for bipolar cells. ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cells receive input from the corresponding type of bipolar cell. Thus, an ON-center ganglion cell will be depolarized and respond with a barrage of action potentials when a small spot of light is projected onto the middle of its receptive field."
2879,"Likewise, an OFF-center cell will respond to a small dark spot presented to the middle of its receptive field. However, in both types of cells, the response to stimulation of the center is canceled by the response to stimulation of the surround. The surprising implication is that most retinal ganglion cells are not particularly responsive to changes in illumination that include both the receptive field center and the receptive field surround."
2880,"Rather, it appears that the ganglion cells are mainly responsive to differences in illumination that occur within their receptive fields. To illustrate this point, consider the response generated by an OFF-center cell as a light-dark edge crosses its receptive field. Remember that in such a cell, dark in the center of the receptive field causes the cell to depolarize, whereas dark in the surround causes the cell to hyperpolarize."
2881,"In uniform illumination, the center and surround cancel to yield some low level of response. When the edge enters the surround region of the receptive field without encroaching on the center, the dark area has the effect of hyperpolarizing the neuron, leading to a decrease in the cell’s firing rate. As the dark area begins to include the center, however, the partial inhibition by the surround is overcome, and the cell response increases."
2882,"But when the dark area finally fills the entire surround, the center response is again canceled. Notice that the cell response in this example is only slightly different in uniform light and in uniform dark; the response is modulated mainly by the presence of the light-dark edge in its receptive field. Now let’s consider the output of all the OFF-center ganglion cells that are stimulated by a stationary light-dark edge imaged on the retina."
2883,"The responses will fall into the same four categories illustrated. Thus, the cells that will register the presence of the edge are those with receptive field centers and surrounds that are differentially affected by the light and dark areas."
2884,"The population of cells with receptive field centers “viewing” the light side of the edge will be inhibited. The population of cells with centers “viewing” the dark side of the edge will be excited. In this way, the difference in illumination at a light-dark edge is not faithfully represented by the difference in the output of ganglion cells on either side of the edge."
2885,"Instead, the center-surround organization of the receptive fields leads to a neural response that emphasizes the contrast at light-dark edges. There are many visual illusions involving the perception of light level. The organization of ganglion cell receptive fields suggests an explanation for the illusion shown."
2886,"Even though the two central squares are the same shade of gray, the square on the left background appears darker. Consider the two ON-center receptive fields shown on the gray squares."
2887,"In both cases, the same gray light hits the receptive field center. However, the receptive field on the left has more light in its surround than the receptive field on the right. This will lead to a lower response and may be related to the darker appearance of the left gray square."
2888,"Most ganglion cells in the mammalian retina have a center-surround receptive field with either an ON or an OFF center. They can be further categorized based on their appearance, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. In the macaque monkey retina and human retina, two major types of ganglion cells are distinguished: large M-type ganglion cells and smaller P-type ganglion cells."
2889,"The relative sizes of M and P ganglion cells at the same location on the retina demonstrate that P cells constitute about 90% of the ganglion cell population, M cells constitute about 5%, and the remaining 5% is made up of a variety of nonM-nonP ganglion cell types that are less well characterized."
2890,"The visual response properties of M cells differ from those of P cells in several ways. They have larger receptive fields, they conduct action potentials more rapidly in the optic nerve, and they are more sensitive to low-contrast stimuli. In addition, M cells respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, while P cells respond with a sustained discharge as long as the stimulus is on."
2891,It will be shown that the different types of ganglion cells appear to play different roles in visual perception. Color-Opponent Ganglion Cells. Another important distinction between ganglion cell types is that some P cells and nonM-nonP cells are sensitive to differences in the wavelength of light.
2892,"The majority of these color-sensitive neurons are called color-opponent cells, reflecting the fact that the response to one wavelength in the receptive field center is canceled by showing another wavelength in the receptive field surround. Two types of opponency are found: red versus green and blue versus yellow. Consider, for example, a cell with a red ON center and a green OFF surround."
2893,"The center of the receptive field is fed mainly by red cones; therefore, the cell responds to red light by firing action potentials. Note that even a red light that bathes the entire receptive field is an effective stimulus. However, the response is reduced because red light has some effect on green cones that feed into the green OFF surround."
2894,"The response to red is only canceled by green light in the surround. Shorthand notation for such a cell is RG, meaning simply that it is excited by red in the receptive field center, and this response is inhibited by green in the surround. What would be the response to white light on the entire receptive field?"
2895,"Because white light contains all visible wavelengths, both center and surround would be equally activated, thereby canceling the response of the cell. Blue-yellow color opponency works the same way. Consider a cell with a blue ON center and a yellow OFF surround."
2896,"Blue light drives blue cones that feed the receptive field center, while yellow light activates both red and green cones that feed the surround. Again, diffuse blue light would be an effective stimulus for this cell, but yellow in the surround would cancel the response, as would diffuse white light. The lack of color opponency in M cells is accounted for by the fact that both the center and the surround of the receptive field receive input from more than one type of cone."
2897,"Perceived color is based on the relative activity of ganglion cells whose receptive field centers receive input from red, green, and blue cones. Demonstrate this to yourself by fixating on the cross in the middle of the red box for a minute or so."
2898,"This will have the effect of light-adapting some of your red cones. Then look at the white box. The activation of the green cones by the white light is unopposed, and you see a green square."
2899,"Similarly, if you fixate on the blue box, you will see yellow when you shift your gaze to the white box. Thus, it appears that the ganglion cells provide a stream of information to the brain that is involved in the spatial comparison of three different opposing processes: light versus dark, red versus green, and blue versus yellow. One of the important concepts that emerges from the discussion of the retina is the idea of parallel processing in the visual system."
2900,"Here’s why. First, we view the world with not one but two eyes that provide two parallel streams of information. In the central visual system, these streams are compared to give information about depth, the distance of an object from the observer."
2901,"Second, there appear to be independent streams of information about light and dark that arise from the ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cells in each retina. Third, ganglion cells of both ON and OFF varieties have different types of receptive fields and response properties. M cells can detect subtle contrasts over their large receptive fields and are likely to contribute to low-resolution vision."
2902,"P cells have small receptive fields that are well suited for the discrimination of fine detail. P cells and non-M-non-P cells are specialized for the separate processing of red-green and blue-yellow information. In this chapter, we have seen how light emitted by or reflected off objects in space can be imaged by the eye onto the retina."
2903,"Light energy is first converted into membrane potential changes in the mosaic of photoreceptors. It is interesting to note that the transduction mechanism in photoreceptors is very similar to that in olfactory receptor cells, both of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Photoreceptor membrane potential is converted into a chemical signal, which is again converted into membrane potential changes in the postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells."
2904,"This process of electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical signaling repeats again and again until the presence of light, dark, or color is finally converted to a change in the action potential firing frequency of the ganglion cells. The information from the 125 million photoreceptors is funneled into 1 million ganglion cells. In the central retina, particularly the fovea, relatively few photoreceptors feed each ganglion cell, whereas in the peripheral retina, thousands of receptors do."
2905,"Thus, the mapping of visual space onto the array of optic nerve fibers is not uniform. Rather, in “neural space,” there is an overrepresentation of the central few degrees of visual space, and signals from individual cones are more important. This specialization ensures high acuity in central vision but also requires that the eye move to bring the images of objects of interest onto the fovea."
2906,"As we shall see in the next chapter, there is good reason to believe that the different types of information that arise from different types of ganglion cells are, at least in the early stages, processed independently. Parallel streams of information—for example, from the right and left eyes—remain segregated at the first synaptic relay in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The same can be said for the M-cell and P-cell synaptic relays in the LGN."
2907,"In the visual cortex, it appears that parallel paths may process different visual attributes. For example, the distinction in the retina between neurons that do and do not convey information about color is preserved in the visual cortex. In general, each of the more than two dozen visual cortical areas may be specialized for the analysis of different types of retinal output."
2908,"Although our visual system provides us with a unified picture of the world around us, this picture has multiple facets. Objects we see have shape and color. They have position in space, and sometimes they move."
2909,"For us to see each of these properties, neurons somewhere in the visual system must be sensitive to them. Moreover, because we have two eyes, we actually have two visual images in our head, and somehow they must be merged. In many ways, the eye acts like a camera."
2910,"But starting with the retina, the rest of the visual system is far more elaborate, far more interesting, and capable of doing far more than any camera. For example, the retina does not simply pass along information about the patterns of light and dark that fall on it. Rather, the retina extracts information about different facets of the visual image."
2911,"There are more than 100 million photoreceptors in the retina but only 1 million axons leaving the eye carrying information to the rest of the brain. What we perceive about the world around us, therefore, depends on what information is extracted by the retina and how this information is analyzed and interpreted by the rest of the central nervous system. An example is color."
2912,"There is no such thing as color in the physical world; there is simply a spectrum of visible wavelengths of light that are reflected by objects around us. Based on the information extracted by the three types of cone photoreceptors, however, our brain somehow synthesizes a rainbow of colors and fills our world with it. In this chapter, we explore how the information extracted by the retina is analyzed by the central visual system."
2913,"The pathway serving conscious visual perception includes the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and the primary visual cortex, also called area 17, V1, or striate cortex. We will see that the information funneled through this geniculocortical pathway is processed in parallel by neurons specialized for the analysis of different stimulus attributes. The striate cortex then feeds this information to more than two dozen different extrastriate cortical areas in the temporal and parietal lobes, and many of these appear to be specialized for different types of analysis."
2914,"Much of what we know about the central visual system was first worked out in the domestic cat and then extended to the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. The macaque monkey, as it is also called, relies heavily on vision for survival in its habitat, as do we humans. In fact, tests of the performance of this primate’s visual system show that in virtually all respects, it rivals that of humans."
2915,"Thus, although most of this chapter concerns the organization of the macaque visual system, most neuroscientists agree that it approximates very closely the situation in our own brain. Although visual neuroscience cannot yet explain many aspects of visual perception, significant progress has been made in answering a more basic question: How do neurons represent the different facets of the visual world? By examining those stimuli that make different neurons in the visual cortex respond, and how these response properties arise, we begin to see how the brain portrays the visual world around us."
2916,"The neural pathway that leaves the eye, beginning with the optic nerve, is often referred to as the retinofugal projection. The suffix -fugal is from the Latin word meaning ""to flee"" and is commonly used in neuroanatomy to describe a pathway that is directed away from a structure. Thus, a centrifugal projection goes away from the center, a corticofugal projection goes away from the cortex, and the retinofugal projection goes away from the retina."
2917,"We begin our tour of the central visual system by looking at how the retinofugal projection courses from each eye to the brainstem on each side, and how the task of analyzing the visual world initially is divided among and organized within certain structures of the brainstem. Then we focus on the major arm of the retinofugal projection that mediates conscious visual perception. The ganglion cell axons “fleeing” the retina pass through three structures before they form synapses in the brainstem."
2918,"The components of this retinofugal projection are, in order, the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the optic tract. The optic nerves exit the left and right eyes at the optic disks, travel through the fatty tissue behind the eyes in their bony orbits, and then pass through holes in the floor of the skull. The optic nerves from both eyes combine to form the optic chiasm, which lies at the base of the brain, just anterior to where the pituitary gland hangs down."
2919,"At the optic chiasm, the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross from one side to the other. The crossing of a fiber bundle from one side of the brain to the other is called a decussation. Because only the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross, we say that a partial decussation of the retinofugal projection occurs at the optic chiasm."
2920,"Following the partial decussation at the optic chiasm, the axons of the retinofugal projections form the optic tracts, which run just under the pia along the lateral surfaces of the diencephalon. To understand the significance of the partial decussation of the retinofugal projection at the optic chiasm, let’s review the concept of the visual field. The full visual field is the entire region of space that can be seen with both eyes looking straight ahead."
2921,"Fix your gaze on a point straight ahead. Now imagine a vertical line passing through the fixation point, dividing the visual field into left and right halves. By definition, objects appearing to the left of the midline are in the left visual hemifield, and objects appearing to the right of the midline are in the right visual hemifield."
2922,"By looking straight ahead with both eyes open and then alternately closing one eye and then the other, you will see that the central portion of both visual hemifields is viewed by both retinas. This region of space is therefore called the binocular visual field. Notice that objects in the binocular region of the left visual hemifield will be imaged on the nasal retina of the left eye and on the temporal retina of the right eye."
2923,"Because the fibers from the nasal portion of the left retina cross to the right side at the optic chiasm, all the information about the left visual hemifield is directed to the right side of the brain. Remember this rule of thumb: optic nerve fibers cross in the optic chiasm so that the left visual hemifield is “viewed” by the right hemisphere and the right visual hemifield is “viewed” by the left hemisphere. A small number of optic tract axons peel off to form synaptic connections with cells in the hypothalamus, and another 10% or so continue past the thalamus to innervate the midbrain."
2924,But most of them innervate the lateral geniculate nucleus of the dorsal thalamus. The neurons in the LGN give rise to axons that project to the primary visual cortex. This projection from LGN to cortex is called the optic radiation.
2925,"Lesions anywhere in the retinofugal projection from eye to LGN to visual cortex cause blindness in humans. Therefore, we know that it is this pathway that mediates conscious visual perception. From our knowledge of how the visual world is represented in the retinofugal projection, we can predict the types of perceptual deficits that would result from its destruction at different levels, as might occur from a traumatic injury to the head, a tumor, or an interruption of the blood supply."
2926,"As shown in the example, while a transection of the left optic nerve would render a person blind in the left eye only, a transection of the left optic tract would lead to blindness in the right visual field as viewed through either eye. A midline transection of the optic chiasm would affect only the fibers that cross the midline."
2927,"Because these fibers originate in the nasal portions of both retinas, blindness would result in the regions of the visual field viewed by the nasal retinas, that is, the peripheral visual fields on both sides. Unique deficits result from lesions at different sites, so neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists can locate sites of damage by assessing visual field deficits. Nonthalamic Targets of the Optic Tract."
2928,"As we have said, some retinal ganglion cells send axons to innervate structures other than the LGN. Direct projections to part of the hypothalamus play an important role in synchronizing a variety of biological rhythms, including sleep and wakefulness, with the daily dark-light cycle. Direct projections to part of the midbrain, called the pretectum, control the size of the pupil and certain types of eye movement."
2929,"About 10% of the ganglion cells in the retina project to a part of the midbrain tectum called the superior colliculus. While 10% may not sound like much of a projection, bear in mind that in primates, this is about 150,000 neurons, which is equivalent to the total number of retinal ganglion cells in a cat! In fact, the tectum of the midbrain is the major target of the retinofugal projection in all nonmammalian vertebrates. In these vertebrate groups, the superior colliculus is called the optic tectum."
2930,"This is why the projection from the retina to the superior colliculus is often called the retinotectal projection, even in mammals. In the superior colliculus, a patch of neurons activated by a point of light, via indirect connections with motor neurons in the brainstem, commands eye and head movements to bring the image of this point in space onto the fovea. This branch of the retinofugal projection is thereby involved in orienting the eyes in response to new stimuli in the visual periphery."
2931,"We will return to the superior colliculus when we discuss motor systems in Chapter 14. Many of you are familiar with the famous story of David and Goliath, which appears in the Hebrew scriptures. The armies of the Philistines and the Israelites were gathered for battle when Goliath, a Philistine, came forth and challenged the Israelites to settle the dispute by sending out their best man to face him in a fight to the death."
2932,"Goliath, it seems, was a man of great proportions, measuring more than ""six cubits"" in height. If you consider that a cubit is the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, about 20 inches, this guy was more than 10 feet tall! Goliath was armed to the teeth with body armor, a javelin, and a sword. To face this giant, the Israelites sent David, a young and diminutive shepherd, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones."
2933,"Here’s how the action is described: When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. Now why, you might ask, are we giving a theology lesson in a neuroscience textbook?"
2934,"The answer is that our understanding of the visual pathway offers an explanation, in addition to divine intervention, for why Goliath was at a disadvantage in this battle. Body size is regulated by the secretion of growth hormone from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In some cases, the anterior lobe becomes hypertrophied and produces excessive amounts of the hormone, resulting in body growth to unusually large proportions."
2935,"Such individuals are called pituitary giants and can measure well over 8 feet tall. Pituitary hypertrophy also disrupts normal vision. Recall that the optic nerve fibers from the nasal retinas cross in the optic chiasm, which butts up against the stalk of the pituitary."
2936,"Any enlargement of the pituitary compresses these crossing fibers and results in a loss of peripheral vision called bitemporal hemianopia, or tunnel vision. We can speculate that David was able to draw close and strike Goliath because, when David raced to the battle line, the pituitary giant had completely lost sight of him. The right and left lateral geniculate nuclei, located in the dorsal thalamus, are the major targets of the two optic tracts."
2937,"Viewed in cross-section, each LGN appears to be arranged in six distinct layers of cells. By convention, the layers are numbered 1 through 6, starting with the most ventral layer, layer 1. In three dimensions, the layers of the LGN are arranged like a stack of six pancakes, one on top of the other."
2938,"The pancakes do not lie flat, however; they are bent around the optic tract like a knee joint. This shape explains the name geniculate, from the Latin geniculatus, meaning ""like a little knee."" The LGN is the gateway to the visual cortex and, therefore, to conscious visual perception."
2939,"Let’s explore the structure and function of this thalamic nucleus. LGN neurons receive synaptic input from the retinal ganglion cells, and most geniculate neurons project an axon to the primary visual cortex via the optic radiation. The segregation of LGN neurons into layers suggests that different types of retinal information are being kept separate at this synaptic relay, and indeed this is the case: Axons arising from M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells in the two retinas synapse on cells in different LGN layers."
2940,"Recall from our rule of thumb that the right LGN receives information about the left visual field. The left visual field is viewed by both the nasal left retina and the temporal right retina. At the LGN, input from the two eyes is kept separate."
2941,"In the right LGN, the right eye axons synapse on LGN cells in layers 2, 3, and 5. The left eye axons synapse on cells in layers 1, 4, and 6. A closer look at the LGN reveals that the two ventral layers, 1 and 2, contain larger neurons, and the four more dorsal layers, 3 through 6, contain smaller cells. The ventral layers are therefore called magnocellular LGN layers, and the dorsal layers are called parvocellular LGN layers. Recall that ganglion cells in the retina may also be classified into magnocellular and parvocellular groups."
2942,"As it turns out, P-type ganglion cells in the retina project exclusively to the parvocellular LGN, and M-type ganglion cells in the retina project entirely to the magnocellular LGN. In addition to the neurons in the six principal layers of the LGN, numerous tiny neurons also lie just ventral to each layer. Cells in these koniocellular layers receive input from the nonM-nonP types of retinal ganglion cells and also project to the visual cortex."
2943,"Note that the koniocellular layers are not uniquely numbered, because historically, the six thick layers were numbered before cells in the koniocellular layers were discovered. In the retina, M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells respond differently to light and color. In the LGN, the different information derived from the three categories of retinal ganglion cells from the two eyes remains segregated."
2944,"The anatomical organization of the LGN supports the idea that the retina gives rise to streams of information that are processed in parallel. This organization is summarized by inserting a microelectrode into the LGN; it is possible to study the action potential discharges of geniculate neurons in response to visual stimuli, just as was done in the retina."
2945,"The surprising conclusion of such studies is that the visual receptive fields of LGN neurons are almost identical to those of the ganglion cells that feed them. For example, magnocellular LGN neurons have relatively large center-surround receptive fields, respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, and are insensitive to differences in wavelength. All in all, they are just like M-type ganglion cells."
2946,"Likewise, parvocellular LGN cells, like P-type retinal ganglion cells, have relatively small center-surround receptive fields and respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a sustained increase in the frequency of action potentials; many of them exhibit color opponency. Receptive fields of cells in the koniocellular layers are center-surround and have either light/dark or color opponency. Within all layers of the LGN, the neurons are activated by only one eye, and ON-center and OFF-center cells are intermixed."
2947,"What makes the similarity of LGN and ganglion cell receptive fields so surprising is that the retina is not the main source of synaptic input to the LGN. The major input, constituting about 80% of the excitatory synapses, comes from the primary visual cortex. Thus, one might reasonably expect that this corticofugal feedback pathway would significantly alter the qualities of the visual responses recorded in the LGN."
2948,"So far, however, a role for this massive input has not been clearly identified. The LGN also receives synaptic inputs from neurons in the brain stem whose activity is related to alertness and attentiveness. Have you ever “seen” a flash of light when you are startled in a dark room?"
2949,"This perceived flash might be a result of the direct activation of LGN neurons by this pathway. Usually, however, this input does not directly evoke action potentials in LGN neurons. But it can powerfully modulate the magnitude of LGN responses to visual stimuli."
2950,"Thus, the LGN is more than a simple relay from retina to cortex; it is the first site in the ascending visual pathway where what we see is influenced by how we feel. The LGN has a single major synaptic target: the primary visual cortex. Recall that the cortex may be divided into a number of distinct areas based on their connections and cytoarchitecture."
2951,"Primary visual cortex is Brodmann’s area 17 and is located in the occipital lobe of the primate brain. Much of area 17 lies on the medial surface of the hemisphere, surrounding the calcarine fissure. Other terms used interchangeably to describe the primary visual cortex are V1 and striate cortex."
2952,"We have seen that the axons of different types of retinal ganglion cells synapse on anatomically segregated neurons in the LGN. In this section, we look at the anatomy of the striate cortex and trace the connections different LGN cells make with cortical neurons. In a later section, we explore how this information is analyzed by cortical neurons."
2953,"As we did in the LGN, in striate cortex we’ll see a close correlation between structure and function. The projection starting in the retina and extending to LGN and V1 illustrates a general organizational feature of the central visual system called retinotopy. Retinotopy is an organization whereby neighboring cells in the retina feed information to neighboring places in their target structures—in this case, the LGN and striate cortex."
2954,"In this way, the two-dimensional surface of the retina is mapped onto the two-dimensional surface of the subsequent structures. There are three important points to remember about retinotopy. First, the mapping of the visual field onto a retinotopically organized structure is often distorted because visual space is not sampled uniformly by the cells in the retina."
2955,"Recall that there are many more ganglion cells with receptive fields in or near the fovea than in the periphery. Thus, the representation of the visual field is distorted in the striate cortex: the central few degrees of the visual field are overrepresented, or magnified, in the retinotopic map. The second point to remember is that a discrete point of light can activate many cells in the retina, and often many more cells in the target structure, due to the overlap of receptive fields."
2956,"The image of a point of light on the retina actually activates a large population of cortical neurons; every neuron that contains that point in its receptive field is potentially activated. Thus, when the retina is stimulated by a point of light, the activity in the striate cortex is a broad distribution with a peak at the corresponding retinotopic location. Finally, don’t be misled by the word “map.” There are no pictures in the primary visual cortex for a little person in our brain to look at. While it’s true that the arrangement of connections establishes a mapping between the retina and V1, perception is based on the brain’s interpretation of distributed patterns of activity, not literal snapshots of the world. The neocortex in general, and striate cortex in particular, have neuronal cell bodies arranged into about a half-dozen layers."
2957,"These layers can be seen clearly in a Nissl stain of the cortex, which, as described in Chapter 2, leaves a deposit of dye in the soma of each neuron. Starting at the white matter, the cell layers are named by Roman numerals VI, V, IV, III, and II. Layer I, just under the pia mater, is largely devoid of neurons and consists almost entirely of axons and dendrites of cells in other layers."
2958,"The full thickness of the striate cortex from white matter to pia is about 2 mm, the height of the lowercase letter m. As described, characterizing the lamination of the striate cortex as a six-layer scheme is somewhat misleading."
2959,"There are actually at least nine distinct layers of neurons. To maintain Brodmann’s convention that neocortex has six layers, however, neuroanatomists combine three sublayers into layer IV, labeled IVA, IVB, and IVC. Layer IVC is further divided into two tiers called IVC₁ and IVC₂."
2960,"The anatomical segregation of neurons into layers suggests that there is a division of labor in the cortex, similar to what we saw in the LGN. We can learn a lot about how the cortex handles visual information by examining the structure and connections of its different layers."
2961,"Many different neuronal shapes have been identified in the striate cortex, but here we focus on two principal types, defined by the appearance of their dendritic trees. Spiny stellate cells are small neurons with spine-covered dendrites that radiate out from the cell body. They are seen primarily in the two tiers of layer IVC."
2962,Outside layer IVC are many pyramidal cells. These neurons are also covered with spines and are characterized by a single thick apical dendrite that branches as it ascends toward the pia mater and by multiple basal dendrites that extend horizontally. Notice that a pyramidal cell in one layer may have dendrites extending into other layers.
2963,"It is important to remember that only pyramidal cells send axons out of the striate cortex to form connections with other parts of the brain. The axons of stellate cells make local connections only within the cortex. In addition to the spiny neurons, inhibitory neurons, which lack spines, are scattered in all cortical layers as well."
2964,"These neurons form only local connections. The distinct lamination of the striate cortex is reminiscent of the layers we saw in the LGN. In the LGN, every layer receives retinal afferents and sends efferents to the visual cortex."
2965,"In the visual cortex, the situation is different; only a subset of the layers receives input from the LGN or sends output to a different cortical or subcortical area. Axons from the LGN terminate in several different cortical layers, with the largest number going to layer IVC. The output of the LGN is divided into streams of information, for example, from the magnocellular and parvocellular layers serving the right and left eyes."
2966,"These streams remain anatomically segregated in layer IVC. Magnocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC, and parvocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC. Imagine that the two tiers of layer IVC are pancakes, stacked one on top of the other."
2967,"Because the input from the LGN to the cortex is arranged topographically, layer IVC contains two overlapping retinotopic maps, one from the magnocellular LGN and the other from the parvocellular LGN. Koniocellular LGN axons follow a different path, bypassing layer IV to make synapses in layers II and III. Ocular Dominance Columns."
2968,How are the left eye and right eye LGN inputs segregated when they reach layer IVC of the striate cortex? The answer was provided by a groundbreaking experiment performed in the early 1970s at Harvard Medical School by neuroscientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. They injected a radioactive amino acid into one eye of a monkey.
2969,"This amino acid was incorporated into proteins by the ganglion cells, and the proteins were transported down the ganglion cell axons into the LGN. Here, the radioactive proteins spilled out of the ganglion cell axon terminals and were taken up by nearby LGN neurons. But not all LGN cells took up the radioactive material; only those cells that were postsynaptic to the inputs from the injected eye incorporated the labeled protein."
2970,"These cells then transported the radioactive proteins to their axon terminals in layer IVC of the striate cortex. The location of the radioactive axon terminals was visualized by first placing a film of emulsion over thin sections of the striate cortex and later developing the emulsion like a photograph, a process called autoradiography. The resulting collection of silver grains on the film marked the location of the radioactive LGN inputs."
2971,"In sections cut perpendicular to the cortical surface, Hubel and Wiesel observed that the distribution of axon terminals relaying information from the injected eye was not continuous in layer IVC, but rather was split up into a series of equally spaced patches, each about 0.5 mm wide. These patches were termed ocular dominance columns."
2972,"In later experiments, the cortex was sectioned tangentially, parallel to layer IV. This revealed that the left eye and right eye inputs to layer IV are laid out as a series of alternating bands, like the stripes of a zebra. Innervation of Other Cortical Layers from Layer IVC."
2973,"Most intracortical connections extend perpendicular to the cortical surface along radial lines that run across the layers, from white matter to layer I. This pattern of radial connections maintains the retinotopic organization established in layer IV. Therefore, a cell in layer VI, for example, receives information from the same part of the retina as a cell above it in layer IV."
2974,"However, the axons of some layer III pyramidal cells extend collateral branches that make horizontal connections within layer III. Radial and horizontal connections play different roles in the analysis of the visual world, as will be seen later in the chapter. Layer IVC stellate cells project axons radially up mainly to layers IVB and III, where, for the first time, information from the left eye and right eye begins to mix."
2975,"Whereas all layer IVC neurons receive only monocular input, most neurons in layers II and III receive binocular input coming from both eyes. Even so, there continues to be considerable anatomical segregation of the magnocellular and parvocellular processing streams. Layer IVC, which receives magnocellular LGN input, projects mainly to cells in layer IVB."
2976,"Layer IVC, which receives parvocellular LGN input, projects mainly to layer III. In layers III and IVB, an axon may form synapses with the dendrites of pyramidal cells of all layers. Striate cortex outputs."
2977,"As previously mentioned, the pyramidal cells send axons out of the striate cortex into the white matter. The pyramidal cells in different layers innervate different structures. Layer II, III, and IVB pyramidal cells send their axons to other cortical areas."
2978,Layer V pyramidal cells send axons all the way down to the superior colliculus and pons. Layer VI pyramidal cells give rise to the massive axonal projection back to the LGN. Pyramidal cell axons in all layers also branch and form local connections in the cortex.
2979,"As we have seen, layers II and III play a key role in visual processing, providing most of the information that leaves V1 for other cortical areas. Anatomical studies suggest that the V1 output comes from two distinct populations of neurons in the superficial layers. When the striate cortex is stained to reveal the presence of cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme used for cell metabolism, the stain is not uniformly distributed in layers II and III."
2980,"Rather, the cytochrome oxidase staining in cross-sections of the striate cortex appears as a colonnade, a series of pillars at regular intervals, running the full thickness of layers II and III and also in layers V and VI. When the cortex is sliced tangentially through layer III, these pillars appear like the spots of a leopard. These pillars of cytochrome oxidase-rich neurons have come to be called blobs."
2981,"The blobs are in rows, each blob centered on an ocular dominance stripe in layer IV. Between the blobs are ""interblob"" regions. The blobs receive direct LGN input from the koniocellular layers, as well as parvocellular and magnocellular input from layer IVC of the striate cortex."
2982,"Beginning in the early 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel were the first to systematically explore the physiology of the striate cortex with microelectrodes. They were students of Stephen Kuffler, who was then at Johns Hopkins University and later moved with them to Harvard. They extended Kuffler’s innovative methods of receptive field mapping to the central visual pathways."
2983,"After showing that LGN neurons behave much like retinal ganglion cells, they turned their attention to the striate cortex, initially in cats and later in monkeys. The work that continues today on the physiology of the striate cortex is built on the solid foundation provided by Hubel and Wiesel’s pioneering studies. Their contributions to our understanding of the cerebral cortex were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 1981."
2984,"By and large, the receptive fields of neurons in layer IVC are similar to the magnocellular and parvocellular LGN neurons providing their input. This means they are generally small monocular center-surround receptive fields. In layer IVC, the neurons are insensitive to the wavelength of light, whereas in layer IVC the neurons exhibit center-surround color opponency."
2985,"In the outer layer IVC, new receptive field characteristics, not observed in the retina or LGN, are found. We will explore these in some depth, as they provide clues about the role V1 plays in visual processing and perception. Binocularity."
2986,Each neuron in layers IVC and IVC3 receives afferents from a layer of the LGN representing either eye. Monocular neurons from either eye are also clumped together in V1 rather than randomly intermixed. This accounts for ocular dominance columns that can be visualized in layer IVC with autoradiography.
2987,"As we have already seen, the axons leaving layer IVC diverge and innervate more superficial cortical layers. As a consequence of the divergence, there is a mixing of inputs from the two eyes. Microelectrode recordings confirm this anatomical fact; most neurons in layers superficial to IVC are binocular, responding to light in either eye."
2988,"We say that the neurons have binocular receptive fields, meaning that they actually have two receptive fields, one in the ipsilateral and one in the contralateral eye. The construction of binocular receptive fields is essential in binocular animals, such as humans. Without binocular neurons, we would probably be unable to use the inputs from both eyes to form a single image of the world around us."
2989,"Retinotopy is preserved because the two receptive fields of a binocular neuron are precisely placed on the retinas such that they are “looking” at the same point in space. We still speak of ocular dominance columns in superficial cortical layers. However, now instead of the sharp monocular columns of layer IVC, there are patches of neurons that are more strongly driven by one eye than the other, even though they are binocular."
2990,"Orientation Selectivity. Most of the receptive fields in the retina, LGN, and layer IVC are circular and respond maximally to a spot of light matched in size to the receptive field center. Outside layer IVC, we encounter cells that no longer follow this pattern."
2991,"While small spots can elicit a response from many cortical neurons, it is usually possible to produce a much greater response with other stimuli. By chance, Hubel and Wiesel found that many neurons in V1 respond best to an elongated bar of light moving across their receptive fields. However, the orientation of the bar is critical."
2992,The greatest response is given to a bar with a particular orientation; perpendicular bars generally elicit much weaker responses. Neurons having this type of response are said to exhibit orientation selectivity. Most of the V1 neurons outside layer IVC are orientation selective.
2993,"The optimal orientation for a neuron can be any angle around the clock. If V1 neurons can have any optimal orientation, you might wonder whether the orientation selectivity of nearby neurons is related. From the earliest work of Hubel and Wiesel, the answer to this question is an emphatic yes."
2994,"As a microelectrode is advanced radially from one layer to the next, the preferred orientation remains the same for all the selective neurons encountered from layer II down through layer VI. Hubel and Wiesel called such a radial column of cells an orientation column. As an electrode passes tangentially through the cortex in a single layer, the preferred orientation progressively shifts."
2995,"We now know, from the use of a technique called optical imaging, that there is a mosaic-like pattern of optimal orientations in the striate cortex. If an electrode is passed at certain angles through this mosaic, the preferred orientation rotates like the sweep of the minute hand of a clock, from the top of the hour to ten past to twenty past, and so on. If the electrode is moved at other angles, more sudden shifts in preferred orientation occur."
2996,"Hubel and Wiesel found that a complete 180° shift in preferred orientation required a traverse of about 1 mm, on average, within layer III. The analysis of stimulus orientation appears to be one of the most important functions of the striate cortex. Orientation-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object shape."
2997,Direction Selectivity. Many V1 receptive fields exhibit direction selectivity; they respond when a bar of light at the optimal orientation moves perpendicular to the orientation in one direction but not in the opposite direction. Direction-selective cells in V1 are a subset of the cells that are orientation selective.
2998,"Figure 10.22 shows how a direction-selective cell responds to a moving stimulus. Notice that the cell responds to an elongated stimulus swept across the receptive field, but only in a particular direction of movement."
2999,Sensitivity to the direction of stimulus motion is a hallmark of neurons receiving input from the magnocellular layers of the LGN. Direction-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object motion.
3000,"Simple and Complex Receptive Fields. Neurons in the LGN have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields, and this organization accounts for the responses of neurons to visual stimuli. For example, a small spot in the center of the receptive field may yield a much stronger response than a larger spot also covering the antagonistic surround. What do we know about the inputs to V1 neurons that might account for binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity in their receptive fields?"
3001,"Binocularity is easy; we have seen that binocular neurons receive afferents from both eyes. The mechanisms underlying orientation and direction selectivity have proven more difficult to elucidate. Many orientation-selective neurons have a receptive field elongated along a particular axis, with an ON-center or OFF-center region flanked on one or both sides by an antagonistic surround."
3002,This linear arrangement of ON and OFF areas is analogous to the concentric antagonistic areas seen in retinal and LGN receptive fields. One gets the impression that the cortical neurons receive a converging input from three or more LGN cells with receptive fields that are aligned along one axis. Hubel and Wiesel called neurons of this type simple cells.
3003,"The segregation of ON and OFF regions is a defining property of simple cells, and it is because of this receptive field structure that they are orientation selective. Other orientation-selective neurons in V1 do not have distinct ON and OFF regions and are therefore not considered simple cells. Hubel and Wiesel called most of these complex cells because their receptive fields appeared to be more complex than those of simple cells."
3004,"Complex cells give ON and OFF responses to stimuli throughout the receptive field. Hubel and Wiesel proposed that complex cells are constructed from the input of several like-oriented simple cells. However, this remains a matter of debate."
3005,"Simple and complex cells are typically binocular and sensitive to stimulus orientation. While less is known about the mechanism, many are also direction-selective. In general, they are relatively insensitive to the wavelength of light, although color sensitivity is sometimes observed."
3006,"Blob Receptive Fields. The old adage says, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This idea appropriately describes the connection between structure and function in the brain."
3007,"We have seen repeatedly in the visual system that when two nearby structures label differently with some anatomical technique, there is good reason to suspect the neurons in the structures are functionally different. For example, we have seen how the distinctive layers of the LGN segregate different types of input. Similarly, the lamination of the striate cortex correlates with differences in the receptive fields of the neurons."
3008,"The presence of the distinct cytochrome oxidase blobs outside layer IV of the striate cortex immediately raises the question of whether the neurons in the blobs respond differently from interblob neurons. The answer is clearly yes. The neurons in the interblob areas have some or all of the properties we discussed above: binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity."
3009,"They are both simple cells and complex cells and generally are not wavelength sensitive. Most blob cells, on the other hand, are wavelength sensitive and monocular, and they lack orientation and direction selectivity. The blobs receive input directly from the koniocellular layers of the LGN and magnocellular and parvocellular input via layer IVC."
3010,The visual responses of blob cells most resemble those of the koniocellular and parvocellular input. The receptive fields of most blob neurons are circular. Some have the color-opponent center-surround organization observed in the parvocellular and koniocellular layers of the LGN.
3011,"Other blob cell receptive fields have red-green or blue-yellow color opponency in the center of their receptive fields, with no surround regions at all. Still other cells have both a color-opponent center and a color-opponent surround; they are called double-opponent cells. For present purposes, the most important thing to remember about blobs is that they contain the great majority of color-sensitive neurons outside layer IVC."
3012,"Thus, the blob channels appear to be specialized for the analysis of object color. Without them, we might be color-blind. Most of what we know about the response properties of neurons in the visual system, and every other system in the brain, has been learned from intracellular and extracellular recordings with microelectrodes."
3013,"These recordings give precise information about the activity of one or a few cells. However, unless one inserts thousands of electrodes, it is not possible to observe patterns of activity across large populations of neurons. What if we could simultaneously record signals from thousands of neurons simply by aiming a camera at the brain’s surface?"
3014,"Incredibly, one can observe brain activity with this optical recording approach, and the resulting images have yielded new insight about the organization of the cerebral cortex. In one version of optical recording, a voltage-sensitive dye is applied to the surface of the brain. The molecules in the dye bind to cell membranes, and they change their optical properties in proportion to variations in membrane potential."
3015,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
3016,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons."
3017,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
3018,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
3019,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Further, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally."
3020,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by the neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
3021,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is in fact comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
3022,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
3023,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
3024,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from the neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
3025,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, DorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing VentroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include Anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, Posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
3026,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
3027,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
3028,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
3029,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
3030,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
3031,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we have now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
3032,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
3033,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
3034,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
3035,"DN1pC and DN1pE each consist of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD consists of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD comprises two morphologically distinct subtypes."
3036,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is in fact morphologically similar to the DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
3037,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
3038,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
3039,"Similarly, the two DN2 neurons are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
3040,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 neurons cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected, since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
3041,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
3042,"Nonetheless, the synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with those determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than 4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than 9 synapses as strong connections."
3043,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with prior reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
3044,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
3045,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
3046,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
3047,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
3048,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
3049,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
3050,"Taken together, our analyses revealed previously unknown connectivity between the clock neurons that could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in advancing our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
3051,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
3052,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
3053,"While post-synaptic signals were not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
3054,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated postsynaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 driver, and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
3055,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
3056,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
3057,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
3058,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells that provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
3059,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
3060,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ and ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
3061,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
3062,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
3063,"Regardless, we found little direct input from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings that revealed most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized the indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
3064,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets via aMe3/aMe6a to APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
3065,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to greater than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
3066,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
3067,"Furthermore, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
3068,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of greater than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
3069,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in approximately 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
3070,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
3071,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Furthermore, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual-projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
3072,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
3073,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons, which could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
3074,"These descending neurons include those that have not yet been classified, as well as allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
3075,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
3076,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
3077,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells that influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
3078,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
3079,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves, and depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
3080,"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC, in agreement with our companion studies."
3081,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
3082,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
3083,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs."
3084,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
3085,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
3086,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
3087,"Thus, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
3088,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receives inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
3089,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derives from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
3090,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
3091,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways. Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines would yield important insights. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
3092,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the ""DN1p CNMa & AstC"" cluster, which coexpresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
3093,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters, including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody or DH44-T2A-Gal4."
3094,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
3095,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
3096,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
3097,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
3098,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
3099,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
3100,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
3101,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
3102,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
3103,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cutoff of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
3104,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
3105,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
3106,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
3107,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
3108,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
3109,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters while excluding l-LNv, and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN neurons in fact represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
3110,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
3111,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
3112,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2, are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
3113,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
3114,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents the decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and, to a lesser extent, by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
3115,"In addition, consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
3116,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
3117,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks: Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
3118,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
3119,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
3120,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
3121,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
3122,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock: Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
3123,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii, have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
3124,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach: The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
3125,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of more than 4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and they can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
3126,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways that could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
3127,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
3128,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
3129,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
3130,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
3131,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies."
3132,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs and silenced each of the Drosophila feeding initiation circuits because they have well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
3133,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
3134,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
3135,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
3136,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum and the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
3137,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
3138,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
3139,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
3140,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
3141,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
3142,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
3143,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
3144,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
3145,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
3146,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
3147,"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
3148,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
3149,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
3150,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
3151,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
3152,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to differ from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
3153,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
3154,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the predictions of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
3155,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
3156,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 was activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activated them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
3157,"When we activated each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 were predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of these 11 cell types actually elicited rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 had non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, resulted in the addition of five false positives."
3158,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types were predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five, or six, did indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
3159,"We first tested whether the model could predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
3160,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
3161,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs was sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
3162,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension response to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
3163,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension, but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
3164,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
3165,"We found that the activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
3166,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
3167,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
3168,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
3169,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
3170,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
3171,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
3172,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments, combined with previous experiments, confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
3173,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
3174,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
3175,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
3176,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that the activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
3177,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
3178,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
3179,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated as JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
3180,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
3181,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for the activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
3182,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1, a descending member of the BN2 class, and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
3183,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
3184,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
3185,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
3186,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
3187,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
3188,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
3189,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in these circuits."
3190,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models: we implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
3191,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
3192,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length, rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
3193,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
3194,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
3195,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits with extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
3196,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Drosophila taste coding: Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
3197,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger impinges primarily at sugar-sensing neurons and at select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery and then funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
3198,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling, in general, is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
3199,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
3200,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains but does not dictate a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
3201,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
3202,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
3203,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
3204,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clocks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
3205,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and recently in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may derive from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also due to a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
3206,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven CCRs. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
3207,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays affected by environmental light and by non-cell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we start by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
3208,"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods allowed us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
3209,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations."
3210,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
3211,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results: The Rhythms of Slow and Fast Calcium Activity Changes Show Similar Daily Patterns."
3212,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
3213,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1 and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are in fact distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
3214,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
3215,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of ""fast"" calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
3216,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
3217,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable to those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
3218,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
3219,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of the photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
3220,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
3221,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
3222,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
3223,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ lifespans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
3224,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require inositol trisphosphate receptor."
3225,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
3226,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely arrhythmic."
3227,"The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely arrhythmic when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
3228,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
3229,"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-hour light:12-hour dark time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies. Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
3230,"Fast calcium fluctuations require α1T calcium channels and ITPR. Knocking down the RNA for α1T voltage-gated calcium channels in pacemaker neurons impaired circadian rhythms in behavior but did not affect circadian rhythmicity in basal calcium levels within those neurons. Therefore, we next asked whether α1T may underlie the circadian rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations in pacemakers."
3231,"To test this, we again performed imaging across a series of short-term high-frequency calcium measurements on the same flies for a 24-hour day with 1-hour intervals. By comparing control Drosophila with those with α1T knocked down in all circadian pacemaker neurons by tim-GAL4, we found that knocking down α1T did not affect the daily rhythms in the basal calcium level in any pacemaker group except for the DN1, which showed a reduction in the day-night difference of the basal calcium level. These high-frequency measures of slow basal calcium levels largely conform with those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions."
3232,"However, the high-frequency recording revealed that fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the α1T knockdown flies, except for l-LNv. That specific pacemaker group instead displayed higher levels of fast calcium fluctuations. These results indicated that, at least in the majority of circadian pacemaker neurons, α1T is required for strong daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations and that the rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations can be selectively impaired."
3233,"We then asked whether the fast calcium fluctuations are also affected in flies with Itpr knocked down in all pacemaker neurons. We performed the same high-frequency calcium imaging and analysis in Itpr knockdown flies as in α1T knockdown flies. The daily variation of pacemaker calcium was greatly reduced in Itpr knockdown flies, which largely recapitulated previous observations with less frequent sampling."
3234,"In addition, fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the Itpr knockdown flies. These results suggested that rhythms in basal calcium levels, regulated by ITPR, may be necessary for rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations. In this study, we used in vivo 24-hour high-frequency calcium imaging and genetic screening to study the cellular biology of daily calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons of Drosophila."
3235,"We found that the calcium rhythm is, in fact, a composite; it reflects daily fluctuations in both a slow component and a fast one. We interpret fast calcium fluctuations as representations of calcium dynamics that occur as neurons fire single action potentials or bursts of them. While it is not sufficient to resolve single action potentials, GCaMP6-induced fluorescence is a good index of neuronal electrical activity."
3236,"For individual identified pacemakers, these two calcium rhythms share the same daily pattern, yet distinct calcium sources appear to contribute differentially to these two rhythms. An extracellular calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium channels that include the α1T subunit is critical for the fast calcium fluctuations. In contrast, calcium fluxes from the endoplasmic reticulum via the channel ITPR are required for both the slow rhythms in the basal calcium levels and the fast ones."
3237,"Importantly, both channels are essential for normal circadian behavior. Thus, the molecular clocks may drive circadian rhythms in pacemaker neuron output by regulating different calcium sources to generate coordinated but distinct rhythms in its calcium activities. Calcium rhythms are widespread across taxa."
3238,"Calcium rhythms are required for circadian pacemaker functions in both rodents and Drosophila. Studies on mammalian circadian pacemakers in the SCN are controversial regarding the temporal relationship between the calcium rhythms and rhythms in electrical activity, such as in spontaneous firing rate and in resting membrane potential. Recordings from SCN slice cultures showed that the phases of calcium rhythms in individual pacemakers are diverse and could be different from the population phase of spontaneous firing rate rhythms."
3239,"However, the population spontaneous firing rate phase is composed of many diverse phases of spontaneous firing rate rhythms at the individual cell level; it is unclear whether spontaneous firing rate phases align with the phases of calcium rhythms. Imaging with both voltage sensors and calcium sensors in SCN slices, researchers concluded that resting membrane potential rhythms and calcium rhythms were in phase, yet others concluded that resting membrane potential rhythms and calcium rhythms were in phase in the ventral SCN but that in the dorsal SCN, the calcium rhythm phase led the resting membrane potential rhythms by approximately 2 hours. Because the voltage sensor signal measured from the dorsal SCN may derive from the neural processes of ventral SCN neurons, the cellular interpretation of these results is unclear. Another source for the inconsistency might be the culture conditions; in fact, when SCN neurons were recorded in vivo by photometry, the rhythms in fast calcium activity were in phase with slow calcium rhythms."
3240,"In general, comparisons of population rhythms and rhythms in single cells are not easily reconciled. Our recordings that tracked pacemaker neurons from different identified groups in vivo for 24 hours showed that at the single cell level, slow calcium rhythms were unambiguously in phase with rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations; the latter likely reflect rhythms in spontaneous firing rate. To measure the fast calcium fluctuations, we employed a high-frequency light-sheet scanning microscope termed OCPI-2."
3241,"OCPI-2 resolved limitations present in previous microscope designs that created a bottleneck in terms of the rate at which tissue volumes can be repeatedly scanned. Importantly, it does so without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Its use here was instrumental in allowing us to sample the whole-brain volume at frequencies as high as 5 Hz periodically throughout the day."
3242,"As before, we were mindful that the wavelength and amount of total incident light may activate pacemaker neurons and alter molecular clocks. We used cry01 flies to avoid the direct light responses of pacemaker neurons and found that all pacemaker groups displayed slow calcium rhythms, with patterns that were comparable to those we previously reported, except for that of l-LNv. That group displayed an additional calcium peak in the early evening and another just before lights on."
3243,"Because l-LNv innervates the optic lobes and receives large-scale visual inputs, we speculate that the repeated optical scanning might anomalously activate l-LNv in the evening via visual systems. In the later experiments, when we reduced the illumination duration per hour from 31.5 seconds to 2."
3244,"In 4 s, l-LNv did not show the additional evening peaks; this was true even when measured in flies that were wild type for cry. Shorter durations of light exposure allowed all pacemaker groups to display slow calcium rhythms with phases similar to those obtained from the slow-frequency recording sessions. Therefore, the concern to avoid technical artifacts when imaging light-sensitive pacemakers appears especially acute in the case of l-LNv."
3245,"Nevertheless, by carefully tuning the illumination intensity for calcium imaging, we propose that it is possible to monitor normal slow calcium rhythms and fast calcium fluctuations from the same individual pacemaker neurons. The causal relationships between clock gene rhythms, calcium rhythms, and electrical activity rhythms in the SCN remain generally unresolved. Treating SCN slices with Tetrodotoxin diminished SFR rhythms, partially affected RMP rhythms and CCRs, and slowly affected clock gene rhythms over several days."
3246,"Dispersed SCN cells in vitro showed a TTX-resistant CCR, suggesting that CCR is driven by clock gene rhythms. Thus, the variation in CCR sensitivity to TTX treatment might be caused by the degree to which clock gene rhythms in vitro become progressively dysfunctional. In Drosophila, our findings suggested that clock gene rhythms drive two components of the CCR—both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations—via circadian regulation of the ER channel ITPR and membrane voltage-gated calcium channel α1T."
3247,"Both channels might then contribute to SFR and RMP rhythms. Similarly, in SCN pacemakers, pharmacologically blocking another ER channel, RyR, affected both CCR and SFR rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in basal calcium levels are regulated by calcium from the ER and are required for fast electrical activity rhythms. In addition, SCN pacemakers also showed a circadian rhythm in fast calcium activity mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels."
3248,"Pharmacologically blocking these membrane channels affected SFR rhythms and, in some cases, affected CCR. In our studies, manipulating a membrane voltage-gated calcium channel in all or a subset of pacemakers selectively affected rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations, which likely reflected SFR rhythms and thus impaired circadian outputs; however, it did not significantly affect the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels. Manipulating the ER calcium channel IP3R in all pacemakers affected rhythms in both slow and fast calcium rhythms."
3249,"Therefore, in parallel to mammalian SCN neurons, Drosophila circadian pacemakers generate calcium rhythms by regulating both ER and extracellular calcium sources. Since our results suggest little or no role for the RyR channel, the daily rhythmic regulation in fly pacemakers likely acts on a different set of ER and cytoplasmic membrane channels than those in mammalian pacemakers. We also presented RNAi evidence implicating the Itpr and Ca-alpha1T genes in pacemaker cell calcium fluxes."
3250,"However, for each, only a single RNAi proved effective in reducing rhythmic power and increasing the percentage of arrhythmicity. Corroboration for our findings is provided by a prior report, which found that the same RNAi line we used decreases Itpr RNA levels. Likewise, we find corroboration in a prior report by Jeong et al., who described a specific Ca-alpha1T insertion line as a protein null mutation that exhibited a reduced percentage of rhythmicity and power in DD but without a change in circadian period or in the daily per rhythm. They concluded that Ca-alpha1T expression does not affect the central clock mechanism and surmised instead that it likely affects the output of the circadian system, specifically via a requirement for the channel to permit normal physiological activation of pacemaker neurons. That work provides independent genetic confirmation of our RNAi results, and its conclusions align precisely with our own."
3251,"The RNAi knockdown experiments indicate a role for the ER calcium channel SERCA in supporting slow calcium rhythms in Drosophila pacemakers and behavioral rhythms. However, SERCA knockdown also produced high rates of lethality, and among survivors, strong effects on the PER molecular oscillation. We conclude that SERCA, which maintains the ER cytoplasmic calcium gradient, is essential for the normal physiology of the cells, but these additional phenotypes precluded an assessment of its precise role in circadian rhythmicity."
3252,"In contrast to the situation with SERCA, our results support a hypothesis that ITPR is a crucial actuator of the molecular clock. Previous transcriptomic analysis also supports that possibility; in circadian neurons, Itpr displays rhythmic expression, while SERCA does not. Knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons generally caused stronger deficits in both behavioral rhythms and calcium rhythms than in just the PDF-positive neurons."
3253,"One possibility might be that the RNAi expression level is lower when driven by pdf-GAL4 than when driven by tim-GAL4. However, knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons caused stronger deficits in the amplitude of calcium rhythms of non-PDF-positive neurons than in those of PDF-positive neurons."
3254,"Hence, a difference in the vulnerability to IP3R disruption between PDF-negative and PDF-positive neurons might provide an additional or alternative explanation for why the pdf-GAL4-driven knockdown of Itpr affected neither calcium rhythms nor behavior. We also note that there are examples where a single RNAi line produces stronger behavioral effects when coupled with pdf-GAL4 than with tim-GAL4. Such findings suggest that the final result in such experiments will represent a mixture of GAL4 driver line strength and the differential contributions of the UAS:Responder gene product across different positions within an affected neural circuit."
3255,"Finally, the RNAi knockdown of the plasma membrane calcium channel α1T indicated a role for voltage-gated T-type calcium channels in the final rhythmic output of the pacemakers. Consistent with a role in the presumed output pathway, impairing the rhythm of fast calcium activity strongly affected circadian behavior but did not affect the molecular clock or the slow calcium rhythms. T-type channels play a crucial role in other pacemakers, such as the sinoatrial node of the mammalian heart."
3256,"Their conduction in the hyperpolarized state and closure at more depolarized potentials are central to their role in generating bursting dynamics with periods much longer than the membrane time constant. Given the power spectrum of the fluctuations observed, it seems possible that α1T channels play a similar role in the fast fluctuations of Drosophila circadian neurons. Remarkably, the expression of α1T also displays a circadian rhythm, with distinct phases in different groups of pacemaker neurons."
3257,"Collectively, these results suggest that Itpr and α1T channel activity are critical together to produce clock regulation of rhythms in both slow and fast calcium activities of key pacemaker neurons. Materials and Methods Fly Stocks. Flies were reared on standard yeast-supplemented cornmeal/agar food at room temperature."
3258,"After eclosion, male flies were entrained under LD cycles at 25 °C for at least 3 days. The tim > GCaMPS6s; cry01/01 flies were entrained under LD for more than 6 days. The following fly lines were previously described: tim-GAL4, pdf-GAL4, cry-LexA, UAS-GCaMP6s, and LexAop-GCaMP6s."
3259,"UAS-dSTIM and UAS-dOrai were gifts from G. Hasan, National Center for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, India. UAS-Itpr RNAi was a gift from Mark Wu, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD."
3260,"Stable lines UAS-dcr2; tim-GAL4; UAS-GCaMP6s and pdf-GAL4; UAS-dcr2; cry-LexA, LexAop-GCaMP6s were created for RNAi screening of calcium channels. The cry-LexA line was a gift from F. Rouyer, National Center for Scientific Research, Gyf, Paris, France."
3261,"RNAi lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, and the Tokyo Stock Center: two lines for cac: UAS-KK101478-RNAi and UAS-JF02572-RNAi; two lines for α1T: UAS-KK100082-RNAi and UAS-JF02150-RNAi; three lines for α1D: UAS-GD1737-RNAi, UAS-JF01848-RNAi, and UAS-HMS00294-RNAi; two lines for α2δ: UAS-KK101267-RNAi and UAS-JF01825-RNAi; one line for Orai: UAS-HMC03562-RNAi; three lines for dSTIM: UAS-KK102366-RNAi, UAS-GLC01785-RNAi, and UAS-JF02567-RNAi; two lines for SERCA: UAS-KK107371-RNAi and UAS-JF01948-RNAi; and three lines for RyR: UAS-KK101716-RNAi, UAS-HM05130-RNAi, and UAS-JF03381-RNAi. In Vivo Fly Preparations and Calcium Imaging. The fly surgery followed procedures previously described."
3262,"Flies were first anesthetized by CO2 and immobilized by inserting the neck into a narrow cut in an aluminum foil base. A portion of the dorsoanterior cuticle on one side of the head, an antenna, and a small part of one compound eye were then removed. For slow calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom horizontal scanning Objective Coupled Planar Illumination microscope."
3263,"The scanning was done by moving the stage horizontally every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Each scan contained 20 to 40 separate frames with a step size of 5 to 10 μm. For fast calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom high-speed OCPI-2 microscope."
3264,"Each scanning session involved moving the objective using a piezo motor at 1 to 5 Hz for 1 to 2 minutes. The same scans were then repeated on the same specimens every hour for 24 hours. During both slow and fast imaging modes, fresh haemolymph-like solution was continuously perfused."
3265,Locomotor Activity Rhythm. The Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor system was used to monitor the locomotor activity rhythms of individual flies; 4- to 6-day-old male flies were monitored for 6 days under LD cycles and then for 9 days under DD conditions. The circadian rhythmicity and periodicity were measured by χ2 periodograms with a 95% confidence cutoff and SNR analysis.
3266,"Arrhythmicity was defined by a power value less than 10, a width lower than one, and a period less than 18 hours or more than 30 hours. Immunocytochemistry. The flies were entrained for 6 days under LD and dissected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18."
3267,"After dissection in ice-cold, calcium-free saline, fly brains were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 7% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PER [1:5,000; provided by M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA]."
3268,Secondary antisera were Cy3-conjugated. Images were taken on the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. PER protein immunostaining intensity was measured in ImageJ-based Fiji.
3269,"Imaging Data Analysis. Calcium imaging data were acquired by custom software, Imagine, and preprocessed using custom scripts in Julia 0.6 to produce nonrigid registration, alignment, and maximal projection along the z-axis."
3270,The images were then visualized and analyzed in ImageJ-based Fiji by manually selecting ROIs over individual cells or groups of cells and measuring the intensity of ROIs over time. Slow calcium activity was analyzed as described previously. Fast calcium activity in each scanning session was analyzed similarly.
3271,"Between sequential scanning sessions, the ROIs for individual neurons were manually corrected for position drifts. For the calcium signal of each ROI in each session, the mean of calcium intensity was measured. The range of calcium transients was measured by the average maximal calcium intensity at each time point and by the average minimal calcium intensity at each time point."
3272,"The power spectrum was generated by fast Fourier transform. Then, the calcium signal was filtered by a high-pass filter, and the standard deviation of calcium changes was measured. Calcium activity trace analysis and statistics were performed using R 3."
3273,"Network theory has been applied to connectomes at multiple scales to understand brain-wide organization. Such analyses quantify the interconnectivity and robustness of a network and can identify highly connected nodes that may act as hubs. They also serve as a basis for comparison across brain regions, individuals, developmental stages, or species, enabling researchers to identify commonalities and differences in brain organization. Mesoscale connectomes have been constructed for the brains of humans and other mammals from MRI and MEG data, relying on functional activity correlations to infer connectivity at the millimeter scale."
3274,"Rich-club organization has been observed in several mesoscale connectomes: in humans, other mammals, and light-level connectomes in Drosophila. Rich-club organization has been proposed to contribute to the ability of brains to efficiently integrate and disseminate information. Advancements in electron microscopy and dense volumetric reconstruction have enabled researchers to examine increasingly larger brain networks at the microscale."
3275,"These methods do not make assumptions about the relationship between neuron connectivity and functional correlations; nodes and edges can be directly related to neurons and synaptic connections. For example, rich-club neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are part of well-studied motor control circuits. Patterns of neuronal connectivity that recur in different brain areas, known as motifs, have been proposed as ""building blocks"" of networks, and their prevalence in neural networks has been studied to identify organizational principles."
3276,"Motifs such as reciprocal connections, feedforward loops, and 3-unicycles have received considerable attention in neuroscience owing to their implications for local computation and information flow. In this study, we characterize the network properties of the whole-brain, synapse-resolution connectome generated by the Flywire Consortium, the first complete wiring diagram of an adult brain, that of a female Drosophila melanogaster, and we lay the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical studies in this model system. A summary of data products can be found in Table 1."
3277,"Summary of the dataset and definitions. Here we analyze the v630 snapshot of the Drosophila connectome as a directed weighted graph. Synapses were detected automatically, and for each α→β neuron pair, the total number of synapses between two neurons defines the connection weight. Consistent with the flagship connectome paper, we applied a threshold of five synapses per connection unless otherwise noted; however, we also examined the robustness of several results to variation in the synapse threshold."
3278,"This gives us a graph with 127,978 neurons and 2,613,129 connections. The connectome also contains synapse-level neurotransmitter predictions. The classifier discriminates between six neurotransmitters: the fast-acting classical neurotransmitters acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, and the monoamines dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin."
3279,"In Drosophila, acetylcholine is excitatory and GABA is inhibitory. Glutamate can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within the brain of the fly, it has largely been observed to be inhibitory. The distribution of degrees reflects the amount of connectivity between neurons."
3280,"A neuron’s in-degree is defined as the number of presynaptic partners, and the out-degree is defined as the number of postsynaptic partners. The average in/out-degree of an intrinsic neuron in the brain is 20.5, but in-degree and out-degree are not highly correlated."
3281,"The average connection consists of 12.6 synapses, and the connection probability is 0.000161."
3282,"This makes the fly brain a very sparse matrix when compared with the C. elegans nervous system or the partial wiring diagrams of larval zebrafish and mouse, with or without a threshold applied. This sparsity is due in part to the size of the fly brain."
3283,"The connection probability is highest among neurons with nearby arbors. Only 3% of neuron pairs have arbors within 50 μm of each other, but such pairs make up 71% of all connections. However, even in this close regime, the connection probability in the fly is lower than in other wiring diagrams."
3284,"Neurons form one connected component. To assess interconnectivity, we searched for strongly and weakly connected components. Despite its sparsity, the brain forms a highly connected network—93.3% of neurons are contained in a single strongly connected component (SCC), while 98.8% of neurons are contained in a single weakly connected component (WCC). These giant connected components, which contain the majority of neurons, persist when either the strongest or weakest connections are pruned and are robust to threshold choice, indicating that connectivity is robust: many paths connect neuron pairs. Within the giant SCC, the average shortest directed path length between neuron pairs is 4.42 hops, with every neuron reachable within 13 hops. In the giant WCC, the average shortest undirected path length between neuron pairs is 3.91 hops, with every neuron reachable within 11 hops."
3285,"These numbers are comparable to those found in a similar analysis of the hemibrain dataset. The short path lengths show that the fly brain is relatively shallow compared with artificial networks. The similarities in size and path length distribution between the giant SCC and WCC highlight the prevalence of recurrent connections in the brain: in a mostly feedforward network, one would expect a smaller first SCC with longer path lengths."
3286,"To assess whether high interconnectivity is a consequence of a relatively large number of interconnected neurons or a small number of very highly connected neurons, we constructed survival curves, observing whether large connected components persist when neurons are removed. Removing neurons from the directed network, starting with those of the largest total degree, we find that the first SCC persists until a total degree of 50, at which point the network splits into two SCCs of roughly equal size. These two SCCs correspond to the left and right hemispheres and do not split into separate networks until about 60% of neurons are removed."
3287,Removing neurons from the network by smallest total degree does not result in the division of the first SCC. These results highlight the brain’s robust interconnectivity—it is not dependent on a small population of neurons. We observed similar behavior in the undirected network.
3288,"These results remain qualitatively consistent when neurons are removed by in-degree or out-degree alone. Spectral analysis of the brain: To better understand the brain’s topology, we performed a spectral analysis of a random walk in the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution over all neurons in which 3% of neurons were visited 61.2% of the time."
3289,"These top-visited neurons are classified as attractor nodes. These attractors often make connections in the gnathal ganglia, a large midline neuropil that sends and receives information from the periphery and contains many connections to the ventral nerve cord. We also performed a reverse walk within the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution in which 3% of neurons were visited 42%."
3290,"4% of the time. These neurons are repeller nodes and include many with synapses in the antennal lobes and medullae, brain regions that are close to the olfactory and visual periphery, respectively. The fly brain has a large rich club. Many networks exhibit the rich-club property in which well-connected nodes are preferentially connected to other well-connected nodes."
3291,"Comparing the observed network to a degree-preserving random configuration model, there exists a rich-club regime in the fly brain, with a cut-off of total degree = 37. This regime contains 40,218 neurons, approximately 30% of the neurons in the brain. The connection probability within the rich club is 0.000870, which is 5.4 times higher than the overall connection probability. The size of the rich club suggests that the network topology of the fly brain is fairly distributed, consistent with the connected component results."
3292,"A rich-club analysis considering in-degree alone finds a rich-club regime with an in-degree threshold of 10, while no rich club is observed when considering out-degree alone. Note that, as we continue to remove nodes, we enter a regime where the remaining neurons are no longer preferentially connected to each other. We further consider this very-high-degree regime in the Discussion."
3293,"To examine the extent to which long-distance connections contribute to the rich-club property observed in the fly brain, we constructed an extension of the CFG model in which we constrain the random network by enforcing the measured connection probabilities between the 78 neuropils. By fixing the number of connections between and within neuropils, this neuropil connection model implicitly contains mesoscale spatial information. We find that the observed network is not more highly connected than the NPC model, indicating that interneuropil connections contribute to the rich-club effect."
3294,"The fraction of neurons in the rich-club regime in the fly is substantially larger than in C. elegans, which has a rich club of 11 neurons. Note that the differences in rich-club size are sensitive to the criteria used to determine the rich-club cut-off and may also be a consequence of the different scales of these two networks."
3295,"Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that while the worm rich club contains known hub neurons, such as the command neurons AVA and AVB, such highly connected hub neurons do not seem to be present in the fly brain—although there are neurons with very high degrees, there also exist alternative paths between most neuron pairs. Recurrent motifs are over-represented. Connection reciprocity is a measure of the amount of direct feedback in the brain. Across the brain, this connection reciprocity probability is 0.138, higher than in both the Erdős–Rényi and CFG random models. The over-representation of reciprocal connections in brains is well established, and our results are consistent with previous observations in Drosophila and in other species. The clustering coefficient, a metric that assesses the prevalence of triplet structures in the network, is 0.0477 in the fly brain, higher than in both the ER and CFG models. The high clustering coefficient demonstrates that the network is highly connected and is non-random in its structure. We present these metrics alongside those for two existing whole-animal connectomes, the hermaphrodite and male C. elegans, and two subvolume wiring diagrams, the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish and a region of L2/3 mouse visual cortex. Despite differences in the sparsity of the different brain networks, the values of reciprocity and clustering coefficient are comparable across all five datasets. The ER and CFG models do not contain any spatial information, instead assuming that any neuron pair may randomly connect."
3296,"Our NPC model contains mesoscale spatial information but does not make distance comparisons for each neuron pair. We therefore constructed a neuron-neuron distance model with two different spatial zones of connection probability, informed by the distribution of connections as a function of distance. We computed the reciprocity and clustering coefficient for both the NND and NPC models and found that the metrics for the real network were higher than in both spatial null models, suggesting that the nonrandom connectivity observed in the brain is not solely a consequence of spatial or morphological constraints."
3297,"Direct comparisons of networks of different sizes should be interpreted with caution. While the fly and worm datasets are complete brains, the zebrafish and mouse datasets are derived from brain subvolumes with truncated neurons. Moreover, differences in synapse detection and thresholding will impact topological metrics such as connection probability and reciprocity."
3298,Varying the synapse threshold in the fly did not substantially change these metrics. A small-world network is one in which nodes are highly clustered and path lengths are short. High small-worldness coefficients are associated with efficient communication between nodes.
3299,"The small-worldness coefficient of the whole-brain fly connectome is SΔ = 141, higher than that of the C. elegans connectome and close to that of the internet, implying highly effective global communication among neurons in the brain. The average strength of edges participating in reciprocal connections is higher than the average strength of unidirectional connections."
3300,"The majority of unidirectional connections are cholinergic, while the edges participating in reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic neurons and more GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory connections in the brain have more synapses on average compared with excitatory connections, which may partially explain the higher average strength of reciprocal connections. The most common reciprocal pairing is ach-GABA, and the second most common pairing is ach-glutamate."
3301,"Both of these reciprocal motifs are excitatory-inhibitory, and both are overrepresented when compared to the neurotransmitter frequencies observed for reciprocal connections. By contrast, excitatory-excitatory ach-ach pairs are underrepresented, as are inhibitory-inhibitory GABA-GABA pairs. We observed reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory connection strengths to be only weakly correlated, whereas ach-ach pairs were uncorrelated."
3302,"Examples of reciprocal neuron pairs are shown in the figure. Of the 127,978 neurons in the brain, 77,607 participate in at least one reciprocal connection: approximately 2 in every 3 neurons."
3303,"Many neurons participate in multiple reciprocal connections. We define reciprocal degree as the number of reciprocal connections made by a given neuron. Plotting the distributions of reciprocal degree by neurotransmitter, we observe that the majority of neurons with a high reciprocal degree are GABAergic, while, at lower reciprocal degrees, all three primary neurotransmitter types are well represented."
3304,"For most neurons, the fraction of reciprocal connections is low—on average 23% of incoming and 18% of outgoing connections are reciprocal. Plotting the fraction of reciprocal incoming connections against the fraction of reciprocal outgoing connections, we observed only a weak correlation, suggesting that the reciprocal degree is not strongly coupled to either in-degree or out-degree. Similarly, there is no relationship between the total degree and the reciprocal degree."
3305,"However, dividing the neuron population by neurotransmitter, we find that neurons of high total degree are mostly GABAergic and, for many of these neurons, more than half of their total connections are reciprocal. The high clustering coefficient of the brain implies an overrepresentation of triplet structures. We determined the frequency at which each of the 12 directed three-node motifs occurs in the brain."
3306,"Feedforward motifs are underrepresented when compared to both ER and CFG models, while all others, including the highly recurrent motifs, are overrepresented. The strengths of edges participating in three-node motifs are higher than the average edge strength. Complex three-node motifs that contain reciprocal connections tend to be stronger than feedforward motifs."
3307,"Examining the neurotransmitter composition of two of these motifs, feedforward loops and 3-unicycles, we found that edges that participate in feedforward loops were predominantly cholinergic, and that the most common neurotransmitter composition includes three cholinergic neurons, forming a feedforward excitatory configuration. The next most common compositions contain either one or two inhibitory edges. Feedforward loops with one inhibitory edge are probably feedforward inhibition motifs, whereas loops with two inhibitory edges are likely disinhibition motifs."
3308,"By contrast, 3-unicycles contain a higher proportion of inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and the three most common 3-unicycle compositions all contain at least one inhibitory neuron. These cycles may act as indirect feedback inhibition circuits. Notably, observed neurotransmitter composition frequencies are closer to what may be expected by chance for feedforward loops than for 3-unicycles."
3309,"Examples of neurons that form three-node motifs are shown in Figure 3f. A high clustering coefficient and an overrepresentation of highly connected motifs suggest that the local structure of the brain displays a high degree of non-randomness, consistent with previous studies in C. elegans and in the mouse cortex. The overrepresentation of feedforward loops has been widely observed in other biological networks, such as in the rat cortex and C. elegans."
3310,"This overrepresentation is present in most neuropils in the brain. Neurons with few inputs and many outputs may function as broadcasters of signals, while those with many inputs and few outputs may act as integrators. To examine such neurons, we divided the intrinsic rich-club neurons into three categories based on their relative in-degree and out-degree, defining broadcasters as those for which out-degree ≥ 5 × in-degree and integrators as those for which in-degree ≥ 5 × out-degree."
3311,"These definitions, while arbitrary, enable us to describe neuron populations with unbalanced in-/out-degrees. Given these definitions, we find 676 broadcasters and 638 integrators. The remaining intrinsic rich-club neurons, including most highly reciprocal neurons, fall into the balanced category."
3312,"In comparison to the overall population, rich-club neurons are less likely to be cholinergic and more likely to be GABAergic. Integrators are even less likely to be cholinergic and include a large fraction of dopaminergic neurons that may be engaged during learning. By contrast, broadcasters are predominantly cholinergic."
3313,"Central brain neurons are substantially overrepresented in the rich club, while optic lobe intrinsic neurons are underrepresented. Many integrators are either central-brain-intrinsic neurons or visual projection neurons, while few broadcasters are intrinsic to the central brain—many are visual centrifugal neurons or optic lobe intrinsic neurons. Broadcasters include a large number of Mi1 and Tm3 neurons—excitatory cells in the ME known to have key roles in the motion detection circuit."
3314,"Most neurons are restricted to a single hemisphere—11% have inputs in both hemispheres and 11% have outputs in both hemispheres. Rich-club neurons are more likely to have inputs or outputs spanning both hemispheres: 18% and 17%, respectively. This is more common for integrators than for broadcasters."
3315,"Some examples of broadcasters, integrators, and balanced neurons are shown in Fig. 4d. The rich club is close to sensory inputs. To assess the distance of the rich-club neurons from sensory inputs, we used a probabilistic information flow model to determine the relative distance of each neuron from a set of seed neurons."
3316,"The model was run with different sets of seed neurons, each corresponding to a specific set of sensory inputs to the brain. This includes all sensory receptors projecting to the central brain as well as the population of visual projection neurons. Ranking these distances and normalizing returned the percentile rank of each neuron with respect to each modality."
3317,"Neurons with a percentile rank < 50% are closer than average to the given input, while neurons with a percentile rank > 50% are farther. The rich-club neurons have a mean percentile rank of 44% relative to the set of all sensory inputs. Integrators have a mean percentile rank of 43%, while broadcasters have a mean percentile rank of 53%."
3318,"The distribution of broadcasters is bifurcated, with one peak closer to inputs and another peak far from inputs. The second peak consists primarily of broadcasters in the optic lobe, which are far from sensory inputs to the central brain. Examining the ranks with respect to individual sensory modalities, we find that rich-club neurons are again closer than average to each modality."
3319,"Examining the distance of neurons to multiple sensory modalities, we find that broadcasters and integrators, while scattered throughout these distributions, tend to be closer than average to multiple sensory inputs. Integrators and broadcasters that are low in rank relative to multiple modalities may be candidate sites for multisensory integration and information propagation. Network differences across brain regions: The Drosophila connectome has been segmented into 78 neuropils, each with different average connection strengths."
3320,"To understand information flow between neuropils, we used a fractional weighting method accounting for each neuron’s projections to and from every neuropil. We computed, for each neuropil, the relative fraction of internal, external incoming, and external outgoing connection weights. These fractions reflect, respectively, the net number of connections within, being received, and being sent from each neuropil."
3321,"We find differences in these fractions across brain regions: the ellipsoid body and fan-shaped body of the central complex have the highest fraction of internal connections, while in other regions, such as the mushroom body, the majority of connections are external. Some regions, such as the lateral horn, send more connections than they receive, while others, such as the lobula plate, receive more connections than they send. The fraction of internal connection weights is not correlated with neuropil size: while large neuropils such as the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebra have sizable fractions of internal weights, they do not rank the highest."
3322,"Note that internal weights include any neurons with endings outside the brain, such as sensory, ascending, and descending neurons, accounting for the high fraction of internal weights in regions such as the ME, which receive inputs from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and the GNG, which connects with large numbers of ascending and descending neurons. Across the brain, 52% of all connection weights can be classified as internal. Comparing the neurotransmitters of the neurons contributing connection weights, we see that internal connections are more likely than external ones to be inhibitory."
3323,"We also see differences in the neurotransmitter composition across regions. Reciprocal connections in neuropils: To perform motif analyses within each neuropil, we identified neuropil subnetworks that treat all connections within a neuropil as edges. Different neuropils differ in connection strength and density."
3324,"Computing the reciprocity in each neuropil, we found regions with high reciprocity probabilities, including the central complex and the ALs. The relative number of reciprocal connections is high in the MB and ME. Note that, for these motif analyses, the results for small neuropils such as the cantles, bulbs, galls, accessory ME, and ocellar ganglion are less interpretable due to the small number of neurons."
3325,"In most neuropils, as in the whole brain, reciprocal connections are stronger than unidirectional connections. Exceptions include the protocerebral bridge, MB calyces, and bulbs, which have stronger unidirectional than reciprocal connections. There are differences in the relative prevalence of each neurotransmitter in reciprocal and unidirectional connections across neuropils: while in most neuropils, reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic and more GABAergic edges, there are notable exceptions, such as in the neuropils of the central complex."
3326,"In the MB, we find especially large differences in the neurotransmitter composition between unidirectional and reciprocal connections. Comparing the edge strengths of reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connections within neuropil subnetworks, we observe that excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths are more strongly correlated in some neuropils than in others. These correlations do not appear to be dependent on neuropil size."
3327,"Identifying NSRNs: We searched for intrinsic highly reciprocal rich-club neurons that make the majority of their connections within a single neuropil, and found 1,863 neurons that meet these criteria. These neuropil-specific highly reciprocal neurons are predominantly inhibitory: 54% are GABAergic, and another 10% are glutamatergic. In some neuropils, such as the AL and EB, there are many NSRNs, while in other neuropils, there exist only a handful of such neurons."
3328,"Some NSRNs, like the APL neurons in the MB, CT1 neurons in the lobula, or AL local neurons, are known to provide global feedback inhibition in these regions. These neurons tend to be highly branched, with individual processes making reciprocal connections with different feedforward neurons. Some have been shown to have compartmentalized activity, raising the possibility of local computation."
3329,"NSRNs that have yet to be characterized may have similar roles in other circuits—for example, it is likely that NSRNs found in the AVLP provide feedback to the auditory circuits in this region. Interneuropil reciprocal connections: While many reciprocal connections occur within single neuropils, 12.1% of all reciprocal pairs are formed by connections in two neuropils."
3330,"Mapping these reciprocal connections, we find off-diagonal terms that represent pairs connecting across neuropils. The compartments of the MB are linked by many reciprocal connections, while the neuropils of the suboesophageal zone, including the GNG, saddle, and prow, form a connected block. Strong reciprocal connectivity also occurs across the midline, such as between the left and right ALs."
3331,"Neuropils close to the midline, such as the superior medial protocerebrum, superior posterior slope, and inferior posterior slope, tend to have many cross-hemispheric reciprocal connections. There also exist reciprocal connections that span the central brain, such as those between the left and right anterior optic tubercles or the left and right lateral accessory lobes, demonstrating that recurrent motifs are not limited to local connections—they also exist at large spatial scales. Examples of such pairs are shown in Extended Data Fig."
3332,"We also compared the map of reciprocal connections to the projectome map of all connections. For example, the superior lateral protocerebrum and superior intermediate protocerebrum are connected to the FB in the projectome but have no reciprocal connections."
3333,"Similarly, the laminae have many internal connections but few reciprocal ones. Examining Ach–GABA reciprocal connections highlights deviations from symmetry that represent a net imbalance of excitatory–inhibitory reciprocal connections. For example, between the LO and PVLP, most Ach–GABA reciprocal connections share directionality: the Ach connections are in the LO and the GABA connections are in the PVLP."
3334,"Three-node motifs differ across regions: We computed the prevalence of three-node motifs in each neuropil subnetwork relative to ER and CFG null models. Across most neuropils, we observed the same trend as we do across the entire brain: an under-representation of feedforward motifs and an over-representation of complex motifs. However, there are notable differences between neuropils."
3335,"In the cantles, epaulettes, and gorgets, for example, the frequency of three-node motifs was closer to that expected in a CFG null model, while in the FB and EB, complex motifs are particularly over-represented, consistent with their high reciprocity. Feedforward loops are over-represented in most neuropils, except for the FB, EB, NO, and MB compartments. This suggests a relative under-representation of both feedforward excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits in these brain regions."
3336,"3-unicycles, an indirect feedback inhibition circuit, are over-represented across the entire brain but are under-represented in most neuropils. The notable exceptions, the ME and GNG, are very large neuropils with many sensory inputs. The over-representation of 3-unicycles in the ME implies the existence of localized cyclic structures in early visual circuitry."
3337,"Notably, this motif is also over-represented in the zebrafish oculomotor circuit. Motifs 7–10 are under-represented in the ALs, perhaps a result of the small number of unidirectional edges in these regions. In most neuropils, we find that edges participating in underrepresented motifs are weaker on average than edges participating in over-represented motifs, and that edges participating in three-node motifs are stronger than average."
3338,"This is broadly consistent with the whole-brain three-node motif strength results. A notable exception is the laminae, where feedforward connections are strong despite being under-represented. The completion of a wiring diagram of the full brain of D. melanogaster enabled us to characterize its network properties, laying the groundwork for connecting circuit motifs to biological function. Our analysis leverages spatial information, neuron class distinctions, cell type labels, and neurotransmitter predictions to interpret the network features we uncovered. Despite its sparsity, the fly brain is a robust and highly interconnected network, with over-represented reciprocal and recurrent motifs spanning multiple brain regions."
3339,"These long-range connections may explain results from recent brain-wide neural recording experiments in flies and other species that have uncovered widespread activity related to both sensory processing and behavior. We provide searchable and filterable lists of the neurons discussed in this study, as well as a motif search and visualization tool to facilitate hypothesis generation and model development online through Codex. The availability of neurotransmitter predictions for at least ach, GABA, glut, da, ser, and oct greatly enhanced our ability to interpret the circuit motifs we identified in the connectome."
3340,"However, although neurotransmitter predictions are 94% accurate when compared to a set of ground truth neurons, there are cases in which the predicted neurotransmitter does not align with the known transmitter. Here we manually corrected the Kenyon cells to be cholinergic. There may exist other populations that are also systematically misidentified, but which currently lack ground truth neurotransmitter information."
3341,"While we assume that neurons obey Dale’s law, there are several known examples of co-transmission in Drosophila. It remains unclear how widespread neurotransmitter co-transmission is. Note also that the synaptic connectome does not provide a complete picture of information flow in the brain. We do not currently have a map of gap junction synapses in the fly or of the extent of neuropeptide signaling. Some analyses, particularly those dependent on network topology, are sensitive to our choice of synapse threshold. While connectomes in C. elegans have been proofread to the level of individual synapses, this is not feasible in larger datasets. We therefore rely on automated synapse detection algorithms with a non-negligible error rate. Not all synapses are successfully attached to neurons, and this completion rate varies across brain regions."
3342,"Although some of these low-synapse-number connections may be spurious, it is likely that some weak connections persist across individuals, as has been found in C. elegans. Our companion paper on the fly optic lobe has found that a lower synapse threshold is important for correct cell type identification in those brain regions, further suggesting the importance of some low-synapse connections."
3343,"Here, we applied a consistent and conservative threshold of five synapses per connection between neurons, and we demonstrated that our interpretations of connected components, sparsity, reciprocity, and clustering coefficients are not dependent on this threshold. It is likely that the fly brain is more strongly interconnected than the results here indicate. Local circuit motifs are often inferred to be feedforward or feedback connections."
3344,"However, it is difficult to place local circuits in the context of global directionality from sensory input to motor output. In shallow networks, the directionality of the wiring diagram is clear. However, the larger the network becomes, the more difficult it becomes to establish directionality."
3345,"In this study, we used an information flow method to rank neurons relative to various sensory modalities. Ultimately, the directionality of information flow in particular circuits, especially those in regions of the brain far from sensory inputs or motor outputs, must be determined experimentally. Different neuropils in Drosophila are known to have different functions."
3346,"Studying network topology at the brain scale enables us to highlight how these functional differences are supported by network differences. For example, the mushroom bodies (MBs) are known to be a center for learning and memory in the fly brain. We find in the MB compartments the largest fraction of dopaminergic connections, the biggest differences between reciprocal and unidirectional neurotransmitter percentages, and a three-node motif distribution close to that of null models."
3347,"This combination of network characteristics is unique across the neuropils of the brain. Another well-studied neuropil, the ellipsoid body (EB), is known to be involved in navigation, supporting persistent activity correlated to heading direction. We observed that the EB has one of the highest reciprocity rates, one of the highest average connection strengths, and very large over-representations of highly recurrent three-node motifs."
3348,"This represents a unique combination of neuropil-scale network properties. By contrast, while the lateral horn has a similar three-node motif profile, it has much lower characteristics. The rich club and anatomical bottlenecks suggest two potential bottlenecks: one between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere and one between the central brain and optic lobes. Only 12% of neurons cross hemispheres and 6% of neurons cross between the central brain and optic lobes."
3349,"Despite these bottlenecks, the brain is still robustly interconnected with short path lengths. The large rich-club regime in the fly brain may explain these short path lengths. When compared to the average neuron in the brain, rich-club neurons are more likely to contain synapses in both hemispheres and are also more likely to connect the optic lobes to the central brain."
3350,"The broad spatial reach of these rich-club neurons also keeps path lengths short across these bottlenecks. It has been proposed that rich-club hubs in functional connectomes help keep path lengths short. In the fly brain, we see that the rich-club neuron population indeed contributes to short path lengths."
3351,"Future functional experiments in the fly focusing on the rich-club population may shed light on whether this is the case at the neuron scale. We also expect that the ascending and descending neurons, which form a bottleneck between the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC), will be part of the central nervous system rich club. Many ascending and descending neurons appear to have high degrees when examined within either the brain or the VNC."
3352,"We await the completion of a complete CNS connectome to verify the rich-club membership of such neurons. Our rich-club analysis showed that we enter a rich-club regime above a total degree of 37. However, as we continue to remove neurons, we find that the population of neurons above degree ~100 are no longer preferentially connected relative to either CFG or NPC random networks."
3353,"On the basis of the SCC and WCC survival curves, these very-high-degree neurons do not form multiple islands of connectivity. Rather, the first connected component persists until nearly all neurons are removed, and the second connected component never approaches the size of the first. The under-representation of connections between the very highest degree neurons is correlated with neurotransmitter composition—most are GABAergic."
3354,"These very large GABAergic neurons are less likely than chance to form connections with each other. Comparing network properties across different species has the potential to uncover conserved and divergent properties of brain organization. Similarities in reciprocity and clustering coefficient across animals, which vary substantially in both size and connection density, hint at the possibility that some features of circuit architecture may be broadly conserved across nervous systems."
3355,"However, comparisons of graph metrics across networks of different sizes, even for neuron-normalized metrics such as reciprocity and clustering coefficient, must be made with care. Moreover, as mentioned previously, differences in proofreading and thresholding will impact topological metrics, which treat all edges as equivalent. Applying the same threshold across datasets does not resolve this, as a given number of synapses may have different biological implications across species."
3356,"It has also been observed, both in this work and in past studies, that different parts of the brain of the fly differ in their connectivity properties. It is likely that the same is true in larger brains, meaning that statistics derived from partial wiring diagrams may not be representative. In C. elegans, there is substantial variability in the connectomes of genetically identical individuals. Comparisons between the FlyWire and hemibrain datasets have already revealed similarities and differences between individual flies, but more datasets will be needed before we fully understand the variability between individuals in Drosophila. Fortunately, more whole-brain connectomes are on the horizon."
3357,"The network analysis of the fly brain presented should serve as a valuable baseline for comparison, both to the connectomes of other Drosophila individuals and to the connectomes of other species, to identify which network features are common and which are species- or individual-specific. A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ""parts list"" of the brain and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision."
3358,"Here we analyze the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families at least double in number of types."
3359,A new serpentine medulla interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analyzing the distances in high-dimensional feature space and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features.
3360,"We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object, and color vision. Connectivity with ""boundary types"" that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity, and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development."
3361,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the twentieth century concern the neural basis of sensory perception. Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery of simple and complex cells in the visual cortex not only entered neuroscience textbooks, but the hypothetical neuronal wiring diagrams in their 1962 paper also inspired convolutional nets, which eventually ignited the deep-learning revolution in artificial intelligence. It may come as a surprise that directly mapping such wiring diagrams, influential as they may be, has been highly challenging or even impossible in mammalian brains."
3362,"Progress is being made by visual physiologists, and the reconstruction of a column of visual cortex from electron microscopy images is also becoming feasible. These are tiny slivers of visual systems; scaling up to the full complexity of mammalian vision is still aspirational. To imagine the future of visual neuroscience, it is helpful to extrapolate from a brain of a more modest size—that of the fly."
3363,"Especially over the past 15 years, visual neural circuits have been intensively investigated in Drosophila with great progress in understanding the perception of motion, color, and objects, as well as the role of vision in complex behaviors like courtship. The release of a neuronal wiring diagram of a Drosophila brain poses an unprecedented opportunity. The first wiring diagram for a whole brain contains as a corollary the first wiring diagram for an entire visual system, as well as all the wiring connecting the visual system with the rest of the brain."
3364,"About 38,500 neurons are intrinsic to the right optic lobe of the reconstructed Drosophila brain. The full wiring diagram for these neurons is too complex to comprehend or even visualize. It is essential to reduce complexity by describing the connectivity between types of cells."
3365,"For example, the roughly 800 ommatidia in the compound eye send photoreceptor axons to roughly 800 L1 cells in the lamina, which in turn connect with around 800 Mi1 cells. That is a lot of cells and connections, but they can all be described by the simple rules that photoreceptors connect to L1, and L1 connects to Mi1. Some such rules are known, but this knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete."
3366,"Here we exhaustively enumerate all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe and find all rules of connection between them. We effectively collapse 38,500 intrinsic neurons onto just 227 types, a reduction of more than 150×. The wiring diagram is reduced from a 38,500 × 38,500 matrix to a 227 × 227 matrix, an even greater compression."
3367,"We additionally provide rules of connectivity between intrinsic types and 500 types of boundary neurons, which have also been annotated. In our connectomic approach, a cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar patterns of connectivity, and such cells are expected to share the same function. By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions."
3368,"This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking. Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe and are the main topic of this study. Moreover, there are boundary neurons that straddle the optic lobe and the rest of the brain."
3369,"Boundary neurons fall into several classes: visual projection neurons project from the optic lobe to the central brain, visual centrifugal neurons do the opposite, and heterolateral neurons extend from one optic lobe to the other while making few or no synapses in the central brain. Targets of boundary neurons in the central brain are generally multimodal and/or sensorimotor, mixing information coming from the eyes and other sense organs, so we regard the optic lobe proper as the fly’s visual system. The brain of a single Drosophila adult female was reconstructed by the FlyWire Consortium."
3370,"We proofread around 38,500 intrinsic neurons in the right optic lobe, as well as 3,900 VPNs, 250 VCNs, 150 heterolateral neurons, and 4,700 photoreceptor cells. In total, 77% of the synapses of intrinsic neurons are with other intrinsic neurons, and 23% are with boundary neurons. We divide optic lobe intrinsic neurons into four broad classes: columnar, local interneuron, cross-neuropil tangential, and cross-neuropil amacrine."
3371,"Cells of the columnar class have axons oriented parallel to the main axis of the visual columns. Following a previous study, the arbor of a columnar neuron is allowed to be wider than a single column; what matters is the orientation of the axon, not the aspect ratio of the arbor. Photoreceptor cells are columnar but are not intrinsic to the optic lobe, strictly speaking, because they enter from the retina."
3372,"Nevertheless, they will sometimes be included with intrinsic types in the following analyses. The optic lobe contains four main neuropils and a smaller fifth neuropil—the accessory medulla. We further distinguish between distal and proximal medulla, regarding them as two separate neuropils."
3373,"The border between them is layer 7 of the medulla, which is also known as the serpentine layer. A columnar cell spans multiple neuropils. Cells of the local interneuron class are defined as being confined to a single neuropil."
3374,We also define two classes that cross multiple neuropils but are not columnar. A cross-neuropil tangential cell has an axon that is oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the visual columns as it runs inside a neuropil. A cross-neuropil amacrine cell lacks an axon.
3375,Interneurons are typically amacrine but sometimes have an axon in the tangential orientation. Each class is divided into families. A family is defined as a set of cells that share the same neuropils.
3376,"For example, the Tm family projects from the distal medulla to the lobula, while the TmY family projects from the distal medulla to both the lobula and lobula plate. Each family is divided into cell types. All 227 intrinsic types as well as photoreceptor types are available for 3D interactive viewing at the Fly-Wire Codex."
3377,"Supplementary Data 1 includes a list of all intrinsic types and their properties. Supplementary Data 2 contains one ""card"" for each type, which includes its discriminative logical predicate, basic statistics, a diagram showing stratification and other single-cell anatomy, and 3D renderings of all the cells in the type. Most neurons in the optic lobe are columnar, and half of the families are columnar."
3378,"Interneurons constitute just 17% of optic lobe intrinsic neurons, but the majority of cell types. A columnar family contains more cells than any other family. An interneuron family contains more types than any other family."
3379,"The columnar families are well known. The Sm interneuron family is new, and its name is inspired by its stratification in the serpentine medulla. Some of the cross-neuropil families are wholly or almost wholly new."
3380,"Over half of the cell types are new, and many of these are interneuron types. For each cell, we define an output feature vector by the number of output synapses onto neurons of cell type t, which runs from 1 to T. The output feature vector is a row of the cell-to-type connectivity matrix."
3381,"For each cell, we similarly define an input feature vector by the number of input synapses received from neurons of cell type t. This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix. The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector."
3382,"The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227. A cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar feature vectors. Cells of the same type are near each other in feature space, while cells of different types are far away."
3383,This was quantified using the weighted Jaccard distance. Our definition of feature vectors requires that some cell types should already exist. An initial set of cell types was defined by human analysts using traditional morphological criteria.
3384,"These traditional cell types were used to compute feature vectors, and hierarchical clustering was applied. In many cases, this led to further division into cell types that could not be distinguished by traditional criteria. In other cases, it led to the grouping of morphological variants into a single type."
3385,"After splitting or merging types, the feature vectors were recomputed, and the process continued iteratively. The final cell types were validated in several ways. We show that our clustering is self-consistent, in the sense that almost all cells end up in the original cluster if we attempt to reassign each cell’s feature vector to the nearest cluster."
3386,"For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership. We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of, on average, five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil."
3387,"Hierarchical clustering of cell types: We defined a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity. It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim, “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections.” The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions."
3388,"A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization. Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
3389,"By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions. This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking."
3390,"Class, family, and type: Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe and are the main topic of this study.

3400,A columnar family contains more cells than any other family. An interneuron family contains more types than any other family. The columnar families are well known.

3403,"This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix. The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector. The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227."

A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization."
3410,"Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
3411,"One approach that we have found to be helpful is to display the top input and output connections of each type. In such a graph, some nodes can have more than one outgoing and/or more than one incoming connection. A few of these nodes appear as ""hubs"" with many visible connections."
3412,"For example, Mi1 is the top input to a large number of postsynaptic types. The nodes of the graph were positioned in 2D space by a graph layout algorithm that tends to place strongly connected types close together. It turns out that nearby nodes in the 2D graph layout space tend to belong to the clusters that were extracted from the high-dimensional connectivity-based feature vectors."
3413,"We can also normalize the type-to-type connection matrix to represent the fraction of synapses from cell type s to cell type t. Depending on the normalization, this could be the fraction of input to type t or the fraction of output from type s. Input and output fractions are shown in Supplementary Data 5 and are equivalent to the cell type feature vectors defined earlier."
3414,"The heat maps of Supplementary Data 5 are important because they show a much more complete set of connections than the wiring diagrams, which are highly selective visualizations. The degree of a cell type can be defined as the number of cell types to which it is connected. Weak connections can be excluded from this definition by thresholding the type-to-type connection matrix before computing degree."
3415,"For a threshold-independent measure, we instead calculate a ""perplexity"" for each cell type. The outgoing connection strengths are normalized as if they were a probability distribution, and out-perplexity is defined as the exponential of the entropy of this distribution. Out-perplexity reduces to out-degree in the special case that the distribution is uniform over the connected partners."
3416,"In-perplexity is defined analogously. If intrinsic cell types are ranked by the product of out- and in-perplexity, then TmY5a is the most connected hub, while various types in the lamina and distal medulla are the least hub-like. Motion-related cell types generally do not exhibit high perplexity."
3417,"Out-perplexity tends to be greater than in-perplexity, although they are positively correlated. One might expect that ""early"" types in visual processing would have divergent connectivity to distribute photoreceptor signals to many targets, while ""late"" types would have convergent connectivity, summarizing the final results of optic lobe computations for use by the central brain. This idea can be tested by ranking types according to the ratio of out-perplexity to in-perplexity."
3418,"Indeed, the top of the list includes early types like the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, L3 and L5, and many Dm and Pm interneuron types, while many Sm types are near the bottom of the list; they can be interpreted as ""late"" types given their extensive connectivity with VPNs. The numerous cell types include photoreceptor axons that project retinotopically from the eye to the lamina and distal medulla. The medulla is divided into columns, which are presumed to correspond one-to-one with ommatidia of the compound eye."
3419,"Cell types containing more than 720 cells in our reconstruction, as well as photoreceptor types, will be called ""numerous"". The top end of this range is likely to represent the true number of columns in this optic lobe. For each numerous type, the cells appear to be distributed one per column, and the true number of cells is expected to approximate 800."
3420,"The observed cell numbers are mostly smaller than 800; some cells are missing from columns, presumably due to under-recovery by proofreading. The connections between numerous types agree well with a previous reconstruction of seven medulla columns. The 28 numerous types have long been known."
3421,"At the other extreme, 16 types contain only a single cell. Most types lie between the extremes. It is the less numerous types of which our knowledge has been incomplete, and arguably they are where much of the magic of vision happens."
3422,"As with the photoreceptors, neural activity in the numerous cell types like L1 and Mi1 mostly encodes information about the image at or near single points in visual space. But perception requires the integration of information from points that can be quite distant from each other, and this is done by the larger neurons that belong to the less numerous types. For most of the numerous types, visual responses have been observed previously and will be used to interpret the dendrogram of Fig. 2c. We will see that the numerous types that belong to a single cluster have similar functions, which enables us to ascribe a function to each cluster as a whole. In other words, we extrapolate from the functions of the numerous types to yield preliminary clues regarding the functions of the less numerous types."
3423,"These extrapolations are speculative and are merely starting points for hypothesis generation and experimental research, and the clusters are not set in stone. They were obtained by thresholding a hierarchical clustering, and adjusting this threshold will change the number of clusters. Rather than use our clusterings, some readers may prefer to directly consult the weighted Jaccard distances between types, from which the clusterings were derived."
3424,"Other cautionary notes about the clusters are given in the Methods and Discussion. These caveats notwithstanding, we next proceed to functional interpretation of the clusters in Fig. 2c."
3425,"ON, OFF, and luminance channels: Cluster 10 and cluster 11 both receive strong input from photoreceptors R1–6, and we propose that they are regarded as OFF and ON channels, respectively, carrying information about light decrements and light increments. Our concept is similar to the well-known ON and OFF motion pathways but differs because our ON and OFF channels are general purpose, feeding into the object and color subsystems as well as the motion subsystem. Cluster 10 contains the OFF cells L2, L4, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4."
3426,"Cluster 11 contains the ON cells L5, Mi1, and Tm3, and also the OFF cell L1. It makes sense to assign L1 to the ON channel even though it is an OFF cell because L1 is inhibitory/glutamatergic, so its effects on downstream partners are similar to those of an ON excitatory cell. Note that information about whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory was not used by our clustering algorithm."
3427,"Cluster 11 also contains C2 and C3, which are expected to be ON cells because their top inputs are L1 and L5. A companion paper argues that the various Dm interneuron types in cluster 10 and cluster 11 normalize the activities of numerous types in the OFF and ON channels. The ON and OFF motion pathways were traditionally defined by working backwards from the T4 and T5 motion detectors, which respectively compute the directions of moving ON and OFF stimuli."
3428,"The ON motion pathway is directly upstream from T4 and includes Mi1, Mi4, Mi9, and Tm3. The OFF motion pathway is directly upstream from T5 and includes Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9. Figure 4 shows that these cell types have other strong targets besides T4/T5, so they do not seem to be solely or chiefly dedicated to motion."
3429,"L3 connectivity is sufficiently unique that it stands apart from all of the other cell types as a cluster containing only the single type L3. This is consistent with current thinking that L3 constitutes a separate luminance channel, distinct from ON and OFF channels. L3 is the only L type with a sustained rather than transient response, and it encodes luminance rather than contrast."
3430,"Cluster 7 includes Dm4, Dm9, Dm12, Dm20, and Mi9, which all have L3 as their strongest input. Mi9 is also the strongest output of L3 and, like L3, exhibits a sustained response. We therefore propose that cluster 7 should be combined with L3 in a hypothetical luminance channel."
3431,"Mi9 is traditionally grouped in the ON motion pathway, but Mi9 is an input to the object and color subsystems, not only the motion subsystem. It is less obvious whether the remaining types in cluster 7 should be grouped in the luminance channel. Indeed, these types separate into distinct clusters when the threshold is adjusted to refine the flat clustering."
3432,"These types might alternatively be assigned to the color subsystem, as Mi15 and Dm2 are known to receive direct input from inner photoreceptor R8. Lawf2 is a distinct cluster. By targeting cell types in cluster 11, Lawf2 provides centrifugal feedback to the ON channel."
3433,"However, the strongest output of Lawf2 is Lai, which is thought to mediate lateral inhibition in the lamina through pathways such as R1–6→Lai→R1–6 and R1–6→Lai→L3. Lawf2 may therefore modulate lateral interactions mediated by Lai. The strongest input to Lawf2 is OA-AL2b2, which could be octopaminergic or cholinergic."
3434,"If it is octopaminergic, this input could be the source of the previously reported octopaminergic gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons. Lawf2 also receives strong input from cluster 9, which is hypothesized to become an object subsystem later on. Lai and Lawf1, the two types in cluster 8, have similar targets."
3435,"Cluster 8 provides centrifugal feedback to the OFF channel and to R1–6. Alternatively, cluster 8 could be interpreted as part of the luminance channel, as cluster 7 is a strong input and L3 is a strong output. The motion-detecting T4 and T5 families belong to cluster 15."
3436,"Cluster 16 contains CT1 and Tm9, which are well known to be important for motion computation. It makes sense to regard Tm9 as dedicated to the motion subsystem rather than part of a general-purpose OFF channel, as 80% of its output synapses are onto CT1 or T5. Cluster 16 also includes Li14, an interneuron type with T5a as the strongest input, and T5a through T5d as the strongest outputs."
3437,"T4/T5 neurons synapse onto VPNs that exit the optic lobe and enter the central brain. Cluster 13 and cluster 14 contain the lobula plate interneuron family, LPi1 through LPi15. Over half of these are new."
3438,"Some LPi types consist of one or two cells that cover the entire visual field. Two LPi types may stratify in the same lobula plate layers but consist of cells with different sizes. Most LPi types are amacrine, but some exhibit axo-dendritic polarization."
3439,"Some types collectively cover only a portion of the visual field. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 types, so it is clear that cluster 13 and cluster 14 are related to motion vision. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 cells with a single preferred direction."
3440,"The only exception is LPi07, which receives inputs from T4/T5 cells with preferred directions c and d. LPi types synapse onto other LPi types and onto VPNs. Cluster 13 also contains columnar neurons from three Y types and all Tlp types."
3441,"All of these are predicted to be glutamatergic and are reciprocally connected with T4/T5 of particular preferred directions. The only exception is Tlp5, which receives input only from T4a/T5a. The Y and Tlp types also connect with LPi and columnar VPN types."
3442,"TmY20 and Am1 also belong to cluster 13 and were previously identified to be motion related. Cluster 9 includes the numerous types T2 and T3, which have been implicated in the detection of small objects. Their downstream VPN partners LC1147 and LC1848 are also activated by small objects."
3443,"On the basis of this information, we propose that cluster 9 is part of a hypothetical object subsystem. Cluster 9 includes many other types from columnar families, interneuron families, and cross-neuropil tangential and amacrine families. Downstream targets include LC, LPLC, and LT types."
3444,"Mi1 and Tm1 are the most prominent inputs to the subsystem and respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels defined above. They are top inputs to T3, explaining why T3 is ON–OFF. T2 is ON–OFF because its top inputs are L5 and Tm2, which respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels."
3445,"Note that the Tm1 input to T2 and the L5 input to T2 are second from the top and therefore do not show up in Fig. 6, which is restricted to the top inputs and outputs. Several types are nearby T2 and T3 in the cell types dendrogram."
3446,"In particular, T2a, Tm21, Tm25, Tm27, TmY3, and Y3 are fairly numerous and excitatory, so we regard them as candidate object detectors. Despite its name, T2a is more similar to T3 in connectivity than to T2. T2a also receives Mi1 and Tm1 input like T3 and is predicted to be ON–OFF."
3447,"The top output of T2a is LC17, which is known to be activated by small objects and also receives input from T3. Cluster 12 contains Li19 and Li25. Cluster 9 is both a strong input to cluster 12 and a strong output of cluster 12, largely due to connections between Tm21 and Cluster 12."
3448,"We therefore include cluster 12 as well as cluster 9 in the object subsystem. The inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 are important for Drosophila colour vision because their responses are more narrowly tuned to the wavelength of light than those of the outer photoreceptors R1–6. R7 prefers ultraviolet light, whereas R8 prefers blue or green light."
3449,"Cluster 4 contains Dm8a, Dm8b, Dm11, and DmDRA2, which are all inner photoreceptor targets. Cluster 1 contains most of the remaining types so far implicated in colour vision. As originally defined by morphology, Tm5 is a potential postsynaptic target of the inner photoreceptors because it stratifies in the distal medulla at the M7 border and also in the M3."
3450,These are the medulla layers containing the axon terminals of R7 and R8. We found that Tm5 consists of six cell types. Three of our connectomic Tm5 types correspond to canonical Tm5 types that were previously defined by morphology and Ort expression.
3451,"Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 input, while Tm5c receives R8 input. Moreover, we found three new types, Tm5d, Tm5e, and Tm5f, that receive little or no photoreceptor input, although their stratifications are similar to those of the canonical Tm5 types. The correspondences between connectomic and morphological-molecular Tm5 types were established using morphological criteria."
3452,"However, the reader should be cautioned that there is considerable variability within a type, so reliably typing individual cells based on morphology alone is difficult or impossible. Connectivity is essential for reliable discrimination. Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 and Dm8 input, as expected from previous reports."
3453,"Tm5c receives R8 input and also strong L3 input. While some synapses from Dm8 to Tm5c do exist, this connection seems to be weak. Tm20 has been implicated in color vision because it receives R8 input. It also receives strong L3 input. Thus, Tm20 inputs are similar to Tm5c inputs, consistent with the physiological finding that these two types are more similar to each other in their chromatic responses than they are to Tm5a and Tm5b. As Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c, and Tm20 are known to be related to color vision, we propose that the rest of cluster 1 is also part of a hypothetical color subsystem."
3454,"The new Tm5 types receive few or no synapses directly from photoreceptors, but Tm5d receives indirect R7 input from Tm5b and Dm8a, Tm5e receives indirect R8 input from Tm5c, and Tm5f receives indirect R8 input from Tm20. Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic. We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective."
3455,"As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative. Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a and Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37."
3456,"The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla. Nevertheless, we decided to include them in the Tm family."
3457,"Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted not to be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic. Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic."
3458,"Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm, and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10. Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs."
3459,"Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem. This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem."
3460,"Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. Tm20, Tm5d, and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic."
3461,"We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective. As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative."
3462,"Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a, Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37. The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla."
3463,"Nevertheless, we decided to lump them into the Tm family. Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted not to be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic."
3464,"Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic. Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm, and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10."
3465,"Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs. Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem."
3466,"This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem. Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4 in Tlp4."
3467,"In the first stage of morphology-based classification, these errant cells were assigned to Y11. But such pseudo-Y11 cells were later reassigned to Tlp4 on the basis of connectivity. Their feature vectors match Tlp4 because their medullary projections make few synapses, and their connectivity in the lobula and lobula plate matches Tlp4."
3468,"It is worth mentioning an unusual example in which ignoring morphological variation is correct in one sense, but ultimately turns out to be misleading. Three Li11 cells are annotated in the hemibrain reconstruction, and three corresponding cells can be identified in our optic lobe. We group two of these cells as one type."
3469,"The third cell can be paired with a fourth to form a pseudo-Li11 type with a small axonal projection into the central brain. Although the axon is visually striking, it has few synapses and therefore little impact on connectivity. Thus, it might be tempting to ignore the axon as a developmental ""accident"" and merge Li11 and pseudo-Li11 into a single type."
3470,"But it turns out that Li11 and pseudo-Li11 are distinct types, owing to their different connectivity in the lobula. For example, Li25 has strong LT61 output, while pseudo-Li11 has strong LT11 input. Pseudo-Li11 also exists in the hemibrain, although there it lacks the small projection."
3471,"The central brain projection of pseudo-Li11 exhibits variability across individuals, further evidence that it is a developmental accident. We introduce the new names Li25 and Li19 to replace Li11 and pseudo-Li11. A few cells were dismissed as developmental accidents. This could be done with high confidence when the cells were small and few in number."
3472,"However, we had difficulty deciding about Li29 because it was a full-field cell in the lobula, but it also extended a smaller secondary arbor into the lobula plate. Originally, we decided that this cell was a developmental accident and did not include it in our list of types. Later on, we found that this odd-looking cell is repeated in the left optic lobe and promoted it to a type."
3473,"Spatial coverage: all cell typing efforts must decide whether to split types more finely or merge types more coarsely. We resolved this lumper-splitter dilemma by using spatial coverage as a criterion. As a general rule, the cells of a cell type collectively cover all columns of the optic lobe with a density that is fairly uniform across the visual field."
3474,"This makes sense for implementing translation-invariant computations, a strategy that is commonly used in convolutional networks and other computer vision algorithms. Uniform spatial coverage is sometimes called ""tiling,"" although cell type arbors often overlap so much that the analogy to floor tiles is misleading. Spatial coverage is also a property of many cell types in the mammalian retina."
3475,"In some types consisting of just one or a few cells, we identified an unconventional jigsaw-style spatial coverage. For example, LPi14, also known as LPi1-210, is a pair of full-field cells. We refer to them as a jigsaw pair because they jointly cover the visual field in an irregular manner, as if they were cut by a jigsaw."
3476,"Jigsaw types can also be found in other interneuron families and include Pm14, Li27, and Li28. Our feature vector includes no explicit information about the spatial coordinates of a cell. Thus, if clustering feature vectors results in cell types with good spatial coverage, that is an independent validation of the clustering."
3477,"Coverage also solves the lumper-splitter dilemma. Suppose that we attempt to split one type into two candidate types based on hierarchical clustering. If both candidate types exhibit good coverage, then we accept them as valid."
3478,"If the cells of both candidate types seem randomly scattered, that means our split is invalid because it is presumably discriminating between cells based on noise. Chromatic types like Tm5 and Dm8 might seem to be an exception to this rule, but their apparently random locations may turn out to depend systematically on pale and yellow columns. The above are easy cases, but there are also edge cases."
3479,"Suppose that splitting results in two candidate types that neatly cover the dorsal field and the ventral field, respectively, without overlap. We then reject the split, preferring to lump the two candidate types into a single type that exhibits dorsoventral spatial variation in connectivity. On the other hand, if one candidate type covers the dorsal field and the other covers the full field, this is an acceptable split."
3480,"With these heuristics, some of our cell types end up with only partial coverage of the visual field. This is especially common for boundary types. Sm is the intrinsic type family containing the most types with partial coverage."
3481,"This makes sense, given that Sm cells interact closely with many boundary types arborizing in the serpentine layer. Cell types with partial coverage make sense in the later stages of vision. After the early stages of vision, computer vision also often discards translation invariance and may perform different visual computations in different regions of the visual field."
3482,"Discussion: The connectomic approach to cell typing has three advantages. First, it is not subject to the incomplete and biased sampling that can affect other methods. Second, connectivity provides a rich set of features for distinguishing between cell types."
3483,"Third, connectomic cell typing not only yields cell types, but also, importantly, tells us how they are wired to each other. Implications for visual function: We clustered cell types with similar connectivity patterns and proposed tentative interpretations of the clusters in terms of visual functions. These interpretations are speculations but should be useful for generating hypotheses that suggest interesting experiments."
3484,"Our hypothetical subsystems are devoted to motion, object, and color vision and are fed by ON, OFF, and luminance channels. The motion subsystem contains not only the T4 and T5 families but also many interneuron types. Most interneuron types belong to the LPi family, which has been proposed to mediate opponent interactions between cells that are activated by different directions of motion."
3485,"Such opponency was demonstrated between LPi09 and LPi11, also known as LPi3-4 and LPi4-357. It is likely that LPi types can also mediate spatial normalization, as described in a companion paper. Of the 51 types in the hypothetical object subsystem, T2 and T3 have been characterized by physiologists as object detectors."
3486,"Above, we hypothesized that a number of other types are object detectors, and these candidates can be tested by future experiments. The hypothetical color subsystem contains 91 types. One can only speculate about the reason for this numeric preponderance."
3487,"Some insects are known to have sophisticated color vision capabilities such as color constancy. The computations required for color constancy are quite complex, requiring the integration of image information over long ranges. This could potentially be implemented by the large number of Sm and Li interneuron types in the hypothetical color subsystem, assuming that Drosophila exhibits color constancy."
3488,"Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 1 and cluster 3 have additional functions other than color vision and should be subdivided more finely. Future experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. A companion paper predicts that the six types in cluster 2 should exhibit orientation selectivity and hypothesizes that cluster 2 is a subsystem for form vision."
3489,"Cluster 2 connects to cluster 1, suggesting an interaction between form and color computations. Although we have divided the optic lobe into distinct subsystems, we are aware that it is simplistic to assign every cell type to just one functional subsystem. This is the result of the “hard” clustering algorithm that we have used, which always assigns a cell type to a single cluster."
3490,"In reality, a cell type could have more than one function, or a cell type might mediate interactions between more than one subsystem. The wiring diagrams show many connections between cell types in different subsystems. Assigning such a cell type to a single subsystem is inherently ambiguous."
3491,"Implications for visual development The detailed wiring diagram for an adult visual system precisely specifies the end goal of visual system development. Single-cell transcriptomics is providing detailed information about the molecules in fly visual neurons. Comparison of transcriptomic and connectomic information is already uncovering molecules that are important for the development of the fly visual system, and this trend is bound to increase in momentum."
3492,"Such research could be aided by our low-dimensional discriminators of cell types. Early studies relied on Golgi staining to sample neurons from multiple individuals, a technique that is best suited for identifying the most numerous types. Most of our new types are not as numerous, which may be why they were missed."
3493,"Furthermore, Golgi studies may have mistaken morphological variants for types, which could explain why many of their types cannot be identified in our optic lobe. Contemporary light microscopy anatomy leverages genetic lines but still does not evade the limitations of incomplete and biased sampling. The story of Tm5 serves as a case in point."
3494,"A breakthrough in color vision started by genetically labeling neurons that express the histamine receptor Ort. Researchers reasoned that Ort would be expressed by cells postsynaptic to the chromatic photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are histaminergic. Then, light microscopy anatomy was used to make fine distinctions between three Tm5 types labeled in the transgenic line."
3495,"The present connectomic work has revealed six Tm5 types, a finding that was only foreshadowed by previous work on the same EM dataset. The three new Tm5 types were presumably missed by previous studies because they receive little or no direct photoreceptor input and do not express Ort. Nevertheless, they are similar to the old Tm5 types in morphology and connectivity and have been grouped in the hypothetical color subsystem."
3496,"The Tm5 example demonstrates that connectomics can find fresh patches in well-trodden ground. More telling is that connectomics can guide us to entirely new landscapes, such as the 43 Sm types in an entirely new type family. Distinguishing cell types using connectivity features based on connectivity enabled us to discriminate between cell types that stratify in very similar neuropil layers."
3497,"Stratification constrains connectivity because neurons cannot connect with each other unless they overlap in the same layers. However, stratification does not completely determine connectivity because neurons in the same layer may or may not connect with each other. Classical neuroanatomy, whether based on Golgi or genetic staining, relied on stratification because it could be seen with a light microscope."
3498,"Now that we have electron microscopy data, we can rely on connectivity for cell typing rather than settle for stratification as a proxy. That being said, the present study used only connectivity at the final stage of cell typing, which was seeded by the morphological types identified during the first and second stages. It was possible to demonstrate self-consistency of the final cell types using connectivity-based features only."
3499,"We expect that it should be possible to eliminate all dependence on morphological typing and base the approach on connectivity from start to finish. This challenge is left for future work. Spatial organization of connectivity According to our wiring diagrams, whether two neurons are connected depends on their cell types."
3500,"Connectivity also depends on the locations of the neurons in the retinotopic maps of the optic lobe. As a trivial example, it is impossible for cells with small arbors to be connected if they are at distant locations. Less trivial dependencies of connectivity on location also exist."
3501,"We expect them to be important for understanding vision, although they turned out to be unnecessary for classifying cell types. To facilitate spatial analyses of connectivity, the FlyWire Codex maps a number of cell types to locations in the hexagonal lattice of columns and ommatidia. In such analyses, it may be helpful to regard cell types and spatial locations as discrete and continuous latent variables."
3502,A companion paper demonstrates how to predict visual function by characterizing how connectivity depends on both cell type and spatial location. The cell types of cluster 2 are predicted to exhibit orientation selectivity and related phenomena reminiscent of the primary visual cortex.
3503,"This paper began by recounting the story of how wiring diagrams for the visual cortex drawn in the 1960s inspired convolutional nets, which eventually sparked the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. Convolutional nets have now been applied to reconstruct the fly brain from electron microscopy images, making the current study possible. Coming full circle, the fly optic lobe turns out to be as literal an implementation of a convolutional net as one could ever expect from a biological system. The columns of the optic lobe form a hexagonal lattice, rather than the square lattice used in computer vision, but it is a highly regular lattice nonetheless, and the activities of the neurons in each cell type are analogous to a feature map in a convolutional net."
3504,"Although the connectional architecture of the optic lobe conforms closely to the definition of a convolutional net, the connections do not appear to be learned in the sense of artificial intelligence. No changes in VPN structure and function, and only subtle changes in visual behavior have been detected after rearing flies in darkness, suggesting that visual experience may have little role in Drosophila visual development. However, mechanisms based on spontaneous activity in the pupal brain might have a role."
3505,"Implications for mammalian cell types In the central brain of Drosophila, cell types usually consist of just a pair of mirror symmetric neurons, as is also the case for C. elegans. By contrast, most optic lobe cell types are represented by many neurons, a situation that is more reminiscent of mammalian brains."
3506,"Could our connectomic approach generalize to mammalian brain structures such as the retina and cortex, which are laminated like the optic lobe? Single-cell transcriptomics, often hailed as the solution to classifying cortical cell types, has also been applied to the Drosophila optic lobe. One study reported 172 transcriptomic cell types, a figure that includes VPNs as well as intrinsic neurons."
3507,"Our connectomic study has revealed the existence of a much larger set of types. Encouragingly, many connectomic types can be conclusively matched with transcriptomic types. Failures to match are interesting because they illustrate potential pitfalls of the transcriptomic approach."
3508,"For example, all eight T4/T5 types look like a single transcriptomic type in adult flies, and are only transcriptionally distinct at earlier stages of development. This could be analogous to the fact that adult cortical neurons of the same transcriptomic type can have highly variable morphological properties. It will be important to scale up the connectomic approach and make it as definitive for the cortex as it is now for the fly visual system."
3509,"A first attempt has already been made in the visual cortex. As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function."
3510,"Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analyzing its structure to predict that three Dm3 and three TmY cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning, position invariance, and completion of noisy or illusory contours."
3511,"The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision. The 40,000 neurons in the optic lobe of the Drosophila brain have now been completely classified into cell types."
3512,"Although the 200+ cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe are well-defined by structural analysis, their functions are largely unknown because less than 20% have had their visual responses recorded by neurophysiologists. For the most part, at present, the online catalogue of visual cell types is an enigmatic museum of structures without functions. A beautiful example is Dm3, a trio of neuronal cell types that are intrinsic to the distal medulla."
3513,"A Dm3 cell is tangentially oriented and is orthogonal to the columnar cells that project from the medulla to other neuropils. The three Dm3 types are easily distinguished from each other because their dendrites point in three directions. For interactive visualizations of cells and pathways, see the URLs in Supplementary Data 1."
3514,Dm3 was originally called the line amacrine cell when it was discovered in 1970 in dipterans. It was named Dm3 in Drosophila in 1989 and split into two types in 2015. A third Dm3 type was recently identified in a large-scale connectomic census.
3515,No recordings of Dm3 visual responses have ever been reported by physiologists. Dm3 function has remained unknown. I will begin by attempting to predict Dm3 function from structure.
3516,"The field of connectomics has been motivated by a conviction that the computational capabilities of the brain depend strongly on the connectome. Indeed, neural circuit functions such as the computation of visual motion, heading direction, and reward and punishment signals are now known to be supported by specific patterns of neural connectivity in the Drosophila brain. These successes of structural explanation came after neurophysiologists had already identified circuit functions."
3517,"The present study attempts to go beyond explaining post facto. I tackle the challenge of predicting function ex ante, a more stringent test of the power of structure–function relationships. Predictions of Dm3 receptive fields: The receptive field of a visual neuron was classically defined as “the region of the retina which must be illuminated in order to obtain a response.”"
3518,"I predict Dm3 receptive fields by mapping their input connections from Tm1, a cell type that is in one-to-one correspondence with the hexels of the compound eye. Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3, and Dm3 is a strong output of Tm1."
3519,The Tm1 cells presynaptic to each Dm3v cell were mapped to a hexagonal lattice. The color of each hexel indicates the number of synapses received by the Dm3v cell from Tm1 cells. Aligning and averaging all maps yielded an average Tm1–Dm3v input map.
3520,This procedure was repeated for all three Dm3 types. The resulting average maps show that the three Dm3 types are aligned to the three cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. Cell-to-cell variation is visible in the individual maps for single Dm3 cells.
3521,"To quantify variability, each Tm1–Dm3 connectivity map was approximated as an ellipse. The distributions of angular orientations for the Dm3 populations overlap little, and the median angles are close to the cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The aspect ratios of the ellipses have median values near 4 for all Dm3 populations."
3522,"To further characterize the size and shape of the predicted receptive fields, one-dimensional projections of Tm1–Dm3 maps were computed. The longitudinal and transverse projections provide information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively. Standard deviations are marked to provide information about variability across cells."
3523,"The Tm1 receptive field is radially symmetric, with a center that is about one ommatidium wide. As this is so narrow, Tm1–Dm3 connectivity maps can be regarded as estimates of Dm3 receptive fields, assuming that a Dm3 cell sums inputs from its presynaptic Tm1 cells. Orientation selectivity was discovered in mammalian primary visual cortex and found to be related to the spatial orientation of the receptive field."
3524,"As the predicted receptive fields of Dm3 are oriented, I likewise predict that Dm3 cells prefer stimuli at the three cardinal orientations. Although Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3 by a large margin, Dm3 also receives weaker input from other ""hexel cell types."" Maps of their connectivity with Dm3 look similar to Tm1–Dm3 maps."
3525,"Like Tm1, these inputs are known to have receptive field centers that are roughly a single ommatidium in width and therefore are not expected to change the shape of the receptive field estimated from Tm1. All of these inputs are consistent with the prediction that Dm3 cells have OFF receptive fields. Predictions of TmY receptive fields: Top targets of Dm3 include TmY4 and TmY9, which project from the distal medulla to the lobula and lobula plate."
3526,"In the distal medulla, TmY4 dendrites are horizontally oriented, extending symmetrically on two sides of the main trunk. TmY9 has been split into TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. In the distal medulla, both TmY9 types have dendrites that are asymmetrically directed to one side of the main trunk along the q and q⟂ directions."
3527,"Tm1 is one of the top inputs to TmY4 and TmY9. Once again, I predict receptive fields by mapping Tm1 inputs. The average maps have three distinct orientations."
3528,"Cell-to-cell variability is visualized by approximating ellipses. The median orientations of the TmY4 and TmY9q⟂ ellipses are well approximated by the horizontal and q⟂ orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The median orientation of the TmY9q ellipses is between the q and p⟂ orientations, and closer to q."
3529,"Roughly speaking, each TmY orientation is orthogonal to one of the Dm3 orientations, although the orthogonality of TmY9q and Dm3p is less than perfect. Aspect ratios of the ellipses indicate the degree of anisotropy. Longitudinal and transverse 1D projections of Tm1–TmY maps provide complementary information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively."
3530,"From these estimates of receptive fields, TmY4, TmY9q, and TmY9q⟂ are predicted to prefer visual stimuli at the horizontal, q, and q⟂ orientations, respectively. On the basis of their strong Tm1 inputs, TmY4 and TmY9 are predicted to be OFF cells, although they also receive input from the ON hexel type Mi1. Monosynaptic inputs to individual TmY cells from Tm1, Mi1, and other hexel types are mapped in Supplementary Data 4."
3531,"Connectivity between Dm3 and TmY types: Dm3 and TmY neurons are also connected with each other. Dm3 will be presumed inhibitory in its synaptic effects on other cells, and TmY will be presumed excitatory, based on evidence from both electron micrographs and transcriptomic data. Each Dm3 type avoids synapsing onto cells of the same type and prefers to synapse onto the other two Dm3 types, which have different dendrite orientations."
3532,"Each Dm3 type prefers to synapse onto a single TmY type, that with the orthogonal dendrite orientation. Therefore, Dm3 output connectivity conforms to cross-orientation inhibition, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 50 years ago. TmY cells prefer to synapse onto TmY cells of the same type."
3533,"It follows that TmY–TmY connectivity conforms approximately to iso-orientation excitation, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 40 years ago. In addition, there is some weaker connectivity from TmY9q to TmY9q⟂. TmY4 and TmY9q cells synapse onto Dm3 cells of the orthogonal orientation."
3534,"By contrast, TmY9q⟂ shows no preference, synapsing onto Dm3 cells of all orientations. Therefore, TmY-to-Dm3 connectivity is a combination of cross-orientation and indiscriminate connectivity. The above connectivity patterns are represented schematically in Fig. 3b. This is effectively a thresholded version of Fig. 3a that will be used in subsequent analyses."
3535,"Figure 3c illustrates a Dm3 cell synapsing onto another Dm3 cell, which in turn synapses onto a TmY cell. Figure 3d illustrates reciprocally connected TmY4 cells. These visualizations suggest that there are spatial relationships between the connected cells, which are not described by population-level wiring diagrams."
3536,The consequences of these spatial relationships for visual responses of cells will be predicted below. Dm3 extraclassical receptive fields: The receptive field predictions of Figs. 1 and 2 were for the “classical” receptive field.
3537,"For some visual neurons, stimulation of areas outside the CRF may modulate the response to stimulation of the CRF. These areas are sometimes called the “extraclassical” receptive field. By definition, stimulating the ERF alone should not result in any response."
3538,"The amount of modulation induced by ERF stimulation may depend on the orientation, contrast, or other properties of the modulating stimulus. Locations outside an oriented CRF near the longitudinal axis will be called the end zones, and locations near the transverse axis will be called the side zones. I propose that the ERF of Dm3 cells is determined by disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3."
3539,"I searched for such pathways with the greatest anatomical strength. In brief, the strength of the A-to-B connection was defined as the fraction of input synapses to cell type B provided by cell type A."
3540,"The strength of the A-to-B-to-C disynaptic pathway was then defined as the product of the A-to-B and B-to-C strengths. Details about this strength estimate and its limitations are provided in the Methods. Strong disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 were mapped, aligned, and averaged across Dm3 cells."
3541,"For each Dm3 type, the average disynaptic pathway map overlaps with the average predicted CRF but also extends beyond it. The beyond-the-CRF portion of each disynaptic pathway map will be regarded as a component of the predicted ERF. Henceforth, ""pERF"" and ""pCRF"" will be used as abbreviations for the predicted ERF component and predicted CRF, respectively."
3542,"As the maps do not have sharp borders, they will be approximated as ellipses for the purpose of defining beyond-the-CRF regions. For each Dm3 type, the strongest two pERFs are from the other two Dm3 types. These mostly extend into the side zones of the pCRF and are predicted to be suppressive because Dm3 is presumed inhibitory."
3543,Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. The next strongest pERF is mediated by T2a and is predicted to be facilitating because T2a is presumed excitatory. The T2a-mediated average pERF covers both end zones of the Dm3v pCRF and mainly the posterior end zone of the Dm3p and Dm3q pCRFs.
3544,"Ellipse approximations to Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps for individual Dm3 cells show that their orientations tend to be similar to those of the Dm3 pCRFs. For some Dm3p and Dm3q cells, the Tm1–T2a–Dm3 map is small and located in the pCRF end zone, not overlapping with the pCRF at all. This shows up as a hotspot in the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps."
3545,"One-dimensional projections of the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps show that they tend to be longer than the pCRFs and result in pERFs that are biased toward the posterior pCRF end zone of Dm3p and Dm3q. The remaining disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 are substantially weaker in anatomical strength, but are included for completeness because they might turn out to be physiologically strong. It is not easy to predict the overall effect at locations where suppressive and facilitating pERFs overlap."
3546,"I predict that suppression will be prominent in the pCRF side zones, where the Dm3-mediated pERFs seem numerically stronger. In the end zones, the T2a-mediated pERFs are largely unopposed by suppression and should lead to facilitation that is not selective for the orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus. pERFs for individual Dm3 cells are provided in Supplementary Data 3."
3547,"There is considerable variability across cells of the same type, but the geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. To predict the ERF of TmY cells, I consider disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to TmY types. The strongest pathways are mediated by Dm3, and the resulting pERF covers mainly the pCRF side zones and is expected to be suppressive."
3548,"Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. Of the weaker pERFs that are facilitating, the TmY–TmY pERF extends the farthest into the pCRF end zones. Ellipse approximations show the degree of variability across cells."
3549,"1D projections show that the pERF extends into both end zones. This pathway could lead to iso-orientation facilitation in the end zones, as the TmY–TmY connections are between the same TmY type. The extension of the facilitating TmY–TmY pERF into the pCRF end zones is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity aids in the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
3550,"A similar ""collinear facilitation"" in the visual cortex has been proposed to enable the completion of noisy or illusory contours, because an orientation detector receiving weak or ambiguous input from the image can be driven over threshold by excitation from neighboring orientation detectors. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones. This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity."
3551,"pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in Supplementary Data 4. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. Prediction of spatial normalization: The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute."
3552,"Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation. In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY."
3553,"A similar excitatory–inhibitory motif is found for many types in the Dm interneuron family and can be viewed as implementing spatial normalization, a common computation in image processing. The inhibitory neuron pools the activity of excitatory neurons over some spatial neighborhood and sends recurrent inhibition back to the same excitatory neurons. An unusual aspect here is that recurrent inhibition in the Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY pathway is opposed by recurrent excitation in the Tm1–TmY–TmY pathway in the case of side-by-side stimuli at the preferred orientation."
3554,"Pathways leaving the optic lobe: I have predicted that the three Dm3 and three TmY types respond selectively to the local orientation of a visual stimulus. This is conceptualized as a decomposition of the image into small oriented elements such as edges or bars, similar to early visual processing as well as models of the visual cortex. In such models, the computation of local orientation is a general starting point for recognizing all visual forms by subsequent processing steps."
3555,"Similarly, information about local stimulus orientation might be used by the fly brain for form vision. TmY cells synapse onto a number of visual projection neurons that project out of the optic lobe into the central brain. I will focus on the most numerous of these VPN types, LC15 and LC10e, which number about 50 cells each."
3556,"These are of particular interest because they retain more information about location and are therefore potentially more useful for recognizing complex visual forms. The other VPNs, by contrast, discard more information about location by pooling widely over space and will be studied elsewhere. LC15 invariance to orientation: LC15 neurons project from the lobula to the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, a neuropil in the central brain."
3557,"LC15 receives input from all three TmY types. Direct connections from hexel types to LC15 are weak or non-existent, so here the top disynaptic pathways are mapped to predict feature selectivity. Aligning and averaging the maps yields the figure."
3558,Maps for individual cells are in Supplementary Data 5 and are summarized by ellipses in Fig. 6c.
3559,"Given that LC15 input from TmY cells of all three orientations is indiscriminate, it is natural to reason that LC15 responds indiscriminately to any orientation, detecting a disjunction of activity in the three channels. If TmY orientation tuning is sufficiently broad, it follows that LC15 should be activated by a stimulus of any orientation. Indeed, recordings of LC15 visual responses show that LC15 is activated by bars of any orientation."
3560,"Other strong intermediaries of disynaptic pathways include T3, Tm25, and Tm21. T3 is known to be a small-object detector, and Tm25 and Tm21 may be object detectors based on their connectivity. Indeed, recordings of LC15 responses show that LC15 is also activated by small objects, although not as strongly as by bars."
3561,LC10e is a possible junction detector. LC10 neurons project from the lobula to the anterior optic tubercle of the central brain. LC10 has been divided into four types with distinct stratification profiles in the lobula. I identified a new LC10e type and further subdivided it into dorsal and ventral variants based on their distinct connectivity patterns.
3562,"Both variants receive inputs from TmY9 types, but these inputs are stronger for LC10ev, so I will focus on it. Disynaptic pathways starting from hexel types were mapped, and the top intermediaries turned out to be TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. The maps were aligned and averaged."
3563,The average Tm1–TmY9q–LC10ev map is to the left of the average Tm1–TmY9q⟂–LC10ev map. The displacement vectors between ellipse centers are within 90° of the q direction for almost all LC10ev cells. This suggests a systematic spatial relationship between the receptive field components mediated by TmY9q and TmY9q⟂.
3564,"Noisiness in this relationship is evident in the maps for individual cells, but many individual cells are consistent with the systematic relationship. Although LC10ev receives input from both TmY9q and TmY9q⟂, it is unclear how these two pathways interact. One possibility is that LC10ev, like LC15, detects a disjunction of activity in two pathways and responds to a stimulus at either the q or q⟂ orientation."
3565,"Another possibility is that LC10ev detects a conjunction of activity in the two pathways. In the latter case, LC10ev could be a detector of corners or T-junctions, owing to the systematic spatial relationship evident in the figures."
3566,"This is just speculation, as there are additional strong inputs to LC10ev other than TmY9, and it is unclear how they shape the feature selectivity of LC10ev. TmY pERFs mediated by T4 and T5 cells cover the pCRF end zones and are facilitating. T4 and T5 neurons are activated by motion and are also known to prefer oriented stimuli."
3567,"Therefore, input from the motion system may enhance the orientation selectivity of TmY cells and may also cause TmY responses to be stronger for moving stimuli than for flashed stimuli. Dm3 inputs and outputs do not contain cell types known to encode motion direction. TmY4 receives inhibition from several lobula plate interneurons, including the full-field cells LPi14 and LPi15, which are presumed to be inhibitory and receive strong input from T4a and T5a, and from T4b and T5b, respectively."
3568,"This suggests that TmY4 might be suppressed by horizontal background motion. TmY9q⟂ receives input from LPi07, suggesting that TmY9q⟂ might be suppressed by vertical background motion if LPi07 is inhibitory, because LPi07 receives input from T4c and T5c, as well as from T4d and T5d. TmY outputs include motion-related types."
3569,"TmY4 synapses onto LPi07 cells, which synapse onto T4c and T5c, and from T4d and T5d. TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ synapse onto a number of types that are reciprocally coupled to T4 and T5 cells. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones."
3570,This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity. pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in Supplementary Data. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells.
3571,"Prediction of spatial normalization The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute. Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation."
3572,"In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY.

3589,"Recordings of these additional intermediary types have not been reported, but a companion paper uses connectivity to speculate that they are involved in color vision. Predictions and their limitations: By interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram, I have predicted visual responses of Drosophila neurons that have not previously been recorded by neurophysiologists."
3590,"Testing these predictions seems bound to be informative, whether or not they turn out to be correct. CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted by mapping monosynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells and found to be oriented. On this basis, Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted to be orientation selective."
3591,"pERFs were predicted by mapping disynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells, which involve connections in the Dm3–TmY circuit. A Dm3 pERF mediated by other Dm3 types was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to non-preferred orientations. A Dm3 pERF mediated by T2a was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and not tuned to the orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus."
3592,"A TmY pERF mediated by TmY was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and near side zones, and tuned to modulating stimuli at the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF mediated by Dm3 was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to modulating stimuli orthogonal to the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF due to a trisynaptic pathway mediated by both the same TmY type and the orthogonal Dm3 type was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones for stimuli at the pCRF orientation."
3593,"Although my predictions are powerfully concrete and specific, they also have limitations. First, I relied on the fundamental assumption that the CRF arises from monosynaptic connectivity and that the ERF arises from polysynaptic pathways that are not paralleled by a monosynaptic connection. One can be confident about the assumption for an inhibitory pathway such as Tm1–Dm3v–TmY4, which by itself should be incapable of activating the TmY4 cell."
3594,"However, stimulating an excitatory pathway such as Tm1–TmY4–TmY4 could conceivably activate the final TmY4 cell, even if the direct Tm1–TmY4 pathway is not stimulated. In general, my fundamental assumption is more certain for inhibitory and less certain for excitatory polysynaptic pathways. If experiments show that the size and shape of CRFs match the predictions, then the fundamental assumption will be upheld, and further experiments can proceed to look for the predicted facilitating and suppressive ERF components. On the other hand, if the CRF turns out to be longer than predicted, that would mean excitatory polysynaptic pathways, which were predicted to contribute to the ERF, instead turn out to lengthen the CRF. The prediction of a facilitating ERF in the CRF end zone would become invalid because the end zone would be swallowed up by the lengthened CRF."
3595,The ERF would then be determined solely by inhibitory polysynaptic pathways and be only suppressive. The above uncertainty is related to some ambiguity inherent in the ERF definition. It is supposed to be impossible to evoke a neural response through stimulation of the ERF alone.
3596,"If the definition is revised to substitute ""difficult"" for ""impossible,"" the distinction between ERF and CRF is no longer black and white. In the second limitation, predictions can be challenging owing to the existence of many polysynaptic pathways that can contribute to the ERF. When relevant pathways are both excitatory and inhibitory, it can be difficult to predict the overall sign of modulation by a stimulus outside the CRF."
3597,"I have accordingly focused my ERF predictions on locations where either excitation or inhibition is likely to dominate. However, there are additional ERF pathways that were not considered above. For example, a companion paper predicts numerous normalization mechanisms that are presynaptic to the Dm3–TmY circuit: Tm1 responses are spatially normalized by five Pm interneuron types that pool over multiple length scales, L2 is normalized by three Dm interneuron types, and the L2–Tm1 connection is normalized by two Dm interneuron types."
3598,"All of these mechanisms are expected to contribute suppressive ERF components that are not tuned to stimulus orientation and could obscure the predicted facilitating ERF components. A third limitation concerns variation across cells of the same type, which is summarized by the ellipses in Figs. 1h, 2j, 4d, 5d, 6c,f and detailed in Supplementary Data 3–5."
3599,"A systematic kind of variation is the distortion of geometric relationships near the borders of the eye. There is also apparently random variation even in the interior of the eye, far from the borders. pERFs tend to look more variable than pCRFs, which may be due in part to randomness in the coverage of the visual field by non-hexel types."
3600,"Finally, my conjecture about LC10e assumes a high threshold for activation, which suggests that LC10e should detect a conjunction of TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ activation, triggered by two oriented stimuli arranged in a corner or T-junction. Alternatively, LC10e might detect a disjunction of its inputs if it has a low threshold for activation. LC15 is indiscriminately connected with all three TmY types, and its observed invariance to stimulus orientation suggests that LC15 has a low threshold for activation."
3601,"An additional subtlety, not further discussed here, is that threshold actually varies dynamically owing to the presence of inhibitory inputs. In principle, some of the above limitations could be overcome by building network models of neural activity. That might not improve the predictive power at this time, however, because so many model parameters are unknown at present."
3602,"Synapse counts are only crude estimates of physiological connection strength, and unitary conductance can differ markedly between inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Other uncertainties, such as whether inhibition should be modeled as subtractive or divisive, go beyond parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out experiments that reduce model uncertainty."
3603,"If visual physiologists measure orientation and location tuning curves, that would constrain the strength of cross-orientation inhibition relative to direct Tm1 excitation, as well as the relative strengths of ERF pathways. Biophysical experiments would clarify the extent to which voltage varies throughout a neuronal arbor, which is important because pCRF and pERF pathways may terminate in synapses at different locations on the arbor. Discussion: Convolutional nets are a popular approach to form vision in artificial intelligence."
3604,"Optic lobe cell types can be interpreted as feature maps in a convolutional net, and average Tm1–Dm3 and Tm1–TmY connectivity maps can be interpreted as convolution kernels. LC10e and LC15 combine inputs from TmY cells and may be regarded as complex feature detectors built by combining inputs from simpler feature detectors. This accords with the original hierarchical conception of convolutional nets, which was inspired by hypothetical wiring diagrams for primary visual cortex in mammals."
3605,"The wiring of the Dm3–TmY circuit resembles connectivity motifs originally proposed for V1, and some visual responses predicted here for fly neurons have precedents in V1. In particular, ‘collinear facilitation’ is predicted for the ERF of TmY cells, meaning that a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the end zone can facilitate the response to a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the CRF. Collinear facilitation was previously reported for V1 neurons, but most reports emphasize suppression."
3606,"The conflicting reports might be reconciled if ERFs are generated by diverse parallel polysynaptic pathways. Different visual stimuli might emphasize either excitatory or inhibitory pathways, leading to different experimental results. The ERFs of TmY cells are similarly predicted to be shaped by many overlapping excitatory and inhibitory pathways, but the complexity is constrained by the connectome."
3607,"We can reason about the cell types and connections, observe and manipulate them with the aid of genetic tools, and use them to build neural network models. This new opportunity has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods used to disentangle the effects of overlapping ERF mechanisms in the cortex, such as manipulating stimulus contrast, orientation, and timing. ‘Line amacrine’ cells, probably homologous to Dm3, have been described in several dipteran species."
3608,"If Dm3 and TmY homologues turn out to exist in honeybees, it will be worth comparing them with studies of honeybee behavior, with the caveat that visual acuity is higher and inter-ommatidial spacing is lower in honeybees than in Drosophila. Behavioral experiments were interpreted to infer the existence of “at least three orientation-sensitive channels” in the bee visual system. Orientation-selective neurons were later predicted to span a maximum of three ommatidia."
3609,"This roughly matches the predicted CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells. It is worth noting that Dm3 receptive fields would not previously have been guessed to be so short, because Dm3 dendrites are quite long. The predicted CRFs require true connectivity, not just morphology."
3610,"The collinear facilitation predicted for TmY cells could have consequences for insect visual behaviors. Bees were once claimed to perceive illusory contours. The experiments were later declared to be irreproducible, although this belated renunciation seems to have escaped notice."
3611,The topic seems worth reopening if neurophysiology experiments can detect the collinear facilitation predicted here. The design of illusory contour stimuli seems more likely to be successful if guided by neurophysiology as well as behavior. Behavioral experiments with honeybees were used to argue that the orientation of a visual stimulus is computed independently from its direction of motion.
3612,"Orientation selectivity was subsequently discovered in direction-selective T4 and T5 cells of Drosophila. The present work predicts an orientation-selective Dm3–TmY circuit that is indeed distinct from the motion circuit, although there are interactions between them as described above. The Dm3–TmY circuit immediately suggests many questions about neural development."
3613,"Unknowns include the identities of the molecules that guide Dm3 dendrites to grow in three directions, and how the Dm3 dendrites ‘decide’ how far to grow, even after turning sharply at the border of the medulla. The molecules that establish connectivity preferences of Dm3 and TmY cells are of obvious interest. There should also be molecules that establish preferences for synapse formation at particular dendritic locations, which are important for the spatial organization of connectivity and remain to be analyzed in future work."
3614,"Many animals use visual information to navigate, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction by integrating visual input from ER neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data."
3615,"The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle in the central brain; TuBu neurons, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes, and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input."
3616,"We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations. The AVP encodes visual features that are essential for navigation, potentially including landmarks, intensity gradients, color, celestial bodies, and skylight polarization."
3617,"Considering its fundamental role in navigation, it is not surprising that this anatomical structure is largely conserved across most known insect species. It is likely that deep similarities exist across species in the basic logic of visual feature extraction for navigation. However, despite many studies of the AVP across species, researchers’ knowledge about the AVP neurons has been fragmented by the lack of a complete circuit diagram to frame systematic investigations."
3618,"Here we aim to provide such a framework in flies, and we anticipate that this will also be invaluable for designing and prioritizing physiological experiments to interrogate the AVP in other species. We identified all neurons and their connectivity in the AVP, using a publicly available electron microscopy dataset that contains the entire adult fly brain, with FlyWire, an AI-assisted collaborative platform. MeTu neurons, the first stage of the AVP, leave the medulla, the largest neuropil in the fly visual system."
3619,"The axons of MeTu neurons innervate the AOTUsu, where the information is further processed by the TuBu neurons that connect the AOTUsu to the bulb. There are ten classes of TuBu neurons, each synapsing onto the dendrites of distinct classes of ER neurons. ER neurons then send ring-like processes to a donut-shaped structure, the ellipsoid body, where they together form a complex recurrent neural network."
3620,"Finally, the visual information from the AVP—along with other sensory modalities—is compiled to compute the heading direction by EPG neurons that share many similarities with mammalian “head direction” cells. Our survey of the entire brain showed that visual information originating from optic lobe structures outside the AVP constitutes minimal input to EPG neurons. Thus, we focused our analyses on the medulla-originating AVP."
3621,"Furthermore, although previous anatomical studies of various types of MeTu neurons have generally agreed at the macroscale, the insufficient resolution of light microscopy has resulted in considerable inconsistencies in grouping MeTu types and predicting their connectivity towards the central complex. Hence, we sought to provide a comprehensive view of this pathway in synapse-level detail. Finally, although the connectivity from TuBu to ER to EPG neurons has been studied at synaptic resolution, this dataset contains only one hemisphere and lacks upstream medulla neuropils and photoreceptor terminals."
3622,"Therefore, we sought to reconstruct the entire AVP in both hemispheres to provide a solid foundation for understanding how brains vary across hemispheres and across animals, as well as which visual features are extracted in the AVP. We densely proofread all MeTu neurons, TuBu neurons, and ER neurons. We further reconstructed all medulla-intrinsic Mi1 neurons in the medulla from both hemispheres to map the exact locations of all reconstructed neurons relative to the retinotopic columns in the medulla."
3623,"To assess our proofreading quality, we selected 113 MeTu neurons from the right hemisphere and performed multiple rounds of proofreading. We found that—after the first round—any additional volume reconstructed in each round markedly decreased, and there were no changes in the main backbone. Moreover, all MeTu neurons shared stereotypical arborization patterns in the medulla."
3624,"Therefore, we were confident that our reconstruction quality of the 894 MeTu neurons was sufficiently accurate for categorization and morphological and connectivity analyses. We focused on the detailed connectivity of MeTu neurons because the logic of their connections between optic lobes and the central brain was missing in previous studies. We included results from both hemispheres in most analyses, but, where indicated, some detailed analyses were restricted to the right hemisphere because the left hemisphere had an incomplete lamina and EM image alignment issues."
3625,"AOTUsu anatomy defines four MeTu classes. The AOTUsu is innervated by four types of processes: the axons of MeTu neurons, the dendrites of downstream TuBu neurons, and the synaptic terminals of bilaterally projecting AOTU and tubercle-to-tubercle neurons. Drawing on the axonal arborization pattern of MeTu and the dendritic arborization pattern of TuBu, we divided the AOTUsu into four major subregions: posterior lateral, posterior central, anterior, and medial. These anatomical divisions led us to categorize MeTu neurons into four major classes."
3626,"Downstream TuBu neurons were categorized into ten types, consistent with previous works."
3627,"Connectivity reveals ten MeTu subtypes. Within each MeTu class except MeTu1, we observed discrete morphologies and anatomical innervations, suggesting multiple channels for visual features. To systematically categorize all possible MeTu neuron subtypes, we focused our analysis on the five strongest synaptic partner types; this resulted in 28 types of upstream neurons. Applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction analysis based on the connectivity in the medulla but not in the AOTUsu revealed four major patterns of presynaptic inputs, mostly consistent with the four major MeTu classes defined in the previous section."
3628,"We also performed categorization analyses and found ten subtypes. Comparing the expression pattern of genetic driver lines with EM data further corroborated our subtyping of MeTu neurons. MeTu1 neurons form a homogeneous group. Compass neurons are strongly influenced by vertical stripes and their locations in azimuth, whose information is conveyed by ER neurons, probably ER4d."
3629,"This ER neuron type is the only partner downstream of TuBu08, which is, in turn, the only neuron type downstream of MeTu1 neurons. Our analysis of the anatomy and connectivity of MeTu1 neurons helps to explain the mechanisms that underlie the selectivity of ER4d neurons. MeTu1 neurons form thick dendritic branches in the medulla layer 7, with small vertical protrusions extending to layer 6. Dendrites span about 30–40 medulla columns, and each medulla column is innervated by multiple MeTu1 neurons."
3630,"MeTu1 neurons receive the strongest input from Dm2 neurons covering the entire visual field, followed by Sm16, MeTu1, Sm15, and Sm07. The density of synapses drops at a distance of 20 to 30 μm from the medulla centroid of a MeTu1 neuron. The functional implication of recurrent connections between MeTu1 neurons in the medulla remains to be examined."
3631,"The orientation of the MeTu1 dendritic span, when fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, tends to be vertical. We observe that near the anterior and posterior edges, the dendritic spans of MeTu neurons narrow, but future studies are required to ascertain whether this change has functional implications. MeTu1 neurons project axons to the AOTUsu_PL, where they synapse with TuBu08 neurons, among other connections."
3632,"The connection from MeTu1 neurons to TuBu08 neurons is retinotopic; the more anteriorly or posteriorly MeTu1 dendrites are located in the medulla, the more ventrally or dorsally they project in the AOTUsu_PL, respectively. In other words, each TuBu08 neuron receives input from a group of MeTu1 neurons at a particular azimuth, regardless of their elevation in the medulla. Such one-dimensional mapping provides a potential anatomical basis for the selectivity of TuBu08 neurons to vertical bars or to the azimuthal location of visual stimuli, but not to elevation, an anatomical structure similar to the classic model of how simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus."
3633,"MeTu2 subtypes process polarized light. Many insects navigate relying on skylight polarization. In Drosophila, ER4m neurons are the prominent ER neurons that process skylight polarization. MeTu2 neurons, previously designated as MeTu-DRA, are notable as the only upstream inputs of these ER neurons."
3634,"They are clustered in the dorsal half of the medulla, with dendrites mainly tiling the dorsal rim area, where neurons process skylight polarization. Our clustering analysis identified two MeTu2 subtypes with distinct ramifications in the medulla and notably distinct connectivity patterns in the AOTUsu_PC, which we named MeTu2a and MeTu2b. Both subtypes exhibit generally vertical arborizations and similar dendritic spans, but the interconnectivity among MeTu2b neurons in the medulla is much stronger than that among MeTu2a."
3635,"Furthermore, MeTu2b neurons appear to receive more input from MeTu2a than they provide input to MeTu2a. Finally, although both MeTu2 subtypes mainly stratify within medulla layer 7, MeTu2a neurons are postsynaptic to polarization-sensitive R7 neurons only in the DRA and local interneurons DmDRA1, both of which are potentially sensitive to light polarization, whereas MeTu2b inputs also include Mi15, the function of which remains unknown, and a stronger connection from interhemispheric MeMeDRA. Hence, MeTu2b might integrate additional inputs from the contralateral hemisphere, enabling the processing of a more global skylight polarization pattern."
3636,"MeTu2 innervation of the AOTUsu respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1. Also, as in the medulla, MeTu2b neurons are more strongly interconnected in the AOTUsu than are MeTu2a neurons. Moreover, although MeTu2a and MeTu2b both synapse onto TuBu01 and TuBu06, MeTu2b is only weakly connected to TuBu01."
3637,"Finally, MeTu2a and MeTu2b differ in their connections to the bilateral neurons TuTuB_a and TuTuB_b. Overall, these connectivity differences in the AOTUsu_PC, combined with their distinct anatomical features in the medulla, indicate that MeTu2a and MeTu2b are likely to convey distinct features of skylight polarization to downstream circuits, with MeTu2b potentially processing more complex and global polarization patterns. MeTu3 neurons comprise three subtypes. The Drosophila compass neurons can use the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding world to compute head direction, but the source of this information was unclear."
3638,"Here, we provide evidence that MeTu3 and its downstream neurons process, in addition to skylight polarization, the two-dimensional organization of the scene. Our connectivity analysis identified three distinct MeTu3 subtypes with regionalized clusters of dendrites. MeTu3a has dendrites that cluster in the dorsal third of the medulla, are confined to layer 7, and specifically lack vertical protrusions across medulla layers."
3639,"MeTu3a is the only MeTu3 subtype that receives polarization information through input from DmDRA1, similar to MeTu2a and MeTu2b. MeTu3b cells have dendrites that are clustered most densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend to the ventral two-thirds, with pronounced vertical protrusions that cover layers 5, 6, and 7. They receive direct inhibitory input from ultraviolet-sensitive R7 photoreceptors and indirect input from blue/green-sensitive R8 cells through Mi15, which suggests that they have a role in processing chromatic information."
3640,"MeTu3c cells have dendrites that are more ventral than those of MeTu3b, covering the equator and some of the ventral part of the medulla. Dendritic processes innervate the same layers as MeTu3b and receive the same direct and indirect photoreceptor inputs, suggesting similar chromatic coding to that of MeTu3b. MeTu3 innervation of the AOTUsu_A respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1 and MeTu2."
3641,"Axons of MeTu3a, MeTu3b, and MeTu3c are not well segregated in the AOTUsu_A, despite the downstream TuBu neurons having well-segregated dendrites. Consequently, some MeTu3 neurons are connected to two TuBu types. All three MeTu3 subtypes are strongly and reciprocally connected to bilateral TuTuB_a neurons."
3642,"Because the TuTuB_a neurotransmitter is predicted to be inhibitory, MeTu3 neurons might exhibit strong bilateral inhibitory interactions across the entire visual field. MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons are mainly connected to TuBu07, upstream of ER3w_ab. This convergence of MeTu3a and MeTu3b suggests that ER3w_ab encodes a combination of skylight polarization and chromatic information of the sky."
3643,"On the other hand, MeTu3c neurons are mostly presynaptic to both TuBu09 and TuBu10. Notably, TuBu09 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more dorsally in the medulla, whereas TuBu10 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more ventrally in the medulla. Thus, the neurons downstream of MeTu3c can encode the elevation of visual stimuli or a two-dimensional organization of visual objects in a surrounding scene."
3644,"This capability is unique among all MeTu neurons. MeTu4 subtypes transmit widefield inputs. Compass neurons receive diverse input from ER neurons, some of which exhibit responses to the contralateral visual field and self-generated motion signals. Considering that these ER neurons, the dendrites of which are in the inferior bulb, are downstream of MeTu4 neurons that originate in the ipsilateral optic lobe, their response pattern was puzzling."
3645,"Our analyses show that MeTu4 neurons receive inputs from distinct parts of the visual world, with virtually no input from a columnar medulla cell type. Instead, they receive input mostly from large interneurons that span many medulla columns and from others that potentially convey motor information from a neuropil called the superior posterior slope to the medulla. These unique properties of MeTu4 might explain the mysterious properties of ER neurons in the inferior bulb."
3646,"On the basis of the connectivity in the medulla and the AOTUsu_M, we categorized MeTu4 into four subgroups: MeTu4a, MeTu4b, MeTu4c, and MeTu4d. The dendrites of MeTu4a cells cluster densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend ventrally, with unique arborization in two medulla layers. Despite their dorsal location, they form no synaptic connections with polarized light-sensitive photoreceptors or DRA neurons."
3647,"MeTu4b neurons are notable for their unique dendritic arrangement: they span a rather small area in the equator, mostly in the posterior–medial part of the medulla that represents the frontal central visual field. The function of this spatial restriction remains unknown. MeTu4c neurons span the entire dorsal half of the medulla, whereas MeTu4d neurons cluster exclusively in the ventral half of the medulla and are ideally positioned to detect features in the ventral visual field."
3648,"Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d receive nearly identical input from a wide variety of interneurons, including those that convey information from other brain areas. Like all other MeTu types, axonal projections of all MeTu4 neurons maintain anterior–posterior retinotopy in the AOTUsu_M along the ventral–dorsal axis, in contrast to what was found in a previous report. MeTu4a, MeTu4b, and MeTu4c also have presynaptic connections in the lobula, but these connections do not contribute to the AVP and were thus excluded from further analyses."
3649,"In the AOTUsu_M, all MeTu4a neurons are presynaptic to TuBu03; some are also presynaptic to TuBu04. MeTu4b neurons are presynaptic to TuBu02 neurons. Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d subtypes are mainly presynaptic to TuBu05, but MeTu4d also makes presynaptic connections with TuBu02."
3650,"MeTu4b and MeTu4c receive the main interhemispheric connections within the AOTUsu_M: MeTu4b receives strong input from AOTU046 but does not provide reciprocal input into AOTU046, whereas MeTu4c is strongly and reciprocally connected to AOTU046. MeTu4d receives no input from AOTU046 and provides only weak input to AOTU046. Finally, MeTu4d receives weak input from TuTuB_a."
3651,"Variance across hemispheres and brains: We compared the AVP within and across brains. Although our analyses are limited, owing to the lack of optic lobes in the hemibrain dataset and a single optic lobe in the male brain dataset, tentative comparisons are still possible for most MeTu types, on the basis of synapses in the AOTU or optic lobe synapse and cell shapes. The number of neurons of each type was very similar across hemispheres of the same brain, compared to the difference across brains."
3652,"Notably, across brains, only a few cell types showed clear differences in spatial arborization patterns, numbers, or, in very few cases, perhaps even their existence. For example, MeTu4b neurons in FAFB and the male brain optic lobe both have similar spatially restricted arborizations in the medulla, but the FAFB pattern lacks a few cells that are present in the male optic lobe MeTu4b population. Also, the overall number of MeTu4 cells in the male brain dataset is higher, and two other MeTu4 subtypes are identified."
3653,"Careful comparison suggests that MeTu4e in the male optic lobe could be a subset of MeTu4a in FAFB. The source of such variations across brains remains incompletely understood but is likely to be, at least in part, developmental in nature. Extracting visual features along the AVP: A common pattern across all AVP channels is the convergence of MeTu neurons onto a considerably smaller number of TuBu neurons."
3654,"In this transformation, each TuBu neuron integrates information from a large area of the visual field, suggesting spatial feature processing with a lower resolution. TuBu neurons also receive strong input from the contralateral visual field through TuTu neurons. Note that individual MeTu neurons sample the visual area differently depending on their location in the medulla over the anterior–posterior axis."
3655,This results in synapse counts and dendritic field shapes differing by their locations in the medulla along this axis. The effect of this pattern on TuBu integration is not understood at present. The next step in processing—from TuBu to ER neurons—exhibits a re-expansion in the number of neuronal types.
3656,"The ratio of connections from TuBu to ER neurons varies between 0.33 and, for some neurons, 4. Thus, the transformation from TuBu to ER may extract several more visual features."
3657,"Putative receptive fields of ER neurons. To quantify the putative visual area to which each neuron probably responds, we mapped each medulla column to a micro-computed tomography-based eye map of D. melanogaster. Then, for each ER neuron, we back-traced the upstream connections in two ways: one followed TuBu to MeTu connections and the other followed TuBu to TuTu to ipsi- and contralateral MeTu connections."
3658,"We used the dendritic arborization in the medulla for each pathway to estimate the area of a direct pathway or an indirect pathway. We overlaid them into a single putative receptive field, which we further analyzed to obtain the outline of the visual field of the direct pathway. We then combined outlines of the same type of ER neurons to illustrate the visual area that the population of ER neurons covers."
3659,"Note that the lack of functional data for most optic lobe cell types, including Sm neurons, hinders extensive functional predictions. Thus, our predictions are based mainly on the dendritic fields of MeTu neurons and the known properties of presynaptic neurons. Back-tracing the synaptic pathway starting from an ER4d revealed that its upstream MeTu1 neurons are aligned vertically in the medulla."
3660,"They cover about 40° azimuth and the entire vertical span. This vertical arrangement of MeTu1 neurons was consistent across ER4d neurons and covered the entire visual field as a population, like an array of vertical bars. It suggests that ER4d neurons are selective to vertically elongated visual stimuli or to the location of visual stimuli along the horizontal plane, regardless of the elevation."
3661,"Such a pathway would be best suited for detecting visual landmarks that are appropriate references for setting a heading. By contrast, back-tracing starting from single ER2_ad and ER2_b neurons revealed that they receive information from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located in the dorsal medulla, whereas individual ER2_c neurons receive inputs exclusively from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites in the central medulla. Similar to the channel converging into ER4d neurons, the MeTu3c populations upstream of ER2_ad, ER2_b, and ER2_c neurons tile the entire visual field."
3662,"In other words, the ER2 population tiles the visual field two-dimensionally, providing more organizational details of the scene in two dimensions than do ER4d neurons. Furthermore, the roles of ER4d and ER2 in processing chromatic information might differ: Dm2, the main upstream input of MeTu1, receives inputs predominantly from UV-sensitive pale photoreceptors, which suggests that ER4d neurons could process UV stimuli. On the other hand, Mi15, the main upstream input of MeTu3c, receives input from green-sensitive yellow R8 photoreceptors, which suggests that ER2 neurons process longer-wavelength stimuli."
3663,"Unlike the ER4d and ER2 populations, ER4m and ER5 neurons receive strong input from polarization-sensitive channels involving the DRA-specific MeTu2a and MeTu2b neurons, respectively. As described before, MeTu2b exhibits more complex connectivity than MeTu2a and, therefore, might encode complex features of polarized light. Hence, ER5 might process more complex features of polarized skylight, whereas ER4m seems to process skylight polarization alone as a navigational cue, consistent with a previous report."
3664,"This difference is notable because ER5 is involved in circadian rhythms. ER3w receives input from MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons, potentially combining skylight polarization information and localized visual feature information from some of the dorsal visual field. On the other hand, most other ER3 subtypes with dendrites in the inferior bulb are downstream of MeTu4 subtypes that do not receive columnar input in the medulla."
3665,"Thus, until the functions of upstream neurons are understood, the visual area and features that these ER3 neurons encode will remain unclear. Overall, we predict that ER neurons downstream of MeTu1–MeTu3 neurons encode diverse information including polarized light, vertical stimuli or the azimuthal location of visual features, and the two-dimensional organization of visual scenes, including azimuth and elevation, a system suitable for processing both the elevation of a celestial body and the surrounding two-dimensional environment. Physiologically testing predictions. We performed two-photon calcium imaging to test some of these predictions, especially the spatial extent of the visual field to which ER4d and ER2 neurons respond."
3666,"We imaged the dendritic calcium activity of ER neurons in the superior bulb while presenting square-shaped dot stimuli to the fly using a projector-based visual stimulation setup. Both ER neuron types were excited by ipsilateral visual stimuli, consistent with previous studies. The ellipse contours of the receptive fields of ER4d and ER2 tile the visual space differently."
3667,"As predicted by our connectomic analysis, the receptive fields of ER4d neurons are vertically elongated in height and 31 ± 12° in width and tile the visual space horizontally. The receptive fields of ER2 neurons, on the other hand, are markedly smaller and tile the visual space in two dimensions. These results precisely match our predictions about the spatial extent of these neurons’ receptive fields."
3668,"Note that the vertical extent of the ER4d receptive fields is much greater than that reported previously; we believe this is due to the limited span of elevation in the setup used previously. By contrast, we tilted the fly head to expose the eyes to a greater vertical visual span. These results show that informed, systematic predictions can guide experimental designs to reveal previously unexplored dimensions of neural functions."
3669,"We observed four essential organization principles of the AVP: a convergence of spatial information from MeTu to TuBu, which suggests the compression of visual information into features with coarse spatial resolution; segregated and parallel processing of spatially overlapping visual features in largely feedforward circuits; parallel pathways for interhemispheric integration, selectively mixing visual features; and divergent feature expansion through TuBu-to-ER connections. Furthermore, by back-tracing from ER neurons to MeTu neurons, we inferred the diverse visual features that compass neurons might use to compute head direction. Our analysis of the reconstructed synaptic pathways reveals that the fly’s visual field can be roughly subdivided into three regions: a narrow band in the dorsal-most visual field; the remaining upper visual field; and the rest of the visual field."
3670,"Of note, the DRA and upper visual fields are occupied by the large majority of MeTu neuron types with overlapping receptive fields; by contrast, the lower and frontal visual fields are served by fewer cells and subtypes. In particular, MeTu4d neurons cover only the ventral half of the visual field. We speculate that this serves to process ventral optic flow or to orient toward shiny surfaces that produce horizontally polarized reflections, which flies detect and use to adjust their body orientation."
3671,"Nine out of the ten parallel information channels formed by MeTu neurons seem to maintain only azimuth information, discarding information about elevation; this strategy seems particularly efficient for computing a heading in azimuth. Only the MeTu3c channel may encode both azimuth and elevation—a property that seems ideal for perceiving the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding environment or for tracking the position of the celestial body across the day. Overall, these organizational patterns of the AVP suggest that D. melanogaster prioritizes the azimuthal position of celestial cues, including the skylight polarization pattern. Animals exhibit specific cue preferences during navigation, and we have long known that visual features are processed hierarchically: dung beetles prioritize skylight polarization or sun location depending on the environmental context, and mammals prioritize the geometry of the surrounding space. However, the field is only just beginning to investigate which visual features are extracted and how they are prioritized across insects and mammals."
3672,"As such, our complete reconstruction of the AVP in flies is essential for mechanistically understanding the circuit implementation and shared functional principles that underlie the prioritization, integration, and transformation of this information into a heading signal. This is exemplified by our experiments that physiologically confirm some of the new predictions. Furthermore, with the ability to dissect detailed circuit dynamics of neural populations using the rich genetic tools in flies, we are poised to gain a deeper understanding of how sensory information is transformed into more abstract representations, which is fundamental to and essential for higher cognitive functions in the brain."
3673,"Walking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear."
3674,"Here, using connectome-informed models and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implements context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning."
3675,"The brake neurons, by contrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding, and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Walking recruits distributed neural activity across the brain and spinal cord or nerve cord."
3676,"When an animal halts, the net output of this distributed neural activity notably changes to arrest leg-stepping movements. Moreover, depending on the behavioral context, animals halt in different context-appropriate ways. While a few specific neuronal types driving halting have been recently described, how walking-related neural activity changes to allow halting in a manner that is both mechanically stable and appropriate to the behavioral context is currently unclear."
3677,"To identify neurons involved in halting in Drosophila, we optogenetically activated specific neurons that innervate the suboesophageal zone of the fly brain, a region that houses the neurons close to and including the descending output of the brain. Through this neural-activation screen, we identified 11 genetic drivers that were both relatively sparse and caused halting without gross motor deficits. Among these lines, we could unambiguously pinpoint three causal neurons for halting, which we refer to as Foxglove, Bluebell, and Brake."
3678,"We identified split-Gal4 reagents that targeted FG, BB, and BRK with little to no ectopic expression and drove robust halting, as reflected by a decrease in walking velocity, distance, and rotation. Using connectome parsing tools, we identified these neurons in the brain and nerve-cord connectomes. Both FG and BB are SEZ neurons that stochastically descend until the anterior tip of the nerve cord."
3679,"The FG line has weak ectopic expression in the mushroom body neuropil that does not contribute to the halting phenotype. The BB line also labels an additional neuron previously described as ""bluebird."" BRK is a new neuronal type discovered in this work and drives the strongest halting phenotype."
3680,"BRK comprises six ascending neurons with their somata in each of the six leg-segment-specific neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord and axonal projections to the brain SEZ region. By activating subsets of BRK neurons, we found that activating any of the BRK neurons is sufficient to drive halting. Consistent with this, in the connectome, we found that although each BRK receives distinct inputs, all six BRK share common major outputs in their two output zones: the tectulum of the VNC and the SEZ of the brain."
3681,"Analysis of walking velocities on FG, BB, or BRK stimulation hinted at potential differences in the halting phenotypes. To precisely quantify such differences, we performed high-resolution three-dimensional leg kinematics analysis. BRK drove low-latency, long-duration halting bouts with joint angles locked in a specific position for the entire halt duration."
3682,"In contrast, FG and BB-induced halts were interspersed with leg movements. FG drove long halting bouts like BRK but still allowed brief repositioning of legs. BB drove stationary periods interspersed with slow walking and permitted more leg movements."
3683,"Unlike BRK, both FG and BB stimulated flies often took a few steps before halting. Defining the genetic drivers and connectome identities of ""halt"" neurons driving distinct types of halting allowed us to next address their interaction with the walking-promoting circuits. Diversity in walk-halt interactions is important to understand. To address if and how the newly identified halt neurons interact with walking-promoting pathways, we leveraged genetic tools targeting walking-promoting neurons characterized in our previous work, namely P9 that drives forward turning, BPN that drives straight forward walking, and MDN that drives backward walking."
3684,"We combined split-Gal4 reagents for the walk and halt neurons and confirmed opsin expression in the desired neurons. Here, in addition to the three halt neuron driver lines, we used another driver line that targets FG + BB without any ectopic expression to confirm the role of BB. Using these tools, we performed all possible combinations of ""walk + halt"" coactivations."
3685,"BRK stimulation completely suppressed all walking commands, suggesting that it drives a dominant halting mechanism. By contrast, FG and BB activation affected the walk neuron phenotypes with varying degrees and specificity, suggesting distinct halting mechanisms being deployed in these cases. During coactivation with MDN, unlike BRK, FG and BB did not suppress backward walking."
3686,"However, the intermittent switches to forward walking observed during continuous MDN stimulation were absent or markedly reduced, as seen in the individual trial velocity traces. This suggests that FG and BB predominantly suppress forward walking. Consistent with this, when FG or BB were coactivated with P9, the flies showed a marked reduction in forward velocity."
3687,"BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 coactivated flies also showed a corresponding decrease in angular velocity compared to P9-stimulated flies. However, FG + P9 coactivated flies still showed a large increase in angular velocity at stimulation onset. We found that while the BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 flies were predominantly halting during the optogenetic stimulation, FG + P9 flies were pivoting on the spot."
3688,"These observations revealed an unexpected modularity in the P9 downstream pathway into two components: a forward walking component that is suppressed by both FG and BB, and a turning component that is suppressed by BB. As the FG + BB line has a similar phenotype as the BB line, we conclude that BB, and not bluebird, is responsible for the forward turning suppression. When FG or BB was coactivated with BPN, the flies still increased forward walking during optogenetic stimulation."
3689,"Whereas this increase in forward walking tended to be smaller than that of activation of BPN alone, only in the case of FG could we see a statistically significant difference in the distance quantification. Although BPN + FG + BB coactivated flies decreased forward walking, it was interspersed with intermittent jumps, possibly due to ectopic expression in the VNC, rendering the distance quantification unreliable. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FG can partially suppress the BPN-driven forward walking."
3690,"To summarize, we found that BRK suppresses all walking commands, FG specifically suppresses forward walking components of P9 and BPN, and BB predominantly suppresses forward turning induced by P9. The diversity in these walk–halt interactions suggests that the neural targets and mechanisms deployed by the three halting pathways are at least partially distinct. The walk-OFF mechanism, guided by the whole fly brain connectome and the FlyWire toolkit, prompted us to ask if and where the halting and walking pathways might converge."
3691,"We identified, annotated, and proofread all the walk and halt neuronal types and their downstream partners in the connectome. We found no direct connections between the walk and halt neurons. However, all the walk and halt neurons share a common output zone, the SEZ, where they could converge on the same output neurons."
3692,"Even though MDN and P9 are descending neurons that project from the brain to the VNC, they have collaterals in the SEZ through which they recruit other neurons, including DNs. Decapitated MDN flies, in which these SEZ collaterals are eliminated, show backward walking on optogenetic stimulation, indicating that the VNC circuit recruited by MDNs is sufficient for driving the phenotype. However, decapitated P9-activated flies do not show the phenotypic forward turning."
3693,"This implies that the other DNs recruited by P9 SEZ collaterals are critical for the phenotype. Indeed, some P9 downstream DNs were previously implicated in turning. BPN is a higher brain neuron that directly recruits other DNs through SEZ outputs."
3694,"We therefore focused on identifying whether halting pathway projections to the SEZ impinge on DNs recruited by P9 and BPN. To comprehensively analyze the interaction between halting and walking pathways, we used a connectome-constrained whole-brain spiking-network model to reproduce the behavioral coactivation experiments in silico. The model uses the entire connectivity matrix from the FlyWire data and assigns positive or negative weight to the connection based on synapse number and predicted neurotransmitter."
3695,"We validated the neurotransmitter predictions for the halt neurons and confirmed that FG and BB are γ-aminobutyric acidergic neurons, whereas BRK is an excitatory neuronal type. Comparing responses across the top 100 responding neurons in each in silico coactivation experiment shows that all three halt neurons inhibit different, partially overlapping subsets of neurons recruited by the walk pathways. Although the P9 pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by BB, the BPN pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by FG."
3696,"This aligns with the corresponding behavioral phenotypes. We next focused on DNs strongly recruited by the walk pathways and generated synapse-weighted graphs to simultaneously visualize connectivity and predicted firing rate. In the case of P9 coactivation with halt neurons, BB suppressed the firing rate of most of the DNs, whereas FG specifically inhibited a single DN named oDN1."
3697,"The BB result is consistent with the complete suppression of the P9 phenotype in behavioral experiments. Given that FG only suppressed the forward walking component of the P9 phenotype, we infer that oDN1 is mainly relevant for driving forward velocity but not rotational velocity. In the case of DNs recruited by BPN, neither FG nor BB inhibits the whole population."
3698,"This could explain why we never saw a complete suppression of walking in the corresponding behavioral experiments. To probe why FG has a stronger effect in behavioral experiments, we compared the neurons that are differentially affected by FG versus BB. BDN2 stood apart as a DN specifically and strongly inhibited by FG."
3699,"Taken together, the modeling and behavioral data show that FG and BB are positioned to directly inhibit critical nodes in the P9 and BPN walking-promotion pathways, decreasing forward and/or rotational walking velocity. We term this the walk-OFF mechanism. Furthermore, oDN1 and BDN2 stood apart as important nodes to mediate differences in BB and FG effects on the walking pathways."
3700,"We therefore generated split-Gal4 drivers to specifically target these neurons. Optogenetically activating oDN1 and BDN2 drove walking initiation, with BDN2 showing a much stronger phenotype. Even decapitated, oDN1 and BDN2 activated flies initiated robust forward walking, suggesting that unlike P9, the VNC outputs of these DNs are sufficient for forward walking."
3701,"However, on optogenetic silencing, only BDN2-silenced flies showed a reduction in forward velocity. This suggests that BDN2 might be critical during spontaneous walking, whereas oDN1 could be redundant or recruited only in specific contexts. Indeed, on in vivo imaging, we found that BDN2 activity is strongly correlated to the forward velocity of the fly."
3702,"Given that BDN2 is strongly inhibited by FG and not by BB, this could explain why FG drives stronger halting in spontaneously walking flies. In silico coactivating BRK ascending projections, along with P9 and BPN, showed that while BRK is excitatory, it recruits other predicted inhibitory neurons in the SEZ to suppress walking-promotion DNs. When coactivated with P9, BRK inhibits many of the critical walking-promotion DNs, including oDN1."
3703,"However, when coactivated with BPN, BRK inhibits only a subset of DNs, with BDN2 being weakly inhibited. This is in contrast to the strong walking suppression observed in the corresponding behavioral experiments. Crucially, BRK activation suppressed backward walking driven by MDN, whose descending output in the VNC is sufficient to drive backward walking."
3704,"This suggests that, in addition to inhibiting some walking-promoting pathways in the brain, BRK probably acts in the VNC to drive halting. The ""brake"" mechanism: The stepping cycle consists of a swing phase and stance phase. Given the strong ""freezing-like"" BRK phenotype, we wondered whether BRK could cause the legs to ""freeze"" at any point during a stepping cycle, similar to a recent report in mice."
3705,"We found that in the case of BRK mid-swing stimulation, the leg finishes the swing phase in an unaltered manner but freezes as soon as it lands on the ground when the femur-tibia joint is in an extended position. Indeed, in these cases, swing duration is not altered when compared to prestimulus swing duration. However, for BRK mid-stance stimulation, the leg stays locked in place at the onset of the stimulation, leading to a broad Fe-Ti joint distribution across flies and trials."
3706,"This is in contrast to FG stimulation, in which the leg always assumes a relaxed stance position, regardless of when the optogenetic stimulus starts. A similar result was obtained for other leg joints, suggesting it is not a Fe–Ti joint-specific phenomenon. This locking of joints during the stance phase shows that the BRK phenotype is probably due to an active mechanism."
3707,"We proposed that this could be driven by BRK VNC outputs upregulating the postural resistance reflex to lock the leg joints. The term ""resistance reflex"" is used to describe postural reflexes in all legged animals that allow the maintenance of posture while stationary. Upregulating such reflexes could lead to the locking of leg joints during the stance phase, as seen with BRK stimulation."
3708,"To test this hypothesis, we activated either MDN or MDN + BRK in decapitated flies and analyzed their leg kinematics. As reported earlier, decapitated flies showed backward walking on MDN activation. However, decapitated MDN + BRK stimulated flies remained stationary."
3709,"This confirms that a VNC-specific circuit is recruited by BRK to arrest leg movements. During backward walking, the Fe–Ti joint of the front leg is extended before a swing is initiated. We refer to Fe–Ti angles above 107° as the ""swing initiation zone."""
3710,"On MDN + BRK stimulation, the Fe–Ti angle remained locked in place, and in most cases, never reached the SIZ. In the few cases when it reached the SIZ, this rarely led to elevation of the leg. The leg, despite being in an extended Fe–Ti position, still remained firmly perched on the substrate, as indicated by increased dwell time in the SIZ and decreased swing events in the SIZ."
3711,"We performed a complementary analysis for forward walking while activating BDN2 or BDN2 + BRK in decapitated flies. In contrast to backward walking, during forward walking, the SIZ for front-leg Fe–Ti lies in flexed angle values. Despite this difference, coactivation with BRK interrupted forward walking in a manner similar to that seen for backward walking."
3712,"Taken together, this shows that BRK activation led the flies to resist both flexion and extension at the Fe–Ti joint. Resisting such movements would require actively engaging specific leg muscles. We, therefore, activated BRK and monitored front-leg femoral muscle activity with the Fe–Ti joint restrained in either a flexed or extended position."
3713,"In a flexed Fe–Ti position, activating BRK recruited accessory flexor-a and extensor. However, in an extended Fe–Ti position, BRK stimulation recruited accessory flexor-a and accessory flexor-b. Based on the literature, we inferred that accessory flexor-a corresponds to the muscles innervated by slow motor neurons and is also implicated in maintaining joint position."
3714,"The position of accessory flexor-b indicates that they are probably innervated by intermediate and/or fast flexor motor neurons that drive flexion movement and resist forced extension. Extensors, on the other hand, drive Fe–Ti extension and resist forced flexion. Thus, the muscle activity profile driven by BRK resembles a resistance-like state in each Fe–Ti position."
3715,"Even in cases when there was spontaneous, prestimulus muscle activity, BRK drove a concerted change, including the inhibition of highly active muscles and activation of specific muscles to reach this same resistance state-like activity profile. To confirm this represents a resistance reflex-like activity, we passively flexed or extended the Fe–Ti joint and induced resistance reflex while monitoring muscle activity. Here, both control flies and BRK stimulated flies resisted these passive movements and showed a similar recruitment of muscles to that described above, with BRK stimulated flies showing a more robust response."
3716,"Taken together, this suggests that BRK drives a resistance-like state in the femoral muscles. FG or BB activation did not induce any robust muscle activity in similar experiments. Only in cases where there was prestimulus spontaneous muscle activity did FG lead to gradual inhibition of this activity."
3717,"We reasoned this could be because FG inhibits DNs driving the prestimulus spontaneous activity. Combining the kinematics and muscle imaging results, we conclude that BRK drives a stance phase-specific resistance state at the leg joints by means of a VNC-specific neural circuit. FG and BB are required during foraging. We next addressed if and when the animals use the FG, BB, and BRK halting pathways."
3718,"Mining the connectome for inputs to the halting neurons revealed that FG and BB are downstream of the sugar sensory pathway and directly connected to Fdg neurons previously shown to drive halting and proboscis extension for feeding. We therefore activated sugar gustatory receptor neurons both in silico and in vivo. In both cases, FG was strongly recruited, whereas BB showed weak and variable activity."
3719,"Moreover, in vivo, FG showed stronger responses in starved flies compared to fed flies, whereas BB only responded in starved flies. These state-dependent responses could be driven by differences in the feeding drive due to hunger signals impinging on the sugar sensory pathway."
3720,"To understand how different feeding and walking drives might converge on the previously implicated walking-promotion nodes, we coactivated sugar GRNs with either P9 or BPN walk neurons at varying activity levels and monitored oDN1 and BDN2 firing rates, respectively. Both oDN1 and BDN2 were tightly regulated as a function of walking and feeding pathway stimulation, showing that there is an excitation–inhibition balance at these nodes. To test whether FG is critical for relaying the inhibition from sugar GRNs to the walking nodes, we repeated the above simulation while silencing FG in the model."
3721,"This clearly shifted the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking nodes, such that we could now see the release of inhibition on oDN1 and BDN2 when compared to the results in the FG intact model. This suggests that FG may be relevant for halting in the context of foraging and feeding. Because BB is only weakly recruited in our model, we did not see significant changes in BDN2 or oDN1 when we repeated the simulation with BB silenced."
3722,"To confirm the role of halt neurons during feeding, we optogenetically silenced these neurons while providing starved flies with a choice between blank substrate versus sucrose substrate. Control flies or flies with BRK or BB silenced spent most of their time on the sucrose side, whereas FG silenced flies were unable to preferentially stay on the sucrose side, confirming the importance of FG for stopping on sugar detection. At the start of this assay, flies were randomly distributed on the sucrose and blank side, making it difficult to analyze locomotor changes when the fly first encountered the sucrose."
3723,"To analyze these first encounters, we quantified the interaction of flies with a small food blob placed at the center of a large circular arena. All flies slowed down when they first encountered the food blob, probably because, unlike the previous assay, here they could detect the food blob by textural changes and consume it. However, FG- and BB-silenced flies showed shorter stopping bouts and increased velocities near the blob compared to controls."
3724,"Specifically, BB-silenced flies were indistinguishable from controls before food encounter but showed prolonged increases in both translational and angular velocities after the food encounter. This could show a potential role for BB in constraining forward and angular velocities during foraging-type behaviors that involve a local search following food encounter. Such post-food-encounter behavioral state transitions have been well described in flies."
3725,"However, these are not accounted for in our computational model or in the functional imaging experiments. This could explain the weaker BB responses observed in vivo or in silico during sugar-GRN stimulation. Taken together, this confirms that FG and BB are recruited for halting and locomotor control in the context of feeding and foraging."
3726,"Notably, connectomics revealed that this halting pathway diverges from the previously described proboscis extension pathway. In agreement with this, FG or BB silencing had no effect on the proboscis extension response when tethered flies were presented with sucrose. BRK is required during grooming. To understand when flies recruit BRK neurons, we monitored in vivo BRK activity in spontaneous walking and halting flies."
3727,"We imaged a region of the VNC that permits identification of the axons belonging to each of the six BRK neurons. We noticed that BRK is recruited only during a subset of halting events. By annotating synchronously recorded behavior, we found that BRK activity correlated with either ""ball-pushing"" or ""grooming"" events."
3728,"As ball-pushing is probably a special behavior that only happens in a tethered fly walking on an air-supported ball, we focused on the grooming events. BRK activity correlated in a segment-specific manner to the respective grooming events. Most prominent among these were front-leg rubs and hind-leg rubs that coincided with large correlated activity bumps in front and hind BRK, respectively."
3729,"Aligning the BRK activity profile across multiple flies and grooming events showed that the segment-specific BRK activity starts ramping up before the grooming event and is synchronized with a coincident dip in walking velocity. Fittingly, in the connectome, we found that DNg12, a command neuron that drives head-grooming with front legs, provides most input to front BRK, whereas wPN1, a command neuron that drives wing grooming with hind legs, provides most input to hind BRK. We also identified potential leg-grooming sensory-motor pathways from each leg to corresponding segment BRK neurons."
3730,"Thus, BRK neurons receive distinct segment-specific grooming command inputs. However, all BRKs share common outputs that lead to halting with upregulation of postural reflexes. What could be the role of the BRK outputs during grooming?"
3731,"During grooming, flies halt and lift a subset of legs while supporting their body weight on the remaining stationary legs. We wondered whether BRK was necessary for both halting and stability during grooming. We therefore optogenetically silenced BRK in flies that were induced to groom by powdering them."
3732,"BRK silencing did not abolish grooming but led to the interruption of continuous grooming by intermittent walking events, confirming BRK’s role for halting during grooming. Control flies or flies with FG or BB silenced showed prolonged uninterrupted grooming. Moreover, we found that BRK-silenced flies become destabilized during grooming."
3733,"Almost all living organisms, from humans to bacteria, possess a circadian clock. This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops."
3734,"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes, which enable synchronization with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and, in turn, modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is composed of approximately 20,000 neurons."
3735,"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons, likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions, forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations. Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways that generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
3736,"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture, as well as the neuronal network motifs, are highly conserved from humans to insects. Hence, Drosophila melanogaster, with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome, represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways."
3737,"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded as being composed of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized. These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of lateral and dorsal neurons based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression. Furthermore, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently functionally distinct."
3738,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by neuronal signaling molecules that they express. Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogeneous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
3739,"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional dorsal neurons in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is, in fact, composed of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
3740,"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of dorsal neurons as an important hub that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells in the brain, which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center."
3741,"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and neurosecretory cells, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways. Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center, which regulates systemic physiology."
3742,"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded as being composed of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes. Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons."
3743,"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes, each of LN and DN. The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons, dorsoLateral Neurons, Ion Transport Peptide-expressing LN, and Pigment-Dispersing Factor-expressing ventroLateral Neurons. Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1, posterior DN1, DN2, and DN3."
3744,"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types. Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking. Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation, as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far."
3745,"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3. In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. The majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3."
3746,"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain, whereas about six neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain. These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3. Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons."
3747,"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers. In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma. The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons in the adult brain."
3748,"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period and Vrille in tim-Gal4 > GFP-expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times, the inclusion of three clock markers can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3."
3749,"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females. Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome is in line with our DN3 estimate based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3, which we have now classified into five subtypes based on morphological similarity."
3750,"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p that could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types. To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
3751,"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip-out analysis of DN1p using Clk4.1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
3752,MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA and DN1pB subtypes characterized previously. Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes.
3753,"DN1pC and DN1pE are each comprised of two neurons per hemisphere. DN1pD is comprised of four neurons per hemisphere. Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that DN1pD consists of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
3754,"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome is in fact morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4.1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
3755,"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
3756,"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar to each other than to other clock neurons. For example, all three LNd CRY- neurons from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
3757,"Similarly, the two DN2 neurons are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings, which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
3758,"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 neurons cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
3759,"For instance, heterogeneous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivity-based clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s-CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
3760,"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with the classifications determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity, which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded more than four common synapses per neuron as significant connections and more than nine synapses as strong connections."
3761,"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports, we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
3762,"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provides synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres. This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
3763,"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution, which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center that links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p."
3764,"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome. Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses."
3765,"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers of neuronal projections and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome. Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome, including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3. Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3."
3766,"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups. Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes. Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters."
3767,"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
3768,"Taken together, our analyses revealed hitherto unknown connectivity between the clock neurons, which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing: While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
3769,"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons. Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4.1M-Gal4, which labels most DN1p, we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv."
3770,"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes. Similarly, a split-Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv, which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
3771,"While the post-synaptic signal was not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons from the entire network. Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4 lines, including those targeting DN2, LPN, and LNITP."
3772,"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4 and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line. In both cases, trans-Tango generated post-synaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 lines and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a."
3773,"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons, following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper, which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome."
3774,"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network. This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well as neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain. Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups."
3775,"As expected, s-LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons, as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla. In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons."
3776,"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only four sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells which provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE."
3777,"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal superclasses to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including seven aMe neurons that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons."
3778,"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 is similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons. The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum, where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites. Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
3779,"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Conversely, aMe8 receives indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons type 2c. This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
3780,"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks. Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome, which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons. While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
3781,"Regardless, we found little direct inputs from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons. This is consistent with previous findings which revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect. In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
3782,"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+. Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12 and other interneurons."
3783,"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold, reducing the threshold to more than 2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c. The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons. The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons or directly to descending neurons."
3784,"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, the axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time—a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
3785,"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose. The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
3786,"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye. These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of more than 2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
3787,"For example, theoretically, the approximately 300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons, resulting in around 100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial. In silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
3788,"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, particularly the central brain neurons. Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
3789,"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe, consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day. Furthermore, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network. After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types that receive the strongest synaptic inputs from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
3790,"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons, which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these Clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep. Moreover, DN1pB provides strong inputs to tubercle-innervating neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway."
3791,"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions. Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons, which could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons."
3792,"These descending neurons include those that have not yet been classified, as well as Allatostatin-C and SIFamide peptidergic neurons, the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep. Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D and LPN. When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons."
3793,"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory. These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
3794,"Consistent with previous results, we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex and mushroom bodies. Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons and ellipsoid body neurons, as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons."
3795,"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers. Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells that influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis."
3796,"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome. While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor. To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine NSCs in the brain, which are a major source of circulating hormones."
3797,"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSCs based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves, and depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut. Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
3798,"Collectively, the NSCs form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus. We identified all brain NSCs in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons. In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSCs, in agreement with our companion studies."
3799,"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSCs based on their location and neuropeptide identity. While all adult SEZ-NSCs and some l-NSCs can easily be classified based on their morphology and location, this approach is not feasible for m-NSCs since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
3800,"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZ-NSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters. Most l-NSCITP do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m-NSCs comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
3801,"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively. We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSCs comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSCs represents IPCs."
3802,"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2, 3, and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults. Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ. These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades as they represent a heterogeneous population both anatomically and functionally."
3803,"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine whether these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons, we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ. Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
3804,"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain. These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP."
3805,"Therefore, the type and identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC, despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
3806,"The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31, which receive inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives."
3807,"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum, a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending, and sensory neurons. Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
3808,"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons that facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons and descending neurons. Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
3809,"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons, we predicted that peptidergic signaling combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters, 16 of which have high expression of clock genes and can be reliably identified based on known markers. Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide."
3810,"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F. Similar co-expression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters, including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster, which co-expresses CNMamide, AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network."
3811,"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin. DH44 is expressed in several clock clusters, including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN, and LNd NPF. We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody and DH44-T2A-Gal4."
3812,"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters, which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver. Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
3813,"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN, which aligns with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters. Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI. Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons and provide the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
3814,"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSCs that have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSCs are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSCs, we again turned our attention to single-cell transcriptomics."
3815,"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l-NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP based on previously identified markers, and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors. We could not reliably analyze m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZ-NSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
3816,"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSCs. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively, and our analysis agrees with previous expression and functional studies. Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSCs."
3817,"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragment-based Pdfr-Gal4 expression, Pdf receptor transcripts are highly enriched in most clock clusters, which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4."
3818,"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network. However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least seven receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
3819,"Our anatomical mapping of receptors is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor."
3820,"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms. Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome."
3821,"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cut-off of 14 μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study."
3822,"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500 nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
3823,"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas the sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN, and l-LNv. Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres. Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
3824,"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters. These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons: all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons, suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network; we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems, thus making comparisons difficult; and despite our best efforts to account for it, the distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
3825,"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion: Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network. Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly-Wire connectome, we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
3826,"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2 and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3, our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier."
3827,"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters while excluding l-LNv and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN actually represents an important hub in the clock network and displays high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p plays a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity, and DN3 appears important for clock output pathways."
3828,"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge, which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
3829,"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN expresses four neuropeptides."
3830,"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons. Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons. Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2 are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
3831,"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects. This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication rather than the messenger."
3832,"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres. Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l-CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling among clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal decoupling of the two hemispheres—a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies."
3833,"In addition, consistent with previous analysis using the hemibrain connectome, we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals. Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions."
3834,"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days, which was shown to delay the evening oscillators and may lead to internal desynchronization. Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
3835,"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks. Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals, where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons."
3836,"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus. Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian systems are not fundamentally different."
3837,"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants. Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin."
3838,"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies."
3839,"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
3840,"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by the circadian clock. Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
3841,"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii have been established previously. Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
3842,"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach. The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
3843,"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors, and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network and can influence activity-rest rhythms. It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
3844,"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections that were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons of sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways, which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
3845,"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity that could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal, as well as its internal state. In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation, which is linked to various health issues in humans, including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
3846,"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. Our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
3847,The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation.
3848,"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
3849,"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste. This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, none responded to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brain-wide calcium imaging studies."
3850,"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs and silenced each in the Drosophila feeding initiation circuit because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
3851,"Thus, computational modeling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water, and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies."
3852,"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs and a discrete, easily quantified behavioral output: antennal grooming behavior. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics, and functional imaging."
3853,"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as the identification of neurons required for behavioral output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, the detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption."
3854,"Gustatory receptor neurons on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum and the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste center of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance or avoidance, respectively. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focused on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter, and a fourth GRN category labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
3855,"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with the response properties of second-order neurons. When a fly encounters sugar, the activation of appetitive GRNs results in the activation of proboscis motor neurons."
3856,"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum, and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs. We find that the computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9, and 11. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo."
3857,"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focused specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
3858,"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared to the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left or the right hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioral experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed toward the food source. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behavior of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
3859,"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly. Although modeling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did."
3860,"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
3861,"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases the activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8, and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modeled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz."
3862,"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits and modulates a broad range of behaviors, including feeding, oviposition, and foraging."
3863,"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9. Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing."
3864,"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested."
3865,"In general, silencing individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity."
3866,We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behavior. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar and are sufficient for proboscis extension. Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar.
3867,"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9. We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation. Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
3868,"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9. This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
3869,"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
3870,"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions based on connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modeled."
3871,"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype, indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
3872,"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
3873,"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain. We identified 106 of these labeled cell types in the Flywire volume."
3874,"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
3875,"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9; notably, 10 of these 11 cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated. Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
3876,"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these, five do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types with greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
3877,"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity. Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9."
3878,"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs, consistent with the predictions of the computational model. We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labeled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt."
3879,"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing. Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
3880,"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modeling predicted. Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so."
3881,"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose, but Ir94e activation did not. Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
3882,"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
3883,"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, we predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
3884,"Of these, more than half are shared between the two circuits. We also examined bitter-responsive neurons and Ir94e-responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste."
3885,"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
3886,"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9. Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity. Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
3887,"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs. Furthermore, we identified nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation. As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
3888,"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water. Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
3889,"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not. We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1."
3890,"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons. Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments combined with previous experiments confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle, and Zorro."
3891,"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted. Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar and have been found to respond to sugar."
3892,"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioral silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water but not sugar; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
3893,"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water. Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs and may tune the response of these neurons."
3894,"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modeling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs works synergistically to promote MN9 firing."
3895,"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water."
3896,"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose. In total, our computational modeling, optogenetic behavior experiments, and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit."
3897,"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae. These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated as JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2, which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2. There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
3898,"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F, and JO-m subclasses."
3899,"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1, and aDN2 respond to JON activation. To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2. Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2."
3900,"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2, and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity. Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1, a descending member of the BN2 class, and aDN2. Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
3901,"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region."
3902,"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1, raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1."
3903,"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not. Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
3904,"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically. Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
3905,"We demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model based on connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons, and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter, and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
3906,"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modeling indicate that sugar, bitter, and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
3907,"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modeling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
3908,"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways. Connectome models implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model—one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
3909,"The recent creation of connectome datasets has coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model or the signal cascade approach, can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
3910,"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another based on probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength. However, because these models measure traversal length rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain."
3911,"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters and need a clearly defined behavioral task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons and allows for modeling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
3912,"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, researchers use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modeling?"
3913,"Our model failed to predict behavioral results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory or neuromodulatory. We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signaling will be poorly modeled."
3914,"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signaling not accounted for in our model. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics. Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
3915,"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger impinges primarily at sugar-sensing neurons and at select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons are also tuned by thirst. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funneling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
3916,"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modeling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
3917,"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state, or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy."
3918,"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains, but does not dictate, a particular circuit mechanism. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
3919,"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results. Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments, in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84%. Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
3920,"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day-night changes. In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties."
3921,"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms. The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-hour oscillations in a series of genes. These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium."
3922,"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
3923,"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro and recently, in vivo measured circadian calcium rhythms in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels, while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor. These alternative hypotheses may derive from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also due to a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
3924,"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven calcium oscillations. The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups, and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells."
3925,"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays affected by environmental light and by noncell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides. Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we address the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
3926,"In this study, we used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, employing a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods permitted us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 minutes across the 24-hour day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
3927,"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-hour durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as shown in previous studies conducted over much more restricted temporal durations."
3928,"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern. To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes, and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
3929,"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results indicate that the rhythms of slow and fast calcium activity changes show similar daily patterns."
3930,"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases. These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
3931,"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1, and due to the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is uncertain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are indeed distinct. To help clarify the apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
3932,"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that approximately 0."
3933,"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around the same ZT8 to ZT12, at which time this pacemaker group showed peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm. The time course of “fast” calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them. This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
3934,"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and to better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term high-frequency in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-hour intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination."
3935,"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-hour durations. To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME. On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported, except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
3936,"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm. We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited larger amplitude fast calcium fluctuations. Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high."
3937,"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s, could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of photon number collected from an individual region of interest. In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations."
3938,"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi screen to identify potential contributions of different calcium channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
3939,"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources of different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
3940,"In addition, we tested two types of store-operated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment-dispersing factor neuropeptide using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic flies tested under constant darkness."
3941,"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 with one of the two RNAi lines tested. Likewise, the knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ life spans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
3942,"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow calcium rhythms require the inositol trisphosphate receptor."
3943,"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-hour recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones. Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
3944,"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59.3% on average, while their activity phases were still normal. In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons or in all circadian neurons, the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely absent."
3945,"The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37.8% on average, and the coherence was lost within groups. Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons but became largely absent when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons."
3946,"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups, consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations, we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
3947,"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-hour light:12-hour dark time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies. Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
3948,"Fast Calcium Fluctuations Require α1T Calcium Channels and ITPR. Knocking down the RNA for α1T voltage-gated calcium channels in pacemaker neurons impaired circadian rhythms in behavior but did not affect circadian rhythmicity in basal calcium levels within those neurons. Therefore, we next asked whether α1T may underlie the circadian rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations in pacemakers."
3949,"To test this, we again performed imaging across a series of short-term high-frequency calcium measurements on the same flies for a 24-hour day with 1-hour intervals. By comparing control Drosophila with those with α1T knocked down in all circadian pacemaker neurons by tim-GAL4, we found that knocking down α1T did not affect the daily rhythms in the basal calcium level in any pacemaker group except for the DN1, which showed a reduction in the day–night difference of the basal calcium level. These high-frequency measures of slow basal calcium levels largely conform to those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions."
3950,"However, the high-frequency recording revealed that fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the α1T knockdown flies, except for l-LNv. That specific pacemaker group instead displayed higher levels of fast calcium fluctuations. These results indicated that, at least in the majority of circadian pacemaker neurons, α1T is required for strong daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations and that the rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations can be selectively impaired."
3951,"We then asked whether the fast calcium fluctuations are also affected in flies with Itpr knocked down in all pacemaker neurons. We performed the same high-frequency calcium imaging and analysis in Itpr knockdown flies as in α1T knockdown flies. The daily variation of pacemaker calcium was greatly reduced in Itpr knockdown flies, which largely recapitulated previous observations with less frequent sampling."
3952,"In addition, fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the Itpr knockdown flies. These results suggested that rhythms in basal calcium levels, regulated by ITPR, may be necessary for rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations. In this study, we used in vivo 24-hour high-frequency calcium imaging and genetic screening to study the cellular biology of daily calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons of Drosophila."
3953,"We found that the calcium rhythm is, in fact, a composite; it reflects daily fluctuations in both a slow component and a fast one. We interpret fast calcium fluctuations as representations of calcium dynamics that occur as neurons fire single action potentials or bursts of them. While it is not sufficient to resolve single action potentials, GCaMP6-induced fluorescence is a good index of neuronal electrical activity."
3954,"For individual identified pacemakers, these two calcium rhythms share the same daily pattern, yet distinct calcium sources appear to contribute differentially to these two rhythms. An extracellular calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium channels that include the α1T subunit is critical for the fast calcium fluctuations. In contrast, calcium fluxes from the ER via the channel ITPR are required for both the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels and the fast ones."
3955,"Importantly, both channels are essential for normal circadian behavior. Thus, the molecular clocks may drive circadian rhythms in pacemaker neuron output by regulating different calcium sources to generate coordinated but distinct rhythms in calcium activities. CCRs are widespread across taxa."
3956,"Calcium rhythms are required for circadian pacemaker functions in both rodents and Drosophila. Studies on mammalian circadian pacemakers in the SCN are controversial regarding the temporal relationship between the CCR and rhythms in electrical activity, such as in spontaneous firing rate and in resting membrane potential. Recordings from SCN slice cultures showed that the phases of CCR in individual pacemakers are diverse and could be different from the population phase of SFR rhythms."
3957,"However, the population SFR phase is composed of many diverse phases of SFR rhythms at the individual cell level; it is unclear whether SFR phases align with the phases of CCR. Imaging with both voltage sensors and calcium sensors in SCN slices, Brancaccio et al. concluded that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase, yet Enoki et al. concluded that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase in the ventral SCN but that in the dorsal SCN, the CCR phase led the RMP rhythms by approximately 2 hours. Because the voltage sensor signal measured from the dorsal SCN may derive from the neural processes of ventral SCN neurons, the cellular interpretation of these results is unclear. Another source of inconsistency might be the culture conditions; in fact, when SCN neurons were recorded in vivo by photometry, the rhythms in fast calcium activity were in phase with slow calcium rhythms."
3958,"In general, comparisons of population rhythms and rhythms in single cells are not easily reconciled. Our recordings that tracked pacemaker neurons from different identified groups in vivo for 24 hours showed that at the single cell level, slow calcium rhythms were unambiguously in phase with rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations; the latter likely reflects rhythms in SFR. To measure the fast calcium fluctuations, we employed a high-frequency light-sheet scanning microscope termed OCPI-2."
3959,"OCPI-2 resolved limitations present in previous microscope designs that created a bottleneck in terms of the rate at which tissue volumes can be repeatedly scanned. Importantly, it does so without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Its use here was instrumental in allowing us to sample the whole-brain volume at frequencies as high as 5 Hz periodically throughout the day."
3960,"As before, we were mindful that the wavelength and amount of total incident light might activate pacemaker neurons and alter molecular clocks. We used cry01 flies to avoid the direct light responses of pacemaker neurons and found that all pacemaker groups displayed slow calcium rhythms, with patterns that were comparable to those we previously reported, except for that of l-LNv. That group displayed an additional calcium peak in the early evening and another just before lights on."
3961,"Because l-LNv innervates the optic lobes and receives large-scale visual inputs, we speculate that the repeated optical scanning might anomalously activate l-LNv in the evening via visual systems. In the later experiments, when we reduced the illumination duration per hour from 31.5 seconds to 2."
3962,"In 4s, l-LNv did not show the additional evening peaks; this was true even when measured in flies wild type for cry. Shorter durations of light exposure permit all pacemaker groups to display slow calcium rhythms with phases similar to those obtained with the slow-frequency recording sessions. Therefore, the concern to avoid technical artifacts when imaging light-sensitive pacemakers appears especially acute in the case of l-LNv."
3963,"Nevertheless, by carefully tuning the illumination intensity for calcium imaging, we propose that it is possible to monitor normal slow calcium rhythms and fast calcium fluctuations from the same individual pacemaker neurons. The causal relationships between clock gene rhythms, calcium rhythms, and electrical activity rhythms in the SCN remain generally unresolved. Treating SCN slices with Tetrodotoxin diminished SFR rhythms, partially affected RMP rhythms and CCRs, and slowly affected clock gene rhythms over several days."
3964,"Dispersed SCN cells in vitro showed a TTX-resistant CCR, suggesting that CCR is driven by clock gene rhythms. Thus, the variation in CCR sensitivity to TTX treatment might be caused by the degree to which clock gene rhythms in vitro become progressively dysfunctional. In Drosophila, our findings suggested that clock gene rhythms drive two components of the CCR—both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations—via circadian regulation of the ER channel ITPR and the membrane voltage-gated calcium channel α1T."
3965,"Both channels might then contribute to SFR and RMP rhythms. Similarly, in SCN pacemakers, pharmacologically blocking another ER channel, RyR, affected both CCR and SFR rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in basal calcium levels are regulated by calcium from the ER and are required for fast electric activity rhythms. Additionally, SCN pacemakers showed a circadian rhythm in fast calcium activity mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels."
3966,"Pharmacologically blocking these membrane channels affected SFR rhythms and, in some cases, affected CCR. In our studies, manipulating a membrane voltage-gated calcium channel in all or a subset of pacemakers selectively affected rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations, which likely reflected SFR rhythms and thus impaired circadian outputs; however, it did not significantly affect the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels. Manipulating the ER calcium channel IP3R in all pacemakers affected rhythms in both slow and fast calcium rhythms."
3967,"Therefore, in parallel to mammalian SCN neurons, Drosophila circadian pacemakers generate calcium rhythms by regulating both ER and extracellular calcium sources. Since our results suggest little or no role for the RyR channel, the daily rhythmic regulation in fly pacemakers likely acts on a different set of ER and cytoplasmic membrane channels from those in mammalian pacemakers. We also presented RNAi evidence implicating the Itpr and Ca-alpha1T genes in pacemaker cell calcium fluxes."
3968,"However, for each, only a single RNAi proved effective in reducing rhythmic power and increasing the percentage of arrhythmicity. Corroboration for our findings is provided by a prior report, which found that the same RNAi line we used decreases Itpr RNA levels. Likewise, we find corroboration in a prior report by Jeong et al., who described a specific Ca-alpha1T insertion line as a protein null mutation that exhibited reduced percentage of rhythmicity and power in DD but without a change in circadian period or in the daily per rhythm. They concluded that Ca-alpha1T expression does not affect the central clock mechanism and surmised instead that it likely affects the output of the circadian system, specifically via a requirement for the channel to permit normal physiological activation of pacemaker neurons. That work provides independent genetic confirmation of our RNAi results, and its conclusions align precisely with our own."
3969,"The RNAi knockdown experiments indicate a role for the ER calcium channel SERCA in supporting slow calcium rhythms in Drosophila pacemakers and behavioral rhythms. However, SERCA knockdown also produced high rates of lethality, and among survivors, strong effects on the PER molecular oscillation. We conclude that SERCA, which maintains the ER cytoplasmic calcium gradient, is essential for the normal physiology of the cells, but these additional phenotypes precluded an assessment of its precise role in circadian rhythmicity."
3970,"In contrast to the situation with SERCA, our results support a hypothesis that ITPR is a crucial actuator of the molecular clock. Previous transcriptomic analysis also supports that possibility; in circadian neurons, Itpr displays rhythmic expression, while SERCA does not. Knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons generally caused stronger deficits in both behavioral rhythms and calcium rhythms than in just the PDF-positive neurons."
3971,"One possibility might be that the RNAi expression level is lower when driven by pdf-GAL4 than when driven by tim-GAL4. However, knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons caused stronger deficits in the amplitude of calcium rhythms of non–PDF-positive neurons than in those of PDF-positive neurons."
3972,"Hence, a difference in the vulnerability to IP3R disruption between PDF-negative and PDF-positive neurons might provide an additional or alternative explanation for why the pdf-GAL4–driven knockdown of Itpr affected neither calcium rhythms nor behavior. We also note that the literature provides examples wherein a single RNAi line produces stronger behavioral effects when coupled with pdf-GAL4 than with tim-GAL4. Such findings suggest that the final result in such experiments will represent a mixture of GAL4 driver line strength and the differential contributions of the UAS:Responder gene product across different positions within an affected neural circuit."
3973,"Finally, the RNAi knockdown of the plasma membrane calcium channel α1T indicated a role for voltage-gated T-type calcium channels in the final rhythmic output of the pacemakers. Consistent with a role in the presumed output pathway, impairing the rhythm of fast calcium activity strongly affected circadian behavior but did not affect the molecular clock or the slow calcium rhythms. T-type channels play a crucial role in other pacemakers, such as the Sino-Atrial node of the mammalian heart."
3974,"Their conduction in the hyperpolarized state and closure at more depolarized potentials are central to their role in generating bursting dynamics with periods much longer than the membrane time constant. Given the power spectrum of the fluctuations we observed, it seems possible that α1T channels play a similar role in the fast fluctuations of Drosophila circadian neurons. Remarkably, the expression of α1T also displays a circadian rhythm, with distinct phases in different groups of pacemaker neurons."
3975,"Collectively, these results suggest that Itpr and α1T channel activity are critical to produce clock regulation of rhythms in both slow and fast calcium activities of key pacemaker neurons. Materials and Methods Fly Stocks. Flies were reared on standard yeast-supplemented cornmeal/agar food at room temperature."
3976,"After eclosion, male flies were entrained under LD cycles at 25 °C for at least 3 days. The tim > GCaMPS6s; cry01/01 flies were entrained under LD for more than 6 days. The following fly lines were previously described: tim-GAL4, pdf-GAL4, cry-LexA, UAS-GCaMP6s, and LexAop-GCaMP6s."
3977,"UAS-dSTIM and UAS-dOrai were gifts from G. Hasan, National Center for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, India. UAS-Itpr RNAi was a gift from Mark Wu, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD."
3978,"Stable lines UAS-dcr2; tim-GAL4; UAS-GCaMP6s and pdf-GAL4; UAS-dcr2; cry-LexA, LexAop-GCaMP6s were created for RNAi screening of calcium channels. The cry-LexA line was a gift from F. Rouyer, National Center for Scientific Research, Gif, Paris, France."
3979,"RNAi lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, and the Tokyo Stock Center: two lines for cac: UAS-KK101478-RNAi and UAS-JF02572-RNAi; two lines for α1T: UAS-KK100082-RNAi and UAS-JF02150-RNAi; three lines for α1D: UAS-GD1737-RNAi, UAS-JF01848-RNAi, and UAS-HMS00294-RNAi; two lines for α2δ: UAS-KK101267-RNAi and UAS-JF01825-RNAi; one line for Orai: UAS-HMC03562-RNAi; three lines for dSTIM: UAS-KK102366-RNAi, UAS-GLC01785-RNAi, and UAS-JF02567-RNAi; two lines for SERCA: UAS-KK107371-RNAi and UAS-JF01948-RNAi; and three lines for RyR: UAS-KK101716-RNAi, UAS-HM05130-RNAi, and UAS-JF03381-RNAi. In Vivo Fly Preparations and Calcium Imaging. The fly surgery followed procedures previously described."
3980,"Flies were first anesthetized by CO2 and immobilized by inserting the neck into a narrow cut in an aluminum foil base. A portion of the dorsoanterior cuticle on one side of the head, an antenna, and a small part of one compound eye were then removed. For slow calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom horizontal-scanning Objective Coupled Planar Illumination microscope."
3981,"The scanning was done by moving the stage horizontally every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Each scan contained 20 to 40 separate frames with a step size of 5 to 10 μm. For fast calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom high-speed OCPI-2 microscope."
3982,"Each scanning session involved moving the objective using a piezo motor at 1 to 5 Hz for 1 to 2 minutes. The same scans were then repeated on the same specimens every hour for 24 hours. During both slow and fast imaging modes, fresh haemolymph-like solution was continuously perfused."
3983,Locomotor Activity Rhythm. The Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor system was used to monitor the locomotor activity rhythms of individual flies; 4- to 6-day-old male flies were monitored for 6 days under LD cycles and then for 9 days under DD conditions. The circadian rhythmicity and periodicity were measured by χ² periodograms with a 95% confidence cutoff and SNR analysis.
3984,"Arrhythmicity was defined by a power value less than 10, a width lower than one, and a period less than 18 hours or more than 30 hours. Immunocytochemistry. The flies were entrained for 6 days under LD and dissected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18."
3985,"After dissection in ice-cold, calcium-free saline, fly brains were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 7% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PER [1:5,000; provided by M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA]."
3986,Secondary antisera were Cy3-conjugated. Images were taken on the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. PER protein immunostaining intensity was measured in ImageJ-based Fiji.
3987,"Imaging Data Analysis. Calcium imaging data were acquired by custom software, Imagine, and preprocessed using custom scripts in Julia 0.6 to produce non-rigid registration, alignment, and maximal projection along the z-axis."
3988,The images were then visualized and analyzed in ImageJ-based Fiji by manually selecting ROIs over individual cells or groups of cells and measuring the intensity of ROIs over time. Slow calcium activity was analyzed as described previously. Fast calcium activity in each scanning session was analyzed similarly.
3989,"Between sequential scanning sessions, the ROIs for individual neurons were manually corrected for position drifts. For the calcium signal of each ROI in each session, the mean of calcium intensity was measured. The range of calcium transients was measured by the average maximal calcium intensity at each time point and by the average minimal calcium intensity at each time point."
3990,"The power spectrum was generated by fast Fourier transform. Then, the calcium signal was filtered by a high-pass filter, and the standard deviation of calcium changes was measured. Calcium activity trace analysis and statistics were performed using R 3."
3991,"Network theory has been applied to connectomes at multiple scales to understand brain-wide organization. Such analyses quantify the interconnectivity and robustness of a network and can identify highly connected nodes that may act as hubs. They also serve as a basis for comparison across brain regions, individuals, developmental stages, or species, enabling researchers to identify commonalities and differences in brain organization. Mesoscale connectomes have been constructed for the brains of humans and other mammals from MRI and MEG data, relying on functional activity correlations to infer connectivity at the millimeter scale."
3992,"Rich-club organization has been observed in several mesoscale connectomes: in humans, other mammals, and light-level connectomes in Drosophila. Rich-club organization has been proposed to contribute to the ability of brains to efficiently integrate and disseminate information. Advancements in electron microscopy and dense volumetric reconstruction have enabled researchers to examine increasingly larger brain networks at the microscale."
3993,"These methods do not make assumptions about the relationship between neuron connectivity and functional correlations; nodes and edges can be directly related to neurons and synaptic connections. For example, rich-club neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are part of well-studied motor control circuits. Patterns of neuronal connectivity that reoccur in different brain areas, known as motifs, have been proposed as ""building blocks"" of networks, and their prevalence in neural networks has been studied to identify organizational principles."
3994,"Motifs such as reciprocal connections, feedforward loops, and 3-unicycles have received considerable attention in neuroscience owing to their implications for local computation and information flow. In this study, we characterize the network properties of the whole-brain, synapse-resolution connectome generated by the Flywire Consortium, the first complete wiring diagram of an adult brain, that of a female Drosophila melanogaster, and we lay the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical studies in this model system. A summary of data products can be found in Table 1."
3995,"Summary of the dataset and definitions: Here we analyze the v630 snapshot of the Drosophila connectome as a directed weighted graph. Synapses were detected automatically, and for each α→β neuron pair, the total number of synapses between two neurons defines the connection weight. Consistent with the flagship connectome paper, we applied a threshold of five synapses per connection, unless otherwise noted; however, we also examined the robustness of several results to variation in the synapse threshold."
3996,"This gives us a graph with 127,978 neurons and 2,613,129 connections. The connectome also contains synapse-level neurotransmitter predictions. The classifier discriminates between six neurotransmitters: the fast-acting classical neurotransmitters acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, and the monoamines dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin."
3997,"In Drosophila, acetylcholine is excitatory and GABA is inhibitory. Glutamate can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within the brain of the fly, it has largely been observed to be inhibitory. The distribution of degrees reflects the amount of connectivity between neurons."
3998,"A neuron’s in-degree is defined as the number of presynaptic partners, and the out-degree is defined as the number of postsynaptic partners. The average in/out-degree of an intrinsic neuron in the brain is 20.5, but in-degree and out-degree are not highly correlated."
3999,"The average connection consists of 12.6 synapses, and the connection probability is 0.000161."
4000,"This makes the fly brain a very sparse matrix when compared with the C. elegans nervous system or the partial wiring diagrams of larval zebrafish and mouse, with or without a threshold applied. This sparsity is due in part to the size of the fly brain."
4001,"The connection probability is highest among neurons with nearby arbors. Only 3% of neuron pairs have arbors within 50 μm of each other, but such pairs make 71% of all connections. However, even in this close regime, the connection probability in the fly is lower than in other wiring diagrams."
4002,"Neurons form one connected component. To assess interconnectivity, we searched for strongly and weakly connected components. Despite its sparsity, the brain forms a highly connected network—93.3% of neurons are contained in a single SCC, while 98.8% of neurons are contained in a single WCC. These giant connected components, which contain the majority of neurons, persist when either the strongest or weakest connections are pruned and are robust to threshold choice, indicating that connectivity is robust: many paths connect neuron pairs. Within the giant SCC, the average shortest directed path length between neuron pairs is 4.42 hops, with every neuron reachable within 13 hops. In the giant WCC, the average shortest undirected path length between neuron pairs is 3.91 hops, with every neuron reachable within 11 hops."
4003,"These numbers are comparable to those found in a similar analysis of the hemibrain dataset. The short path lengths show that the fly brain is relatively shallow compared with artificial networks. The similarities in size and path length distribution between the giant SCC and WCC highlight the prevalence of recurrent connections in the brain: in a mostly feedforward network, one would expect a smaller first SCC with longer path lengths."
4004,"To assess whether high interconnectivity is a consequence of a relatively large number of interconnected neurons, or a small number of very highly connected neurons, we constructed survival curves, observing whether large connected components persist when neurons are removed. Removing neurons from the directed network, starting with those of largest total degree, we find that the first SCC persists until a total degree of 50, at which point the network splits into two SCCs of roughly equal size. These two SCCs correspond to the left and right hemispheres, and do not split into separate networks until about 60% of neurons are removed."
4005,Removing neurons from the network by smallest total degree does not result in division of the first SCC. These results highlight the brain’s robust interconnectivity—it is not dependent on a small population of neurons. We observed similar behavior in the undirected network.
4006,"These results remain qualitatively consistent when neurons are removed by in-degree or out-degree alone. Spectral analysis of the brain. To better understand the brain’s topology, we performed a spectral analysis of a random walk in the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution over all neurons in which 3% of neurons were visited 61.2% of the time."
4007,"These top-visited neurons are classified as attractor nodes. These attractors often make connections in the gnathal ganglia, a large midline neuropil that sends and receives information from the periphery and contains many connections to the ventral nerve cord. We also performed a reverse walk within the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution in which 3% of neurons were visited 42."
4008,"4% of the time. These neurons are repeller nodes and include many with synapses in the antennal lobes and medullae, brain regions that are close to the olfactory and visual periphery, respectively. The fly brain has a large rich club. Many networks exhibit the rich-club property, in which well-connected nodes are preferentially connected to other well-connected nodes."
4009,"Comparing the observed network to a degree-preserving configuration random model, there exists a rich-club regime in the fly brain, with a cut-off of total degree = 37. This regime contains 40,218 neurons, approximately 30% of the neurons in the brain. The connection probability within the rich club is 0.000870, 5.4 times higher than the overall connection probability. The size of the rich club suggests that the network topology of the fly brain is fairly distributed, consistent with the connected component results."
4010,"A rich-club analysis considering in-degree alone finds a rich-club regime with an in-degree threshold of 10, while no rich club is observed when considering out-degree alone. Note that as we continue to remove nodes, we enter a regime where the remaining neurons are no longer preferentially connected to each other. We further consider this very high-degree regime in the discussion."
4011,"To examine the extent to which long-distance connections contribute to the rich-club property observed in the fly brain, we constructed an extension of the CFG model in which we constrain the random network by enforcing the measured connection probabilities between the 78 neuropils. By fixing the number of connections between and within neuropils, this neuropil connection model implicitly contains mesoscale spatial information. We find that the observed network is not more highly connected than the NPC model, indicating that interneuropil connections contribute to the rich-club effect."
4012,"The fraction of neurons in the rich-club regime in the fly is substantially larger than in C. elegans, which has a rich club of 11 neurons. Note that the differences in rich-club size are sensitive to the criteria used to determine the rich-club cut-off and may also be a consequence of the different scales of these two networks."
4013,"Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that while the worm rich club contains known hub neurons, such as the command neurons AVA and AVB, such highly connected hub neurons do not seem to be present in the fly brain. Although there are neurons with very high degrees, there also exist alternative paths between most neuron pairs. Recurrent motifs are over-represented. Connection reciprocity is a measure of the amount of direct feedback in the brain. Across the brain, this connection reciprocity probability is 0.138, higher than in both the Erdős–Rényi and CFG random models. The over-representation of reciprocal connections in brains is well established, and our results are consistent with previous observations in Drosophila and in other species. The clustering coefficient, a metric that assesses the prevalence of triplet structures in the network, is 0.0477 in the fly brain, higher than in both the ER and CFG models. The high clustering coefficient demonstrates that the network is highly connected and is non-random in its structure. We present these metrics alongside those for two existing whole-animal connectomes: the hermaphrodite and male C. elegans, and two subvolume wiring diagrams: the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish and a region of the L2/3 mouse visual cortex. Despite differences in the sparsity of the different brain networks, the values of reciprocity and clustering coefficient are comparable across all five datasets. The ER and CFG models do not contain any spatial information, instead assuming that any neuron pair may randomly connect."
4014,"Our NPC model contains mesoscale spatial information but does not make distance comparisons for each neuron pair. We therefore constructed a neuron-neuron distance model with two different spatial zones of connection probability, informed by the distribution of connections as a function of distance. We computed the reciprocity and clustering coefficient for both the NND and NPC models and found that the metrics for the real network were higher than in both spatial null models, suggesting that the nonrandom connectivity observed in the brain is not solely a consequence of spatial or morphological constraints."
4015,"Direct comparisons of networks of different sizes should be interpreted with caution. While the fly and worm datasets are complete brains, the zebrafish and mouse datasets are derived from brain subvolumes with truncated neurons. Moreover, differences in synapse detection and thresholding will impact topological metrics such as connection probability and reciprocity."
4016,Varying the synapse threshold in the fly did not substantially change these metrics. A small-world network is one in which nodes are highly clustered and path lengths are short. High small-worldness coefficients are associated with efficient communication between nodes.
4017,"The small-worldness coefficient of the whole-brain fly connectome is SΔ = 141, higher than that of the C. elegans connectome and close to that of the internet, implying highly effective global communication among neurons in the brain. The average strength of edges participating in reciprocal connections is higher than the average strength of unidirectional connections."
4018,"The majority of unidirectional connections are cholinergic, while the edges participating in reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic neurons and more GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory connections in the brain have more synapses on average compared with excitatory connections, which may partially explain the higher average strength of reciprocal connections. The most common reciprocal pairing is ach–GABA, and the second most common pairing is ach–glutamate."
4019,"Both of these reciprocal motifs are excitatory–inhibitory, and both are overrepresented when compared to the neurotransmitter frequencies observed for reciprocal connections. By contrast, excitatory–excitatory ach–ach pairs are underrepresented, as are inhibitory–inhibitory GABA–GABA pairs. We observed reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths to be only weakly correlated, whereas ach–ach pairs were uncorrelated."
4020,"Examples of reciprocal neuron pairs are shown in Fig. 2g. Of the 127,978 neurons in the brain, 77,607 participate in at least one reciprocal connection: approximately 2 in every 3 neurons."
4021,"Many neurons participate in multiple reciprocal connections. We define reciprocal degree as the number of reciprocal connections made by a given neuron. Plotting the distributions of reciprocal degree by neurotransmitter, we observe that the majority of neurons with a high reciprocal degree are GABAergic, while, at lower reciprocal degrees, all three primary neurotransmitter types are well represented."
4022,"For most neurons, the fraction of reciprocal connections is low—on average, 23% of incoming and 18% of outgoing connections are reciprocal. Plotting the fraction of reciprocal incoming connections against the fraction of reciprocal outgoing connections, we observed only a weak correlation, suggesting that the reciprocal degree is not strongly coupled to either in-degree or out-degree. Similarly, there is no relationship between the total degree and the reciprocal degree."
4023,"However, dividing the neuron population by neurotransmitter, we find that neurons of high total degree are mostly GABAergic, and for many of these neurons, more than half of their total connections are reciprocal. The high clustering coefficient of the brain implies an overrepresentation of triplet structures. We determined the frequency at which each of the 12 directed three-node motifs occurs in the brain."
4024,"Feedforward motifs are underrepresented when compared to both ER and CFG models, while all others, including the highly recurrent motifs, are overrepresented. The strengths of edges participating in three-node motifs are higher than the average edge strength. Complex three-node motifs that contain reciprocal connections tend to be stronger than feedforward motifs."
4025,"Examining the neurotransmitter composition of two of these motifs, feedforward loops and 3-unicycles, we found that edges that participate in feedforward loops were predominantly cholinergic, and the most common neurotransmitter composition is three cholinergic neurons, a feedforward excitatory configuration. The next most common compositions contain either one or two inhibitory edges. Feedforward loops with one inhibitory edge are probably feedforward inhibition motifs, whereas loops with two inhibitory edges are probably disinhibition motifs."
4026,"By contrast, 3-unicycles contain a higher proportion of inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and the three most common 3-unicycle compositions all contain at least one inhibitory neuron. These cycles may act as indirect feedback inhibition circuits. Notably, observed neurotransmitter composition frequencies are closer to what may be expected by chance for feedforward loops than for 3-unicycles."
4027,"Examples of neurons that form three-node motifs are shown in Fig. 3f. A high clustering coefficient and an overrepresentation of highly connected motifs suggest that the local structure of the brain displays a high degree of non-randomness, consistent with previous studies."
4028,"The overrepresentation of feedforward loops has been widely observed in other biological networks, such as in the rat cortex."
4029,"This overrepresentation is present in most neuropils in the brain. Neurons with few inputs and many outputs may function as broadcasters of signals, while those with many inputs and few outputs may act as integrators. To examine such neurons, we divided the intrinsic rich-club neurons into three categories based on their relative in-degree and out-degree, defining broadcasters as those for which out-degree ≥ 5 × in-degree and integrators as those for which in-degree ≥ 5 × out-degree."
4030,"These definitions, while arbitrary, enable us to describe neuron populations with unbalanced in-/out-degrees. Given these definitions, we find 676 broadcasters and 638 integrators. The remaining intrinsic rich-club neurons, including most highly reciprocal neurons, fall into the balanced category."
4031,"In comparison to the overall population, rich-club neurons are less likely to be cholinergic and more likely to be GABAergic. Integrators are even less likely to be cholinergic and include a large fraction of dopaminergic neurons that may be engaged during learning. By contrast, broadcasters are predominantly cholinergic."
4032,"Central brain neurons are substantially overrepresented in the rich club, while optic lobe intrinsic neurons are underrepresented. Many integrators are either central-brain-intrinsic neurons or visual projection neurons, while few broadcasters are intrinsic to the central brain—many are visual centrifugal neurons or optic lobe intrinsic neurons. Broadcasters include a large number of Mi1 and Tm3 neurons—excitatory cells in the ME known to have key roles in the motion detection circuit."
4033,"Most neurons are restricted to a single hemisphere—11% have inputs in both hemispheres and 11% have outputs in both hemispheres. Rich-club neurons are more likely to have inputs or outputs spanning both hemispheres: 18% and 17%, respectively. This is more common for integrators than for broadcasters."
4034,"Some examples of broadcasters, integrators, and balanced neurons are shown in Fig. 4d. The rich club is close to sensory inputs. To assess the distance of the rich-club neurons from sensory inputs, we used a probabilistic information flow model to determine the relative distance of each neuron from a set of seed neurons."
4035,"The model was run with different sets of seed neurons, each corresponding to a specific set of sensory inputs to the brain. This includes all sensory receptors projecting to the central brain as well as the population of visual projection neurons. Ranking these distances and normalizing returned the percentile rank of each neuron with respect to each modality."
4036,"Neurons with a percentile rank < 50% are closer than average to the given input, while neurons with a percentile rank > 50% are farther. The rich-club neurons have a mean percentile rank of 44% relative to the set of all sensory inputs. Integrators have a mean percentile rank of 43%, while broadcasters have a mean percentile rank of 53%."
4037,"The distribution of broadcasters is bifurcated, with one peak closer to inputs and another peak far from inputs. The second peak consists primarily of broadcasters in the optic lobe, which are far from sensory inputs to the central brain. Examining the ranks with respect to individual sensory modalities, we find that rich-club neurons are again closer than average to each modality."
4038,"Examining the distance of neurons to multiple sensory modalities, we find that broadcasters and integrators, while scattered throughout these distributions, tend to be closer than average to multiple sensory inputs. Integrators and broadcasters that are low in rank relative to multiple modalities may be candidate sites of multisensory integration and information propagation. Network differences across brain regions. The Drosophila connectome has been segmented into 78 neuropils, each with different average connection strengths."
4039,"To understand information flow between neuropils, we used a fractional weighting method accounting for each neuron’s projections to and from every neuropil. We computed for each neuropil the relative fraction of internal, external incoming, and external outgoing connection weights. These fractions reflect, respectively, the net number of connections within, being received, and being sent from each neuropil."
4040,"We find differences in these fractions across brain regions: the ellipsoid body and fan-shaped body of the central complex have the highest fraction of internal connections, while in other regions, such as the mushroom body, the majority of connections are external. Some regions, such as the lateral horn, send more connections than they receive, while others, such as the lobula plate, receive more connections than they send. The fraction of internal connection weights is not correlated with neuropil size: while large neuropils such as the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebra have sizable fractions of internal weights, they do not rank the highest."
4041,"Note that internal weights include any neurons with endings outside the brain, such as sensory, ascending, and descending neurons, accounting for the high fraction of internal weights in regions such as the ME, which receive inputs from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and the GNG, which connects with large numbers of ascending and descending neurons. Across the brain, 52% of all connection weights can be classified as internal. Comparing the neurotransmitters of the neurons contributing connection weights, we see that internal connections are more likely than external ones to be inhibitory."
4042,"We also see differences in the neurotransmitter composition across regions. Reciprocal connections in neuropils. To perform motif analyses within each neuropil, we identified neuropil subnetworks that treat all connections within a neuropil as edges. Different neuropils differ in connection strength and density."
4043,"Computing the reciprocity in each neuropil, we found regions with high reciprocity probabilities, including the central complex and the ALs. The relative number of reciprocal connections is high in the MB and ME. Note that, for these motif analyses, the results for small neuropils such as the cantles, bulbs, galls, accessory ME, and ocellar ganglion are less interpretable owing to the small number of neurons."
4044,"In most neuropils, as in the whole brain, reciprocal connections are stronger than unidirectional connections. Exceptions include the protocerebral bridge, MB calyces, and bulbs, which have stronger unidirectional than reciprocal connections. There are differences in the relative prevalence of each neurotransmitter in reciprocal and unidirectional connections across neuropils: while, in most neuropils, reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic and more GABAergic edges, there are notable exceptions, such as in the neuropils of the central complex."
4045,"In the MB, we find especially large differences in the neurotransmitter composition between unidirectional and reciprocal connections. Comparing the edge strengths of reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory connections within neuropil subnetworks, we observe that excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths are more strongly correlated in some neuropils than in others. These correlations do not appear to be dependent on neuropil size."
4046,"Identifying NSRNs, we searched for intrinsic highly reciprocal rich-club neurons that make the majority of their connections within a single neuropil and found 1,863 neurons that meet these criteria. These neuropil-specific highly reciprocal neurons are predominantly inhibitory: 54% are GABAergic and another 10% are glutamatergic. In some neuropils, such as the AL and EB, there are many NSRNs, while in other neuropils, there exist only a handful of such neurons."
4047,"Some NSRNs, like the APL neurons in the MB, CT1 neurons in the lobula, or AL local neurons, are known to provide global feedback inhibition in these regions. These neurons tend to be highly branched, with individual processes making reciprocal connections with different feedforward neurons. Some have been shown to have compartmentalized activity, raising the possibility of local computation."
4048,"NSRNs that have yet to be characterized may have similar roles in other circuits—for example, it is likely that NSRNs found in the AVLP provide feedback to the auditory circuits in this region. Interneuropil reciprocal connections While many reciprocal connections occur within single neuropils, 12.1% of all reciprocal pairs are formed by connections in two neuropils."
4049,"Mapping these reciprocal connections, we find off-diagonal terms that represent pairs connecting across neuropils. The compartments of the MB are linked by many reciprocal connections, while the neuropils of the suboesophageal zone, including the GNG, saddle, and prow, form a connected block. Strong reciprocal connectivity also occurs across the midline, such as between the left and right ALs."
4050,"Neuropils close to the midline, such as the superior medial protocerebrum, superior posterior slope, and inferior posterior slope, tend to have many cross-hemispheric reciprocal connections. There also exist reciprocal connections that span the central brain, such as those between the left and right anterior optic tubercles or the left and right lateral accessory lobes, demonstrating that recurrent motifs are not limited to local connections—they also exist at large spatial scales. Examples of such pairs are shown in Extended Data Fig."
4051,"We also compared the map of reciprocal connections to the projectome map of all connections. For example, the superior lateral protocerebrum and superior intermediate protocerebrum are connected to the FB in the projectome but have no reciprocal connections."
4052,"Similarly, the laminae have many internal connections but few reciprocal ones. Examining ach–GABA reciprocal connections highlights deviations from symmetry that represent a net imbalance of excitatory–inhibitory reciprocal connections. For example, between the LO and PVLP, most ach–GABA reciprocal connections share directionality: the ach connections are in the LO and the GABA connections are in the PVLP."
4053,"Three-node motifs differ across regions. We computed the prevalence of three-node motifs in each neuropil subnetwork relative to ER and CFG null models. Across most neuropils, we observed the same trend as we do across the entire brain: an under-representation of feedforward motifs and an over-representation of complex motifs. However, there are notable differences between neuropils."
4054,"In the cantles, epaulettes, and gorgets, for example, the frequency of three-node motifs was closer to that expected in a CFG null model, while in the FB and EB, complex motifs are particularly over-represented, consistent with their high reciprocity. Feedforward loops are over-represented in most neuropils, except for the FB, EB, NO, and MB compartments. This suggests a relative under-representation of both feedforward excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits in these brain regions."
4055,"3-unicycles, an indirect feedback inhibition circuit, are over-represented across the entire brain but are under-represented in most neuropils. The notable exceptions, the ME and GNG, are very large neuropils with many sensory inputs. The over-representation of 3-unicycles in the ME implies the existence of localized cyclic structures in early visual circuitry."
4056,"Notably, this motif is also over-represented in the zebrafish oculomotor circuit. Motifs 7–10 are under-represented in the ALs, perhaps a result of the small number of unidirectional edges in these regions. In most neuropils, we find that edges participating in under-represented motifs are weaker on average than edges participating in over-represented motifs, and that edges participating in three-node motifs are stronger than average."
4057,"This is broadly consistent with the whole-brain three-node motif strength results. A notable exception is the laminae, where feedforward connections are strong despite being under-represented. The completion of a wiring diagram of the full brain of D. melanogaster enabled us to characterize its network properties, laying the groundwork for connecting circuit motifs to biological function. Our analysis leverages spatial information, neuron class distinctions, cell type labels, and neurotransmitter predictions to interpret the network features we uncovered. Despite its sparsity, the fly brain is a robust and highly interconnected network, with over-represented reciprocal and recurrent motifs spanning multiple brain regions."
4058,"These long-range connections may explain results from recent brain-wide neural recording experiments in flies and other species that have uncovered widespread activity related to both sensory processing and behavior. We provide searchable and filterable lists of the neurons discussed in this study, as well as a motif search and visualization tool to facilitate hypothesis generation and model development online through Codex. The availability of neurotransmitter predictions for at least ach, GABA, glut, da, ser, and oct greatly enhanced our ability to interpret the circuit motifs we identified in the connectome."
4059,"However, although neurotransmitter predictions are 94% accurate when compared to a set of ground truth neurons, there are cases in which the predicted neurotransmitter does not align with the known transmitter. Here, we manually corrected the Kenyon cells to be cholinergic. There may exist other populations that are also systematically misidentified, but which currently lack ground truth neurotransmitter information."
4060,"While we assume that neurons obey Dale’s law, there are several known examples of co-transmission in Drosophila. It remains unclear how widespread neurotransmitter co-transmission is. Note also that the synaptic connectome does not provide a complete picture of information flow in the brain. We do not currently have a map of gap junction synapses in the fly or of the extent of neuropeptide signaling. Some analyses, particularly those dependent on network topology, are sensitive to our choice of synapse threshold. While connectomes in C. elegans have been proofread to the level of individual synapses, this is not feasible in larger datasets. We therefore rely on automated synapse detection algorithms with a non-negligible error rate. Not all synapses are successfully attached to neurons, and this completion rate varies across brain regions."
4061,"Although some of these low-synapse-number connections may be spurious, it is likely that some weak connections persist across individuals, as has been found in C. elegans. Our companion paper on the fly optic lobe has found that a lower synapse threshold is important for correct cell type identification in those brain regions, further suggesting the importance of some low-synapse connections."
4062,"Here we applied a consistent and conservative threshold of five synapses per connection between neurons, and we demonstrated that our interpretations of connected components, sparsity, reciprocity, and clustering coefficients are not dependent on this threshold. It is likely that the fly brain is more strongly interconnected than the results here indicate. Local circuit motifs are often inferred to be feedforward or feedback connections."
4063,"However, it is difficult to place local circuits in the context of global directionality from sensory input to motor output. In shallow networks, the directionality of the wiring diagram is clear. However, the larger the network becomes, the more difficult it becomes to establish directionality."
4064,"In this study, we used an information flow method to rank neurons relative to various sensory modalities. Ultimately, the directionality of information flow in particular circuits, especially those in regions of the brain far from sensory inputs or motor outputs, must be determined experimentally. Different neuropils in Drosophila are known to have different functions."
4065,"Studying network topology at the brain scale enables us to highlight how these functional differences are supported by network differences. For example, the MBs are known to be a center for learning and memory in the fly brain. We find in the MB compartments the largest fraction of dopaminergic connections, the biggest differences between reciprocal and unidirectional neurotransmitter percentages, and a three-node motif distribution close to that of null models."
4066,"This combination of network characteristics is unique across the neuropils of the brain. Another well-studied neuropil, the EB, is known to be involved in navigation, supporting persistent activity correlated to heading direction. We observed that the EB has one of the highest reciprocity rates, one of the highest average connection strengths, and very large over-representations of highly recurrent three-node motifs."
4067,"This represents a unique combination of neuropil-scale network properties. By contrast, while the GNG has a similar three-node motif profile, it has much lower connectivity. The anatomy of the fly brain suggests two potential bottlenecks: one between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere and one between the central brain and optic lobes. Only 12% of neurons cross hemispheres and 6% of neurons cross between the central brain and optic lobes."
4068,"Despite these bottlenecks, the brain is still robustly interconnected with short path lengths. The large rich-club regime in the fly brain may explain these short path lengths. When compared to the average neuron in the brain, rich-club neurons are more likely to contain synapses in both hemispheres and are also more likely to connect the optic lobes to the central brain."
4069,"The broad spatial reach of these rich-club neurons also keeps path lengths short across these bottlenecks. In the human brain, it has been proposed that rich-club hubs in functional connectomes help keep path lengths short. In the fly brain, we see that the rich-club neuron population indeed contributes to short path lengths."
4070,"Future functional experiments in the fly focusing on the rich-club population may shed light on whether this is the case at the neuron scale. We also expect that the ascending and descending neurons, which form a bottleneck between the brain and the VNC, will be part of the central nervous system rich club. Many ascending and descending neurons appear to have high degrees when examined within either the brain or the VNC."
4071,"We await the completion of a complete CNS connectome to verify the rich-club membership of such neurons. Our rich-club analysis showed that we enter a rich-club regime above a total degree of 37. However, as we continue to remove neurons, we find that the population of neurons above degree ~100 is no longer preferentially connected relative to either CFG or NPC random networks."
4072,"On the basis of the SCC and WCC survival curves, these very-high-degree neurons do not form multiple islands of connectivity. Rather, the first connected component persists until nearly all neurons are removed, and the second connected component never approaches the size of the first. The under-representation of connections between the very highest degree neurons is correlated with neurotransmitter composition—most are GABAergic."
4073,"These very large GABAergic neurons are less likely than chance to form connections with each other. Comparing network properties across different species has the potential to uncover conserved and divergent properties of brain organization. Similarities in reciprocity and clustering coefficient across animals, which vary substantially in both size and connection density, hint at the possibility that some features of circuit architecture may be broadly conserved across nervous systems."
4074,"However, comparisons of graph metrics across networks of different sizes, even for neuron-normalized metrics such as reciprocity and clustering coefficient, must be made with care. Moreover, as mentioned previously, differences in proofreading and thresholding will impact topological metrics, which treat all edges as equivalent. Applying the same threshold across datasets does not resolve this, as a given number of synapses may have different biological implications across species."
4075,"It has also been observed, both in this work and in past studies, that different parts of the brain of the fly differ in their connectivity properties. It is likely that the same is true in larger brains, meaning that statistics derived from partial wiring diagrams may not be representative. In C. elegans, there is substantial variability in the connectomes of genetically identical individuals. Comparisons between the FlyWire and hemibrain datasets have already revealed similarities and differences between individual flies, but more datasets will be needed before we fully understand the variability between individuals in Drosophila. Fortunately, more whole-brain connectomes are on the horizon."
4076,"The network analysis of the fly brain presented should serve as a valuable baseline for comparison, both to the connectomes of other Drosophila individuals and to the connectomes of other species, to identify which network features are common and which are species- or individual-specific. A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ""parts list"" of the brain and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision."
4077,"Here we analyze the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families at least double in the number of types."
4078,A new serpentine medulla interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analyzing the distances in high-dimensional feature space and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features.
4079,"We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object, and color vision. Connectivity with ""boundary types"" that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity, and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development."
4080,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the twentieth century concern the neural basis of sensory perception. Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery of simple and complex cells in the visual cortex not only entered neuroscience textbooks, but the hypothetical neuronal wiring diagrams in their 1962 paper also inspired convolutional nets, which eventually ignited the deep-learning revolution in artificial intelligence. It may come as a surprise that directly mapping such wiring diagrams, influential as they may be, has been highly challenging or even impossible in mammalian brains."
4081,"Progress is being made by visual physiologists, and the reconstruction of a column of visual cortex from electron microscopy images is also becoming feasible. These are tiny slivers of visual systems; scaling up to the full complexity of mammalian vision is still aspirational. To imagine the future of visual neuroscience, it is helpful to extrapolate from a brain of a more modest size—that of the fly."
4082,"Especially over the past 15 years, visual neural circuits have been intensively investigated in Drosophila with great progress in understanding the perception of motion, color, and objects, as well as the role of vision in complex behaviors like courtship. The release of a neuronal wiring diagram of a Drosophila brain poses an unprecedented opportunity. The first wiring diagram for a whole brain contains as a corollary the first wiring diagram for an entire visual system, as well as all the wiring connecting the visual system with the rest of the brain."
4083,"About 38,500 neurons are intrinsic to the right optic lobe of the reconstructed Drosophila brain. The full wiring diagram for these neurons is too complex to comprehend or even visualize. It is essential to reduce complexity by describing the connectivity between types of cells."
4084,"For example, the roughly 800 ommatidia in the compound eye send photoreceptor axons to roughly 800 L1 cells in the lamina, which in turn connect with around 800 Mi1 cells. That is a lot of cells and connections, but they can all be described by the simple rules that photoreceptors connect to L1, and L1 connects to Mi1. Some such rules are known, but this knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete."
4085,"Here we exhaustively enumerate all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe and find all rules of connection between them. We effectively collapse 38,500 intrinsic neurons onto just 227 types, a reduction of more than 150 times. The wiring diagram is reduced from a 38,500 × 38,500 matrix to a 227 × 227 matrix, an even greater compression."
4086,"We additionally provide rules of connectivity between intrinsic types and 500 types of boundary neurons, which have also been annotated. In our connectomic approach, a cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar patterns of connectivity, and such cells are expected to share the same function. By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions."
4087,"This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking. Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe, and are the main topic of this study. Moreover, there are boundary neurons that straddle the optic lobe and the rest of the brain."
4088,"Boundary neurons fall into several classes: visual projection neurons project from the optic lobe to the central brain, visual centrifugal neurons do the opposite, and heterolateral neurons extend from one optic lobe to the other while making few or no synapses in the central brain. Targets of boundary neurons in the central brain are generally multimodal and/or sensorimotor, mixing information coming from the eyes and other sense organs, so we regard the optic lobe proper as the fly’s visual system. The brain of a single Drosophila adult female was reconstructed by the FlyWire Consortium."
4089,"We proofread around 38,500 intrinsic neurons in the right optic lobe, as well as 3,900 visual projection neurons, 250 visual centrifugal neurons, 150 heterolateral neurons, and 4,700 photoreceptor cells. In total, 77% of the synapses of intrinsic neurons are with other intrinsic neurons, and 23% are with boundary neurons. We divide optic lobe intrinsic neurons into four broad classes: columnar, local interneuron, cross-neuropil tangential, and cross-neuropil amacrine."
4090,"Cells of the columnar class have axons oriented parallel to the main axis of the visual columns. Following a previous study, the arbor of a columnar neuron is allowed to be wider than a single column; what matters is the orientation of the axon, not the aspect ratio of the arbor. Photoreceptor cells are columnar but are not intrinsic to the optic lobe, strictly speaking, because they enter from the retina."
4091,"Nevertheless, they will sometimes be included with intrinsic types in the following analyses. The optic lobe contains four main neuropils and a smaller fifth neuropil—the accessory medulla. We further distinguish between distal and proximal medulla, regarding them as two separate neuropils."
4092,"The border between them is layer 7 of the medulla, which is also known as the serpentine layer. A columnar cell spans multiple neuropils. Cells of the local interneuron class are defined as being confined to a single neuropil."
4093,We also define two classes that cross multiple neuropils but are not columnar. A cross-neuropil tangential cell has an axon that is oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the visual columns as it runs inside a neuropil. A cross-neuropil amacrine cell lacks an axon.
4094,Interneurons are typically amacrine but sometimes have an axon in the tangential orientation. Each class is divided into families. A family is defined as a set of cells that share the same neuropils.
4095,"For example, the Tm family projects from the distal medulla to the lobula, while the TmY family projects from the distal medulla to both the lobula and lobula plate. Each family is divided into cell types. All 227 intrinsic types, as well as photoreceptor types, are available for 3D interactive viewing."
4096,"Supplementary Data 1 includes a list of all intrinsic types and their properties. Supplementary Data 2 contains one “card” for each type, which includes its discriminative logical predicate, basic statistics, a diagram showing stratification and other single-cell anatomy, and 3D renderings of all the cells in the type. Most neurons in the optic lobe are columnar, and half of the families are columnar."
4097,"Interneurons constitute just 17% of optic lobe intrinsic neurons, but the majority of cell types. A columnar family contains more cells than any other family. An interneuron family contains more types than any other family."
4098,"The columnar families are well known. The Sm interneuron family is new, and its name is inspired by its stratification in the serpentine medulla. Some of the cross-neuropil families are wholly or almost wholly new."
4099,"Over half of the cell types are new, and many of these are interneuron types. For each cell, we define an output feature vector by the number of output synapses onto neurons of cell type t, which runs from 1 to T. The output feature vector is a row of the cell-to-type connectivity matrix."
4100,"For each cell, we similarly define an input feature vector based on the number of input synapses received from neurons of cell type t. This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix. The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector."
4101,"The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227. A cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar feature vectors. Cells of the same type are near each other in feature space, while cells of different types are far away."
4102,This was quantified using the weighted Jaccard distance. Our definition of feature vectors requires that some cell types should already exist. An initial set of cell types was defined by human analysts using traditional morphological criteria.
4103,"These traditional cell types were used to compute feature vectors, and hierarchical clustering was applied. In many cases, this led to further division into cell types that could not be distinguished by traditional criteria. In other cases, it led to the grouping of morphological variants into a single type."
4104,"After splitting or merging types, the feature vectors were recomputed, and the process was continued iteratively. The final cell types were validated in several ways. We show that our clustering is self-consistent, in the sense that almost all cells end up in the original cluster if we attempt to reassign each cell’s feature vector to the nearest cluster."
4105,"For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership. We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of, on average, five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil."
4106,"Hierarchical clustering of cell types: We defined a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity. It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections.” The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions."
4107,"A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization. Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
4108,"By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions. This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking."

A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization."
4129,"Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types. Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering, which will be interpreted later on."
4130,"One that we have found to be helpful is to display the top input and output connections of each type. In such a graph, some nodes can have more than one outgoing and/or more than one incoming connection. A few of these nodes appear as ‘hubs’ with many visible connections."
4131,"For example, Mi1 is the top input to a large number of postsynaptic types. The nodes of the graph were positioned in 2D space by a graph layout algorithm that tends to place strongly connected types close together. It turns out that nearby nodes in the 2D graph layout space tend to belong to the clusters extracted from the high-dimensional connectivity-based feature vectors."
4132,"We can also normalize the type-to-type connection matrix to be the fraction of synapses from cell type s to cell type t. Depending on the normalization, this could be the fraction of input to type t or the fraction of output from type s. Input and output fractions are shown in Supplementary Data 5 and are equivalent to the cell type feature vectors defined earlier."
4133,"The heat maps of Supplementary Data 5 are important because they show a much more complete set of connections than the wiring diagrams, which are highly selective visualizations. The degree of a cell type can be defined as the number of cell types to which it is connected. Weak connections can be excluded from this definition by thresholding the type-to-type connection matrix before computing degree."
4134,"For a threshold-independent measure, we instead calculate a ‘perplexity’ for each cell type. The outgoing connection strengths are normalized as if they were a probability distribution, and out-perplexity is defined as the exponential of the entropy of this distribution. Out-perplexity reduces to out-degree in the special case that the distribution is uniform over the connected partners."
4135,"In-perplexity is defined analogously. If intrinsic cell types are ranked by the product of out- and in-perplexity, then TmY5a is the most connected hub, and various types in the lamina and distal medulla are the least hub-like. Motion-related cell types generally do not have high perplexity."
4136,"Out-perplexity tends to be greater than in-perplexity, although they are positively correlated. One might expect that ‘early’ types in visual processing would have divergent connectivity, to distribute photoreceptor signals to many targets, while ‘late’ types would have convergent connectivity, summarizing the final results of optic lobe computations for use by the central brain. This idea can be tested by ranking types according to the ratio of out-perplexity to in-perplexity."
4137,"Indeed, the top of the list includes early types like the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, L3 and L5, and many Dm and Pm interneuron types, while many Sm types are near the bottom of the list; they can be interpreted as ‘late’ types given their extensive connectivity with VPNs. The ‘numerous’ cell types are photoreceptor axons projecting retinotopically from the eye to the lamina and distal medulla. The medulla is divided into columns, which are presumed to be in one-to-one correspondence with the ommatidia of the compound eye."
4138,"Cell types containing more than 720 cells in our reconstruction, as well as photoreceptor types, will be called ‘numerous’. The top end of this range is likely the true number of columns in this optic lobe. For each numerous type, the cells appear to be distributed one per column, and the true number of cells is expected to approximate 800."
4139,"The observed cell numbers are mostly smaller than 800; some cells are missing from columns, presumably due to the under-recovery of cells by proofreading. The connections between numerous types agree well with a previous reconstruction of seven medulla columns. The 28 numerous types have long been known."
4140,"At the other extreme, 16 types contain only a single cell. Most types lie between the extremes. It is the less numerous types of which our knowledge has been incomplete, and arguably they are where much of the magic of vision happens."
4141,"As with the photoreceptors, neural activity in the numerous cell types like L1 and Mi1 mostly encodes information about the image at or near single points in visual space. However, perception requires the integration of information from points that can be quite distant from each other, and this is done by the larger neurons that belong to the less numerous types. For most of the numerous types, visual responses have been observed previously, and will be used to interpret the dendrogram of Fig. 2c. We will see that the numerous types that belong to a single cluster have similar functions, which enables us to ascribe a function to each cluster as a whole. In other words, we extrapolate from the functions of the numerous types to yield preliminary clues regarding the functions of the less numerous types."
4142,"These extrapolations are speculative and are merely starting points for hypothesis generation and experimental research, and the clusters are not set in stone. They were obtained by thresholding a hierarchical clustering, and adjusting this threshold will change the number of clusters. Rather than use our clusterings, some readers may prefer to directly consult the weighted Jaccard distances between types, from which the clusterings were derived."
4143,"Other cautionary notes about the clusters are given in the Methods and Discussion. These caveats notwithstanding, we next proceed to the functional interpretation of the clusters in Fig. 2c."
4144,"Cluster 10 and Cluster 11 both receive strong input from photoreceptors R1–6, and we propose that they are regarded as OFF and ON channels, respectively, carrying information about light decrements and light increments. Our concept is similar to the well-known ON and OFF motion pathways, but differs because our ON and OFF channels are general purpose, feeding into the object and color subsystems as well as the motion subsystem. Cluster 10 contains the OFF cells L2, L4, Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4."
4145,"Cluster 11 contains the ON cells L5, Mi1, and Tm3, and also the OFF cell L1. It makes sense to assign L1 to the ON channel even though it is an OFF cell because L1 is inhibitory/glutamatergic, so its effects on downstream partners are similar to those of an ON excitatory cell. Note that information about whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory was not used by our clustering algorithm."
4146,"Cluster 11 also contains C2 and C3, which are expected to be ON cells because their top inputs are L1 and L5. A companion paper argues that the various Dm interneuron types in Cluster 10 and Cluster 11 normalize the activities of numerous types in the OFF and ON channels. The ON and OFF motion pathways were traditionally defined by working backwards from the T4 and T5 motion detectors, which respectively compute the directions of moving ON and OFF stimuli."
4147,"The ON motion pathway is directly upstream from T4 and includes Mi1, Mi4, Mi9, and Tm3. The OFF motion pathway is directly upstream from T5 and includes Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9. Figure 4 shows that these cell types have other strong targets besides T4/T5, so they do not seem to be solely or chiefly dedicated to motion."
4148,"L3 connectivity is sufficiently unique that it stands apart from all of the other cell types as a cluster containing only the single type L3. This is consistent with current thinking that L3 constitutes a separate luminance channel, distinct from ON and OFF channels. L3 is the only L type with a sustained rather than transient response, and it encodes luminance rather than contrast."
4149,"Cluster 7 includes Dm4, Dm9, Dm12, Dm20, and Mi9, which all have L3 as their strongest input. Mi9 is also the strongest output of L3 and, like L3, exhibits a sustained response. We therefore propose that cluster 7 should be lumped with L3 in a hypothetical luminance channel."
4150,"Mi9 is traditionally grouped in the ON motion pathway, but Mi9 is an input to the object and colour subsystems, not only the motion subsystem. It is less obvious whether the remaining types in cluster 7 should be grouped in the luminance channel. Indeed, these types break off into separate clusters when the threshold is adjusted to refine the flat clustering."
4151,"These types might alternatively be assigned to the colour subsystem as Mi15 and Dm2 are known to receive direct input from inner photoreceptor R8. Lawf2 is a cluster of its own. By targeting cell types in cluster 11, Lawf2 provides centrifugal feedback to the ON channel."
4152,"However, the strongest output of Lawf2 is Lai, which is thought to mediate lateral inhibition in the lamina through pathways such as R1–6→Lai→R1–6 and R1–6→Lai→L3. Lawf2 may therefore modulate lateral interactions mediated by Lai. The strongest input to Lawf2 is OA-AL2b2, which could be octopaminergic or cholinergic."
4153,"If it is octopaminergic, this input could be the source of the previously reported octopaminergic gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons. Lawf2 also receives strong input from cluster 9, which is hypothesized to be an object subsystem later on. Lai and Lawf1, the two types in cluster 8, have similar targets."
4154,"Cluster 8 provides centrifugal feedback to the OFF channel and to R1–6. Alternatively, cluster 8 could be interpreted as being part of the luminance channel, as cluster 7 is a strong input and L3 a strong output. Motion The motion-detecting T4 and T5 families belong to cluster 15."
4155,"Cluster 16 contains CT1 and Tm9, which are well known to be important for motion computation. It makes sense to regard Tm9 as dedicated to the motion subsystem rather than part of a general-purpose OFF channel, as 80% of its output synapses are onto CT1 or T5. Cluster 16 also includes Li14, an interneuron type with T5a as the strongest input, and T5a through T5d as the strongest outputs."
4156,"T4/T5 neurons synapse onto VPNs that exit the optic lobe and enter the central brain. Cluster 13 and cluster 14 contain the lobula plate interneuron family, LPi1 through LPi1. Over half of these are new."
4157,"Some LPi types consist of one or two cells that cover the entire visual field. Two LPi types may stratify in the same lobula plate layers but consist of cells with different sizes. Most LPi types are amacrine, but some exhibit axo-dendritic polarization."
4158,"Some types collectively cover only a portion of the visual field. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 types, so it is clear that cluster 13 and cluster 14 are related to motion vision. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 cells with a single preferred direction."
4159,"The only exception is LPi07, which receives inputs from T4/T5 cells with preferred directions c and d. LPi types synapse onto other LPi types and onto VPNs. Cluster 13 also contains columnar neurons from three Y types and all Tlp types."
4160,"All of these are predicted to be glutamatergic and are reciprocally connected with T4/T5 of particular preferred directions. The only exception is Tlp5, which receives input only from T4a/T5a. The Y and Tlp types also connect with LPi and columnar VPN types."
4161,"TmY20 and Am1 also belong to cluster 13 and were previously identified to be motion related. Cluster 9 includes the numerous types T2 and T3, which have been implicated in the detection of small objects. Their downstream VPN partners LC11 and LC18 are also activated by small objects."
4162,"On the basis of this information, we propose that cluster 9 is part of a hypothetical object subsystem. Cluster 9 includes many other types from columnar families, interneuron families, and cross-neuropil tangential and amacrine families. Downstream targets include LC, LPLC, and LT types."
4163,"Mi1 and Tm1 are the most prominent inputs to the subsystem and respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels defined above. They are top inputs to T3, explaining why T3 is ON–OFF. T2 is ON–OFF because its top inputs are L5 and Tm2, which respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels."
4164,"Note that the Tm1 input to T2 and the L5 input to T2 are second from the top and therefore do not show up in the figure, which is restricted to the top inputs and outputs. Several types are nearby T2 and T3 in the cell types dendrogram."
4165,"In particular, T2a, Tm21, Tm25, Tm27, TmY3, and Y3 are fairly numerous and excitatory, so we regard them as candidate object detectors. Despite its name, T2a is more similar to T3 in connectivity than to T2. T2a also receives Mi1 and Tm1 input like T3 and is predicted to be ON–OFF."
4166,"The top output of T2a is LC17, which is known to be activated by small objects and also receives input from T3. Cluster 12 contains Li19 and Li25. Cluster 9 is both a strong input to cluster 12 and a strong output of cluster 12, largely due to connections between Tm21 and Cluster 12."
4167,"We therefore include cluster 12 as well as cluster 9 in the object subsystem. Colour and polarization: The inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 are important for Drosophila colour vision because their responses are more narrowly tuned to the wavelength of light than those of the outer photoreceptors R1–6. R7 prefers ultraviolet light, whereas R8 prefers blue or green light."
4168,"Cluster 4 contains Dm8a, Dm8b, Dm11, and DmDRA2, which are all inner photoreceptor targets. Cluster 1 contains most of the remaining types so far implicated in colour vision. As originally defined by morphology, Tm5 is a potential postsynaptic target of the inner photoreceptors because it stratifies in the distal medulla at the M7 border and also in the M3."
4169,These are the medulla layers containing the axon terminals of R7 and R8. We found that Tm5 consists of six cell types. Three of our connectomic Tm5 types correspond to canonical Tm5 types that were previously defined by morphology and Ort expression.
4170,"Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 input, while Tm5c receives R8 input. Moreover, we found three new types, Tm5d, Tm5e, and Tm5f, that receive little or no photoreceptor input, although their stratifications are similar to those of the canonical Tm5 types. The correspondences between connectomic and morphological-molecular Tm5 types were established using morphological criteria."
4171,"However, the reader should be cautioned that there is considerable variability within a type, so reliably typing individual cells based on morphology alone is difficult or impossible. Connectivity is essential for reliable discriminations. Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 and Dm8 input, as expected from previous reports."
4172,"Tm5c receives R8 input and also strong L3 input. While some synapses from Dm8 to Tm5c do exist, this connection seems to be weak. Tm20 has been implicated in color vision because it receives R8 input."
4173,"It also receives strong L3 input. Thus, Tm20 inputs are similar to Tm5c inputs, consistent with the physiological finding that these two types are more similar to each other in their chromatic responses than they are to Tm5a and Tm5b. As Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c, and Tm20 are known to be related to color vision, we propose that the rest of cluster 1 is also part of a hypothetical color subsystem."
4174,"The new Tm5 types receive few or no synapses directly from photoreceptors, but Tm5d receives indirect R7 input from Tm5b and Dm8a, Tm5e receives indirect R8 input from Tm5c, and Tm5f receives indirect R8 input from Tm20. Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic. We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective."
4175,"As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative. Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a, and Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37."
4176,"The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla. Nevertheless, we decided to lump them into the Tm family."
4177,"Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic. Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic."
4178,"Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm, and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10. Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs."
4179,"Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem. This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem."
4180,"Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. Tm20, Tm5d, and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic, and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic."
4181,"We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively, and this preference is highly selective. As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies remains speculative."
4182,"Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a, Tm8b, Tm16, and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37. The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula. These types mainly stratify in the serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in the distal medulla."
4183,"Nevertheless, we decided to group them into the Tm family. Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few cells and are predicted not to be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous and predicted to be cholinergic."
4184,"Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each and are predicted to be cholinergic. Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm and Pm interneuron types, MLt types, and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10."
4185,"Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs. Mi4 has strong partners in the color and object subsystems. Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the color subsystem."
4186,"This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem. Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4 in Tlp4."
4187,"In the first stage of morphology-based classification, these errant cells were assigned to Y11. But such pseudo-Y11 cells were later reassigned to Tlp4 on the basis of connectivity. Their feature vectors match Tlp4 because their medullary projections make few synapses, and their connectivity in the lobula and lobula plate matches Tlp4."
4188,"It is worth mentioning an unusual example in which ignoring morphological variation is correct in one sense but ultimately turns out to be misleading. Three Li11 cells are annotated in the hemibrain reconstruction, and three corresponding cells can be identified in our optic lobe. We group two of these cells into one type."
4189,"The third cell can be paired with a fourth to form a pseudo-Li11 type with a small axonal projection into the central brain. Although the axon is visually striking, it has few synapses and therefore little impact on connectivity. Thus, it might be tempting to ignore the axon as a developmental ""accident"" and merge Li11 and pseudo-Li11 into a single type."
4190,"But it turns out that Li11 and pseudo-Li11 are distinct types, owing to their different connectivity in the lobula. For example, Li25 has strong LT61 output, while pseudo-Li11 has strong LT11 input. Pseudo-Li11 also exists in the hemibrain, although there it lacks the small projection."
4191,"So the central brain projection of pseudo-Li11 exhibits variability across individuals, further evidence that it is a developmental accident. We introduce the new names Li25 and Li19 to replace Li11 and pseudo-Li11. A few cells were dismissed as developmental accidents. This could be done with high confidence when the cells were small and few in number."
4192,"However, we had difficulty deciding about Li29 because it was a full-field cell in the lobula, but it also extended a smaller secondary arbor into the lobula plate. Originally, we decided that this cell was a developmental accident and did not include it in our list of types. Later, we found that this odd-looking cell is repeated in the left optic lobe and promoted it to a type."
4193,"Spatial coverage: All cell-typing efforts must decide whether to split types more finely or merge types more coarsely. We resolved this lumper-splitter dilemma by using spatial coverage as a criterion. As a general rule, the cells of a cell type collectively cover all columns of the optic lobe with a density that is fairly uniform across the visual field."
4194,"This makes sense for implementing translation-invariant computations, a strategy that is commonly used in convolutional networks and other computer vision algorithms. Uniform spatial coverage is sometimes called ""tiling,"" although cell type arbors often overlap so much that the analogy to floor tiles can be misleading. Spatial coverage is also a property of many cell types in the mammalian retina."
4195,"In some types consisting of just one or a few cells, we identified an unconventional jigsaw-style spatial coverage. For example, LPi14, also known as LPi1-210, is a pair of full-field cells. We refer to them as a jigsaw pair because they jointly cover the visual field in an irregular manner, as if they were cut by a jigsaw."
4196,"Jigsaw types can also be found in other interneuron families and include Pm14, Li27, and Li28. Our feature vector includes no explicit information about the spatial coordinates of a cell. Thus, if clustering feature vectors results in cell types with good spatial coverage, that is an independent validation of the clustering."
4197,"Coverage also solves the lumper-splitter dilemma. Suppose that we attempt to split one type into two candidate types based on hierarchical clustering. If both candidate types exhibit good coverage, then we accept them as valid."
4198,"If the cells of both candidate types seem randomly scattered, that means our split is invalid because it is presumably discriminating between cells based on noise. Chromatic types like Tm5 and Dm8 might seem to be an exception to this rule, but their apparently random locations may turn out to depend systematically on pale and yellow columns. The above are easy cases, but there are also edge cases."
4199,"Suppose that splitting results in two candidate types that neatly cover the dorsal field and the ventral field, respectively, without overlap. We then reject the split, preferring to lump the two candidate types into a single type that exhibits dorsoventral spatial variation in connectivity. On the other hand, if one candidate type covers the dorsal field and the other covers the full field, this is an acceptable split."
4200,"With these heuristics, some of our cell types end up with only partial coverage of the visual field. This is especially common for boundary types. Sm is the intrinsic type family containing the most types with partial coverage."
4201,"This makes sense, given that Sm cells interact closely with many boundary types arborizing in the serpentine layer. Cell types with partial coverage make sense in the later stages of vision. After the early stages of vision, computer vision also often discards translation invariance and may perform different visual computations in different regions of the visual field."
4202,"Discussion: The connectomic approach to cell typing has three advantages. First, it is not subject to the incomplete and biased sampling that can affect other methods. Second, connectivity provides a rich set of features for distinguishing between cell types."
4203,"Third, connectomic cell typing not only yields cell types but also, importantly, tells us how they are wired to each other. Implications for visual function: We clustered cell types with similar connectivity patterns and proposed tentative interpretations of the clusters in terms of visual functions. These interpretations are speculations but should be useful for generating hypotheses that suggest interesting experiments."
4204,"Our hypothetical subsystems are devoted to motion, object, and colour vision and are fed by ON, OFF, and luminance channels. The motion subsystem contains not only the T4 and T5 families but also many interneuron types. Most interneuron types belong to the LPi family, which has been proposed to mediate opponent interactions between cells that are activated by different directions of motion."
4205,"Such opponency was demonstrated between LPi09 and LPi11, also known as LPi3-4 and LPi4-3. It is likely that LPi types can also mediate spatial normalization, as described in a companion paper. Of the 51 types in the hypothetical object subsystem, T2 and T3 have been characterized by physiologists as object detectors."
4206,"Above, we hypothesized that a number of other types are object detectors, and these candidates can be tested by future experiments. The hypothetical colour subsystem contains 91 types. One can only speculate about the reason for this numeric preponderance."
4207,"Some insects are known to have sophisticated colour vision capabilities, such as colour constancy. The computations required for colour constancy are quite complex, requiring the integration of image information over long ranges. This could potentially be implemented by the large number of Sm and Li interneuron types in the hypothetical colour subsystem, assuming that Drosophila turns out to exhibit colour constancy."
4208,"Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 1 and cluster 3 have additional functions other than colour vision and should be subdivided more finely. Future experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. A companion paper predicts that the six types in cluster 2 should exhibit orientation selectivity and hypothesizes that cluster 2 is a subsystem for form vision."
4209,"Cluster 2 connects to Cluster 1, suggesting an interaction between form and color computations. Although we have divided the optic lobe into distinct subsystems, we are aware that it is simplistic to assign every cell type to just one functional subsystem. This is the result of the ""hard"" clustering algorithm that we have used, which always assigns a cell type to a single cluster."
4210,"In reality, a cell type could have more than one function, or a cell type might mediate interactions between more than one subsystem. The wiring diagrams show many connections between cell types in different subsystems. Assigning such a cell type to a single subsystem is inherently ambiguous."
4211,"Implications for visual development: The detailed wiring diagram for an adult visual system precisely specifies the end goal of visual system development. Single-cell transcriptomics is providing detailed information about the molecules in fly visual neurons. Comparison of transcriptomic and connectomic information is already uncovering molecules that are important for the development of the fly visual system, and this trend is likely to increase in momentum."
4212,"Such research could be aided by our low-dimensional discriminators of cell types. Complete and unbiased early studies relied on Golgi staining to sample neurons from multiple individuals, a technique that is best suited for identifying the most numerous types. Most of our new types are not as numerous, which may be why they were missed."
4213,"Furthermore, Golgi studies may have mistaken morphological variants for types, which could explain why many of their types cannot be identified in our optic lobe. Contemporary light-microscopy anatomy leverages genetic lines, but still does not evade the limitations of incomplete and biased sampling. The story of Tm5 serves as a case in point."
4214,"A breakthrough in color vision started by genetically labeling neurons that express the histamine receptor Ort. Researchers reasoned that Ort would be expressed by cells postsynaptic to the chromatic photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are histaminergic. Then, light-microscopy anatomy was used to make fine distinctions between three Tm5 types labeled in the transgenic line."
4215,"The present connectomic work has revealed six Tm5 types, a finding that was only foreshadowed by previous work on the same EM dataset. The three new Tm5 types were presumably missed by previous studies because they receive little or no direct photoreceptor input and do not express Ort. Nevertheless, they are similar to the old Tm5 types in morphology and connectivity, and have been grouped in the hypothetical color subsystem."
4216,"The Tm5 example demonstrates that connectomics can find fresh patches in well-trodden ground. More importantly, connectomics can guide us to entirely new landscapes, such as the 43 Sm types in an entirely new type family. Distinguishing cell types using connectivity features based on connectivity enabled us to discriminate between cell types that stratify in very similar neuropil layers."
4217,"Stratification constrains connectivity because neurons cannot connect with each other unless they overlap in the same layers. However, stratification does not completely determine connectivity, because neurons in the same layer may or may not connect with each other. Classical neuroanatomy, whether based on Golgi or genetic staining, relied on stratification because it could be seen with a light microscope."
4218,"Now that we have electron microscopy data, we can rely on connectivity for cell typing rather than settle for stratification as a proxy. That being said, the present study used only connectivity at the final stage of cell typing, which was seeded by the morphological types identified during the first and second stages. It was possible to demonstrate the self-consistency of the final cell types using connectivity-based features only."
4219,"We expect that it should be possible to eliminate all dependence on morphological typing and base the approach on connectivity from start to finish. This challenge is left for future work. Spatial organization of connectivity According to our wiring diagrams, whether two neurons are connected depends on their cell types."
4220,"Connectivity also depends on the locations of the neurons in the retinotopic maps of the optic lobe. As a trivial example, it is impossible for cells with small arbors to be connected if they are at distant locations. Less trivial dependencies of connectivity on location also exist."
4221,"We expect them to be important for understanding vision, although they turned out to be unnecessary for classifying cell types. To facilitate spatial analyses of connectivity, the FlyWire Codex maps a number of cell types to locations in the hexagonal lattice of columns and ommatidia. In such analyses, it may be helpful to regard cell types and spatial locations as discrete and continuous latent variables."
4222,A companion paper demonstrates how to predict visual function by characterizing how connectivity depends on both cell type and spatial location. The cell types of cluster 2 are predicted to exhibit orientation selectivity and related phenomena reminiscent of the primary visual cortex.
4223,"This paper began by recounting the story of how wiring diagrams for the visual cortex drawn in the 1960s inspired convolutional nets, which eventually sparked the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence."
4224,"Convolutional nets have now been applied to reconstruct the fly brain from electron microscopy images, making the current study possible. Coming full circle, the fly optic lobe turns out to be as literal an implementation of a convolutional net as one could ever expect from a biological system. The columns of the optic lobe form a hexagonal lattice, rather than the square lattice used in computer vision, but it is a highly regular lattice nonetheless, and the activities of the neurons in each cell type are analogous to a feature map in a convolutional net."
4225,"Although the connectional architecture of the optic lobe conforms closely to the definition of a convolutional net, the connections do not appear to be learned in the sense of artificial intelligence. No changes in VPN structure and function, and only subtle changes in visual behavior have been detected after rearing flies in darkness, suggesting that visual experience may have little role in Drosophila visual development. However, mechanisms based on spontaneous activity in the pupal brain might have a role."
4226,"Implications for mammalian cell types In the central brain of Drosophila, cell types usually consist of just a pair of mirror-symmetric neurons, as is also the case for C. elegans. By contrast, most optic lobe cell types are represented by many neurons, a situation that is more reminiscent of mammalian brains."
4227,"Could our connectomic approach generalize to mammalian brain structures such as the retina and cortex, which are laminated like the optic lobe? Single-cell transcriptomics, often hailed as the solution to classifying cortical cell types, has also been applied to the Drosophila optic lobe. One study reported 172 transcriptomic cell types, a figure that includes VPNs as well as intrinsic neurons."
4228,"Our connectomic study has revealed the existence of a much larger set of types. Encouragingly, many connectomic types can be conclusively matched with transcriptomic types. Failures to match are interesting because they illustrate potential pitfalls of the transcriptomic approach."
4229,"For example, all eight T4/T5 types look like a single transcriptomic type in adult flies and are only transcriptionally distinct at earlier stages of development. This could be analogous to the fact that adult cortical neurons of the same transcriptomic type can have highly variable morphological properties. It will be important to scale up the connectomic approach and make it as definitive for the cortex as it is now for the fly visual system."
4230,"A first attempt has already been made in the visual cortex. As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function."
4231,"Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analyzing its structure to predict that three Dm3 and three TmY cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning, position invariance, and the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
4232,"The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision. The 40,000 neurons in the optic lobe of the Drosophila brain have now been completely classified into cell types."
4233,"Although the 200+ cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe are well defined by structural analysis, their functions are largely unknown because less than 20% have had their visual responses recorded by neurophysiologists. For the most part, at present, the online catalogue of visual cell types is an enigmatic museum of structures without functions. A beautiful example is Dm3, a trio of neuronal cell types that are intrinsic to the distal medulla."
4234,"A Dm3 cell is tangentially oriented and is orthogonal to the columnar cells that project from the medulla to other neuropils. The three Dm3 types are easily distinguished from each other because their dendrites point in three directions. For interactive visualizations of cells and pathways, see the URLs in Supplementary Data."
4235,Dm3 was originally called the line amacrine cell when it was discovered in 1970 in dipterans. It was named Dm3 in Drosophila in 1989 and split into two types in 2015. A third Dm3 type was recently identified in a large-scale connectomic census.
4236,No recordings of Dm3 visual responses have ever been reported by physiologists. Dm3 function has remained unknown. I will begin by attempting to predict Dm3 function from structure.
4237,"The field of connectomics has been motivated by a conviction that the computational capabilities of the brain depend strongly on the connectome. Indeed, neural circuit functions such as the computation of visual motion, heading direction, and reward and punishment signals are now known to be supported by specific patterns of neural connectivity in the Drosophila brain. These successes of structural explanation came after neurophysiologists had already identified circuit functions."
4238,"The present study attempts to go beyond explaining post facto. I tackle the challenge of predicting function ex ante, a more stringent test of the power of structure–function relationships. Predictions of Dm3 receptive fields: The receptive field of a visual neuron was classically defined as “the region of the retina which must be illuminated in order to obtain a response.”"
4239,"I predict Dm3 receptive fields by mapping their input connections from Tm1, a cell type that is in one-to-one correspondence with the hexels of the compound eye. Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3, and Dm3 is a strong output of Tm1. Figure 1e shows a typical Dm3 cell receiving strong Tm1 input in three collinear columns, even though the cell extends over many columns."
4240,The Tm1 cells presynaptic to each Dm3v cell were mapped to a hexagonal lattice. The color of each hexel indicates the number of synapses received by the Dm3v cell from Tm1 cells. Aligning and averaging all maps yielded an average Tm1–Dm3v input map.
4241,This procedure was repeated for all three Dm3 types. The resulting average maps show that the three Dm3 types are aligned to the three cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. Cell-to-cell variation is visible in the individual maps for single Dm3 cells.
4242,"To quantify variability, each Tm1–Dm3 connectivity map was approximated as an ellipse. The distributions of angular orientations for the Dm3 populations overlap little, and the median angles are close to the cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The aspect ratios of the ellipses have median values near 4 for all Dm3 populations."
4243,"To further characterize the size and shape of the predicted receptive fields, one-dimensional projections of Tm1–Dm3 maps were computed. The longitudinal and transverse projections provide information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively. Standard deviations are marked to provide information about variability across cells."
4244,"The Tm1 receptive field is radially symmetric, with a center that is about one ommatidium wide. As this is so narrow, Tm1–Dm3 connectivity maps can be regarded as estimates of Dm3 receptive fields, assuming that a Dm3 cell sums inputs from its presynaptic Tm1 cells. Orientation selectivity was discovered in the mammalian primary visual cortex and found to be related to the spatial orientation of the receptive field."
4245,"As the predicted receptive fields of Dm3 are oriented, I likewise predict that Dm3 cells prefer stimuli at the three cardinal orientations. Although Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3 by a large margin, Dm3 also receives weaker input from other “hexel cell types.” Maps of their connectivity with Dm3 look similar to Tm1–Dm3 maps."
4246,"Like Tm1, these inputs are known to have receptive field centers that are roughly a single ommatidium in width and therefore are not expected to change the shape of the receptive field estimated from Tm1. All of these inputs are consistent with the prediction that Dm3 cells have OFF receptive fields. Predictions of TmY receptive fields top targets of Dm3 include TmY4 and TmY9, which project from the distal medulla to the lobula and lobula plate."
4247,"In the distal medulla, TmY4 dendrites are horizontally oriented, extending symmetrically on two sides of the main trunk. TmY9 has been split into TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. In the distal medulla, both TmY9 types have dendrites that are asymmetrically directed to one side of the main trunk along the q and q⟂ directions."
4248,"Tm1 is one of the top inputs to TmY4 and TmY9. Once again, I predict receptive fields by mapping Tm1 inputs. The average maps have three distinct orientations."
4249,Cell-to-cell variability is visualized by approximating ellipses. The median orientations of the TmY4 and TmY9q⟂ ellipses are well approximated by the horizontal and q⟂ orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The median orientation of the TmY9q ellipses is between the q and p⟂ orientations and closer to q.
4250,"Roughly speaking, each TmY orientation is orthogonal to one of the Dm3 orientations, although the orthogonality of TmY9q and Dm3p is less than perfect. Aspect ratios of the ellipses indicate the degree of anisotropy. Longitudinal and transverse 1D projections of Tm1–TmY maps provide complementary information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively."
4251,"From these estimates of receptive fields, TmY4, TmY9q, and TmY9q⟂ are predicted to prefer visual stimuli at the horizontal, q, and q⟂ orientations, respectively. On the basis of their strong Tm1 inputs, TmY4 and TmY9 are predicted to be OFF cells, although they also receive input from the ON hexel type Mi1. Monosynaptic inputs to individual TmY cells from Tm1, Mi1, and other hexel types are mapped in supplementary data."
4252,"Connectivity between Dm3 and TmY types: Dm3 and TmY neurons are also connected with each other. Dm3 is presumed to be inhibitory in its synaptic effects on other cells, while TmY is presumed to be excitatory, based on evidence from both electron micrographs and transcriptomic data. Each Dm3 type avoids synapsing onto cells of the same type and prefers to synapse onto the other two Dm3 types, which have different dendrite orientations."
4253,"Each Dm3 type prefers to synapse onto a single TmY type that has the orthogonal dendrite orientation. Therefore, Dm3 output connectivity conforms to cross-orientation inhibition, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 50 years ago. TmY cells prefer to synapse onto TmY cells of the same type."
4254,"It follows that TmY–TmY connectivity conforms approximately to iso-orientation excitation, a connectivity motif proposed for the visual cortex more than 40 years ago. In addition, there is some weaker connectivity from TmY9q to TmY9q⟂. TmY4 and TmY9q cells synapse onto Dm3 cells of the orthogonal orientation."
4255,"By contrast, TmY9q⟂ shows no preference, synapsing onto Dm3 cells of all orientations. Therefore, TmY-to-Dm3 connectivity is a combination of cross-orientation and indiscriminate connectivity. The above connectivity patterns are represented schematically in the figure. This is effectively a thresholded version that will be used in subsequent analyses."
4256,"The figure illustrates a Dm3 cell synapsing onto another Dm3 cell, which in turn synapses onto a TmY cell. Another figure illustrates reciprocally connected TmY4 cells. These visualizations suggest that there are spatial relationships between the connected cells, which are not described by population-level wiring diagrams."
4257,The consequences of these spatial relationships for the visual responses of cells will be predicted below. Dm3 extraclassical receptive fields: The receptive field predictions were for the “classical” receptive field.
4258,"For some visual neurons, stimulation of areas outside the classical receptive field may modulate the response to stimulation of the classical receptive field. These areas are sometimes called the “extraclassical” receptive field. By definition, stimulating the extraclassical receptive field alone should not result in any response."
4259,"The amount of modulation induced by ERF stimulation may depend on the orientation, contrast, or other properties of the modulating stimulus. Locations outside an oriented CRF near the longitudinal axis will be called the end zones, and locations near the transverse axis will be called the side zones. I propose that the ERF of Dm3 cells is determined by disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3. I searched for such pathways with the greatest anatomical strength. In brief, the strength of the A-to-B connection was defined as the fraction of input synapses to cell type B provided by cell type A."
4260,"The strength of the A-to-B-to-C disynaptic pathway was then defined as the product of the A-to-B and B-to-C strengths. Details about this strength estimate and its limitations are given in the Methods. Strong disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 were mapped, aligned, and averaged across Dm3 cells."
4261,"For each Dm3 type, the average disynaptic pathway map overlaps with the average predicted CRF but also extends beyond it. The beyond-the-CRF portion of each disynaptic pathway map will be regarded as a component of the predicted ERF. Henceforth, ""pERF"" and ""pCRF"" will be used as abbreviations for the predicted ERF component and predicted CRF, respectively."
4262,"As the maps do not have sharp borders, they will be approximated as ellipses for the purpose of defining beyond-the-CRF regions. For each Dm3 type, the strongest two pERFs are from the other two Dm3 types. These mostly extend into the side zones of the pCRF and are predicted to be suppressive because Dm3 is presumed inhibitory."
4263,Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. The next strongest pERF is mediated by T2a and is predicted to be facilitating because T2a is presumed excitatory. The T2a-mediated average pERF covers both end zones of the Dm3v pCRF and mainly the posterior end zone of the Dm3p and Dm3q pCRFs.
4264,"Ellipse approximations to Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps for individual Dm3 cells show that their orientations tend to be similar to those of the Dm3 pCRFs. For some Dm3p and Dm3q cells, the Tm1–T2a–Dm3 map is small and located in the pCRF end zone, not overlapping with the pCRF at all. This shows up as a hotspot in the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps."
4265,1D projections of the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps show that they tend to be longer than the pCRFs and result in pERFs that are biased towards the posterior pCRF end zone of Dm3p and Dm3q. The remaining disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 are substantially weaker by anatomical strength but are included for completeness because they might turn out to be physiologically strong. It is not easy to predict the overall effect at locations where suppressive and facilitating pERFs overlap.
4266,"I predict that suppression will be prominent in the pCRF side zones, where the Dm3-mediated pERFs seem numerically stronger. In the end zones, the T2a-mediated pERFs are largely unopposed by suppression and should lead to facilitation that is not selective for orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus. pERFs for individual Dm3 cells are provided in Supplementary Data 3."
4267,"There is considerable variability across cells of the same type, but the geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. To predict the ERF of TmY cells, I consider disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to TmY types. The strongest pathways are mediated by Dm3, and the resulting pERF covers mainly the pCRF side zones and is expected to be suppressive."
4268,"Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning. Of the weaker pERFs that are facilitating, the TmY–TmY pERF extends the farthest into the pCRF end zones. Ellipse approximations show the degree of variability across cells."
4269,"One-dimensional projections show that the pERF extends into both end zones. This pathway could lead to iso-orientation facilitation in the end zones, as the TmY–TmY connections are between the same TmY type. The extension of the facilitating TmY–TmY pERF into the pCRF end zones is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity aids in the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
4270,"A similar “collinear facilitation” in the visual cortex has been proposed to enable the completion of noisy or illusory contours, because an orientation detector receiving weak or ambiguous input from the image can be driven over threshold by excitation from neighboring orientation detectors. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones. This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity."
4271,"pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in supplementary data. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. Prediction of spatial normalization The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute."
4272,"Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute to a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation. In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY."
4273,"A similar excitatory–inhibitory motif is found for many types in the Dm interneuron family and can be viewed as implementing spatial normalization, a common computation in image processing. The inhibitory neuron pools the activity of excitatory neurons over some spatial neighborhood and sends recurrent inhibition back to the same excitatory neurons. An unusual aspect here is that recurrent inhibition in the Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY pathway is opposed by recurrent excitation in the Tm1–TmY–TmY pathway in the case of side-by-side stimuli at the preferred orientation."
4274,"Pathways leaving the optic lobe have predicted that the three Dm3 and three TmY types respond selectively to the local orientation of a visual stimulus. This is conceptualized as a decomposition of the image into small oriented elements such as edges or bars, similar to early visual processing in computer science as well as models of the visual cortex. In such models, the computation of local orientation is a general starting point for recognizing all visual forms by subsequent processing steps."
4275,"Similarly, information about local stimulus orientation might be used by the fly brain for form vision. TmY cells synapse onto a number of visual projection neurons that project out of the optic lobe into the central brain. I will focus on the most numerous of these VPN types, LC15 and LC10e, which number about 50 cells each."
4276,"These are of particular interest because they retain more information about location and are therefore potentially more useful for recognizing complex visual forms. The other VPNs, by contrast, discard more information about location by pooling widely over space and will be studied elsewhere. LC15 invariance to orientation LC15 neurons project from the lobula to the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, a neuropil in the central brain."
4277,"LC15 receives input from all three TmY types. Direct connections from hexel types to LC15 are weak or nonexistent, so here the top disynaptic pathways are mapped to predict feature selectivity. Aligning and averaging the maps yields results."
4278,Maps for individual cells are in Supplementary Data 5 and are summarized by ellipses in Fig. 6c.
4279,"Given that LC15 input from TmY cells of all three orientations is indiscriminate, it is natural to reason that LC15 responds indiscriminately to any orientation, detecting a disjunction of activity in the three channels. If TmY orientation tuning is sufficiently broad, it follows that LC15 should be activated by a stimulus of any orientation. Indeed, recordings of LC15 visual responses show that LC15 is activated by bars of any orientation."
4280,"Other strong intermediaries of disynaptic pathways include T3, Tm25, and Tm21. T3 is known to be a small-object detector, and Tm25 and Tm21 may be object detectors based on their connectivity. Indeed, recordings of LC15 responses show that LC15 is also activated by small objects, although not as strongly as by bars."
4281,LC10e may serve as a possible junction detector. LC10 neurons project from the lobula to the anterior optic tubercle of the central brain. LC10 has been divided into four types with distinct stratification profiles in the lobula. I identified a new LC10e type and further subdivided it into dorsal and ventral variants based on their distinct connectivity patterns.
4282,"Both variants receive inputs from TmY9 types, but these inputs are stronger for LC10ev, so I will focus on it. Disynaptic pathways starting from hexel types were mapped, and the top intermediaries turned out to be TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. The maps were aligned and averaged."
4283,The average Tm1–TmY9q–LC10ev map is to the left of the average Tm1–TmY9q⟂–LC10ev map. The displacement vectors between ellipse centers are within 90° of the q direction for almost all LC10ev cells. This suggests a systematic spatial relationship between the receptive field components mediated by TmY9q and TmY9q⟂.
4284,"Noisiness in this relationship is evident in the maps for individual cells, but many individual cells are consistent with the systematic relationship. Although LC10ev receives input from both TmY9q and TmY9q⟂, it is unclear how these two pathways interact. One possibility is that LC10ev, like LC15, detects a disjunction of activity in the two pathways and responds to a stimulus at either the q or q⟂ orientation."
4285,"Another possibility is that LC10ev detects a conjunction of activity in the two pathways. In the latter case, LC10ev could be a detector of corners or T-junctions, owing to the systematic spatial relationship evident in the figures."
4286,"This is just speculation because there are additional strong inputs to LC10ev other than TmY9, and it is unclear how they shape the feature selectivity of LC10ev. Motion, object, and color vision TmY pERFs mediated by T4 and T5 cells cover the pCRF end zones and are facilitating. T4 and T5 neurons are activated by motion and are also known to prefer oriented stimuli."
4287,"Therefore, input from the motion system may enhance the orientation selectivity of TmY cells and also cause TmY responses to be stronger for moving stimuli than for flashed stimuli. Dm3 inputs and outputs do not contain cell types known to encode motion direction. TmY4 receives inhibition from several lobula plate interneurons, including the full-field cells LPi14 and LPi15, which are presumed to be inhibitory and receive strong input from T4a and T5a, and from T4b and T5b, respectively."
4288,"This suggests that TmY4 might be suppressed by horizontal background motion. TmY9q⟂ receives input from LPi07, suggesting that TmY9q⟂ might be suppressed by vertical background motion if LPi07 is inhibitory, because LPi07 receives input from T4c and T5c, as well as from T4d and T5d. TmY outputs include motion-related types."
4289,"TmY4 synapses onto LPi07 cells, which synapse onto T4c and T5c, as well as from T4d and T5d. TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ synapse onto a number of types that are reciprocally coupled to T4 and T5 cells. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones."
4290,This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity. pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in Supplementary Data 4.

4309,"Recordings of these additional intermediary types have not been reported, but a companion paper uses connectivity to speculate that they are involved in color vision. By interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram, I have predicted visual responses of Drosophila neurons that have not previously been recorded by neurophysiologists."
4310,"Testing these predictions seems bound to be informative, whether or not they turn out to be correct. CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted by mapping monosynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells and were found to be oriented. On this basis, Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted to be orientation selective."
4311,"pERFs were predicted by mapping disynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells, which involve connections in the Dm3–TmY circuit. A Dm3 pERF mediated by other Dm3 types was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to non-preferred orientations. A Dm3 pERF mediated by T2a was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and not tuned to the orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus."
4312,"A TmY pERF mediated by TmY was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and near side zones, and tuned to modulating stimuli at the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF mediated by Dm3 was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to modulating stimuli orthogonal to the pCRF orientation. A TmY pERF due to a trisynaptic pathway mediated by both the same TmY type and the orthogonal Dm3 type was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones for stimuli at the pCRF orientation."
4313,"Although my predictions are powerfully concrete and specific, they also have limitations. First, I relied on the fundamental assumption that the CRF arises from monosynaptic connectivity and that the ERF arises from polysynaptic pathways that are not paralleled by a monosynaptic connection. One can be confident about the assumption for an inhibitory pathway such as Tm1–Dm3v–TmY4, which by itself should be incapable of activating the TmY4 cell."
4314,"However, stimulating an excitatory pathway such as Tm1–TmY4–TmY4 could conceivably activate the final TmY4 cell, even if the direct Tm1–TmY4 pathway is not stimulated. In general, my fundamental assumption is more certain for inhibitory and less certain for excitatory polysynaptic pathways. If experiments show that the size and shape of CRFs match the predictions I made, then the fundamental assumption will be upheld, and further experiments can proceed to look for the predicted facilitating and suppressive ERF components. On the other hand, if the CRF turns out to be longer than predicted, that would mean excitatory polysynaptic pathways, which are predicted to contribute to the ERF, instead turn out to lengthen the CRF. The prediction of a facilitating ERF in the CRF end zone would become invalid because the end zone would be swallowed up by the lengthened CRF."
4315,The ERF would then be determined solely by inhibitory polysynaptic pathways and be only suppressive. The above uncertainty is related to some ambiguity inherent in the ERF definition. It is supposed to be impossible to evoke a neural response through stimulation of the ERF alone.
4316,"If the definition is revised to substitute ""difficult"" for ""impossible,"" the distinction between ERF and CRF is no longer black and white. In the second limitation, predictions can be challenging due to the existence of many polysynaptic pathways that can contribute to the ERF. When relevant pathways are both excitatory and inhibitory, it can be difficult to predict the overall sign of modulation by a stimulus outside the CRF."
4317,"I have accordingly focused my ERF predictions on locations where either excitation or inhibition is likely to dominate. However, there are additional ERF pathways that were not considered above. For example, a companion paper predicts numerous normalization mechanisms that are presynaptic to the Dm3–TmY circuit: Tm1 responses are spatially normalized by five Pm interneuron types that pool over multiple length scales, L2 is normalized by three Dm interneuron types, and the L2–Tm1 connection is normalized by two Dm interneuron types."
4318,"All of these mechanisms are expected to contribute suppressive ERF components that are not tuned to stimulus orientation and could obscure the predicted facilitating ERF components. A third limitation concerns variation across cells of the same type, which is summarized by the ellipses in Figs. 1h, 2j, 4d, 5d, 6c, f and detailed in Supplementary Data 3–5."
4319,"A systematic kind of variation is the distortion of geometric relationships near the borders of the eye. There is also apparently random variation even in the interior of the eye, far from the borders. pERFs tend to look more variable than pCRFs, which may be due in part to randomness in the coverage of the visual field by non-hexel types."
4320,"Finally, my conjecture about LC10e assumes a high threshold for activation, which suggests that LC10e should detect a conjunction of TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ activation, triggered by two oriented stimuli arranged in a corner or T-junction. Alternatively, LC10e might detect a disjunction of its inputs if it has a low threshold for activation. LC15 is indiscriminately connected with all three TmY types, and its observed invariance to stimulus orientation suggests that LC15 has a low threshold for activation."
4321,"An additional subtlety, not further discussed here, is that threshold actually varies dynamically owing to the presence of inhibitory inputs. In principle, some of the above limitations could be overcome by building network models of neural activity. That might not improve the predictive power at this time, however, because so many model parameters are unknown."
4322,"Synapse counts are only crude estimates of physiological connection strength, and unitary conductance can differ markedly between inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Other uncertainties, such as whether inhibition should be modeled as subtractive or divisive, go beyond parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out experiments that reduce model uncertainty."
4323,"If visual physiologists measure orientation and location tuning curves, that would constrain the strength of cross-orientation inhibition relative to direct Tm1 excitation, as well as the relative strengths of ERF pathways. Biophysical experiments would clarify the extent to which voltage varies throughout a neuronal arbor, which is important because pCRF and pERF pathways may terminate in synapses at different locations on the arbor. Discussion: Convolutional nets are a popular approach to form vision in artificial intelligence."
4324,"Optic lobe cell types can be interpreted as feature maps in a convolutional net, and average Tm1–Dm3 and Tm1–TmY connectivity maps can be interpreted as convolution kernels. LC10e and LC15 combine inputs from TmY cells and may be regarded as complex feature detectors built by combining inputs from simpler feature detectors. This accords with the original hierarchical conception of convolutional nets, which was inspired by hypothetical wiring diagrams for primary visual cortex in mammals."
4325,"The wiring of the Dm3–TmY circuit resembles connectivity motifs originally proposed for V1, and some visual responses predicted here for fly neurons have precedents in V1. In particular, a ""collinear facilitation"" is predicted for the ERF of TmY cells, meaning that a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the end zone can facilitate the response to a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the CRF. Collinear facilitation was previously reported for V1 neurons, but most reports emphasize suppression."
4326,"The conflicting reports might be reconciled if ERFs are generated by diverse parallel polysynaptic pathways. Different visual stimuli might emphasize either excitatory or inhibitory pathways, leading to different experimental results. The ERFs of TmY cells are similarly predicted to be shaped by many overlapping excitatory and inhibitory pathways, but the complexity is constrained by the connectome."
4327,"We can reason about the cell types and connections, observe and manipulate them with the aid of genetic tools, and use them to build neural network models. This new opportunity has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods used to disentangle the effects of overlapping ERF mechanisms in the cortex, such as manipulating stimulus contrast, orientation, and timing. ""Line amacrine"" cells, probably homologous to Dm3, have been described in several dipteran species."
4328,"If Dm3 and TmY homologues turn out to exist in honeybees, it will be worth comparing them with studies of honeybee behaviour, with the caveat that visual acuity is higher, and inter-ommatidial spacing is lower in honeybees than in Drosophila. Behavioural experiments were interpreted to infer the existence of ""at least three orientation-sensitive channels"" in the bee visual system. Orientation-selective neurons were later predicted to span a maximum of three ommatidia."
4329,"This roughly matches the predicted CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells. It is worth noting that Dm3 receptive fields would not previously have been guessed to be so short because Dm3 dendrites are quite long. The predicted CRFs require true connectivity, not just morphology."
4330,"The collinear facilitation predicted for TmY cells could have consequences for insect visual behaviours. Bees were once claimed to perceive illusory contours. The experiments were later declared to be irreproducible, although this belated renunciation seems to have escaped notice."
4331,The topic seems worth reopening if neurophysiology experiments can detect the collinear facilitation predicted here. The design of illusory contour stimuli seems more likely to be successful if guided by neurophysiology as well as behaviour. Behavioural experiments with honeybees were used to argue that the orientation of a visual stimulus is computed independently from its direction of motion.
4332,"Orientation selectivity was subsequently discovered in direction-selective T4 and T5 cells of Drosophila. The present work predicts an orientation-selective Dm3–TmY circuit that is indeed distinct from the motion circuit, although there are interactions between them as described above. The Dm3–TmY circuit immediately suggests many questions about neural development."
4333,"Unknowns include the identities of the molecules that guide Dm3 dendrites to grow in three directions, and how the Dm3 dendrites ""decide"" how far to grow, even after turning sharply at the border of the medulla. The molecules that establish connectivity preferences of Dm3 and TmY cells are of obvious interest. There should also be molecules that establish preferences for synapse formation at particular dendritic locations, which are important for the spatial organization of connectivity and remain to be analyzed in future work."
4334,"Many animals use visual information to navigate, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction by integrating visual input from ER neurons, which are part of the anterior visual pathway. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron microscopy data."
4335,"The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle in the central brain; TuBu neurons, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes, and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input."
4336,"We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations. The AVP encodes visual features that are essential for navigation, potentially including landmarks, intensity gradients, colour, celestial bodies, and skylight polarization."
4337,"Considering its fundamental role in navigation, it is not surprising that this anatomical structure is largely conserved across most known insect species. It is likely that deep similarities exist across species in the basic logic of visual feature extraction for navigation. However, despite many studies of the AVP across species, researchers’ knowledge about the AVP neurons has been fragmented by the lack of a complete circuit diagram to frame systematic investigations."
4338,"Here we aim to provide such a framework in flies, and we anticipate that this will also be invaluable for designing and prioritizing physiological experiments to interrogate the AVP in other species. We identified all neurons and their connectivity in the AVP using a publicly available electron microscopy dataset that contains the entire adult fly brain, with FlyWire, an AI-assisted collaborative platform. MeTu neurons, the first stage of the AVP, leave the medulla, the largest neuropil in the fly visual system."
4339,"The axons of MeTu neurons innervate the AOTUsu, where the information is further processed by the TuBu neurons that connect the AOTUsu to the bulb. There are ten classes of TuBu neurons, each synapsing onto the dendrites of distinct classes of ER neurons. ER neurons then send ring-like processes to a donut-shaped structure, the ellipsoid body, where they together form a complex recurrent neural network."
4340,"Finally, the visual information from the AVP—along with other sensory modalities—is compiled to compute the heading direction by EPG neurons that share many similarities with mammalian “head direction” cells. Our survey of the entire brain showed that visual information originating from optic lobe structures outside the AVP constitutes minimal input to EPG neurons. Thus, we focused our analyses on the medulla-originating AVP."
4341,"Furthermore, although previous anatomical studies of various types of MeTu neurons have generally agreed at the macroscale, the insufficient resolution of light microscopy has resulted in considerable inconsistencies in grouping MeTu types and predicting their connectivity towards the central complex. Hence, we sought to provide a comprehensive view of this pathway in synapse-level detail. Finally, although the connectivity from TuBu to ER to EPG neurons has been studied at synaptic resolution, this dataset contains only one hemisphere and lacks upstream medulla neuropils and photoreceptor terminals."
4342,"Therefore, we sought to reconstruct the entire AVP in both hemispheres to provide a solid foundation for understanding how brains vary across hemispheres and across animals, as well as which visual features are extracted in the AVP. Reconstruction of the AVP involved densely proofreading all MeTu neurons, TuBu neurons, and ER neurons. We further reconstructed all medulla-intrinsic Mi1 neurons in the medulla from both hemispheres to map the exact locations of all reconstructed neurons relative to the retinotopic columns in the medulla."
4343,"To assess our proofreading quality, we selected 113 MeTu neurons from the right hemisphere and performed multiple rounds of proofreading. We found that—after the first round—any additional volume reconstructed in each round markedly decreased, and there were no changes in the main backbone. Moreover, all MeTu neurons shared stereotypical arborization patterns in the medulla."
4344,"Therefore, we were confident that our reconstruction quality of the 894 MeTu neurons was sufficiently accurate for categorization and morphological and connectivity analyses. We focused on the detailed connectivity of MeTu neurons because the logic of their connections between optic lobes and the central brain was missing in previous studies. We included results from both hemispheres in most analyses, but where indicated, some detailed analyses were restricted to the right hemisphere because the left hemisphere had an incomplete lamina and EM image alignment issues."
4345,"AOTUsu anatomy defines four MeTu classes. The AOTUsu is innervated by four types of processes: the axons of MeTu neurons; the dendrites of downstream TuBu neurons; and the synaptic terminals of bilaterally projecting AOTU and tubercle-to-tubercle neurons. Drawing on the axonal arborization pattern of MeTu and the dendritic arborization pattern of TuBu, we divided the AOTUsu into four major subregions: posterior lateral, posterior central, anterior, and medial. These anatomical divisions led us to categorize MeTu neurons into four major classes."
4346,"Downstream TuBu neurons were categorized into ten types, consistent with previous work."
4347,"Connectivity reveals ten MeTu subtypes. Within each MeTu class except MeTu1, we observed discrete morphologies and anatomical innervations, suggesting multiple channels for visual features. To systematically categorize all possible MeTu neuron subtypes, we focused our analysis on the five strongest synaptic partner types; this resulted in 28 types of upstream neurons. Applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction analysis based on the connectivity in the medulla but not in the AOTUsu revealed four major patterns of presynaptic inputs, mostly consistent with the four major MeTu classes defined in the previous section."
4348,"We also performed categorization analyses and found ten subtypes. Comparing the expression pattern of genetic driver lines with EM data further corroborated our subtyping of MeTu neurons. MeTu1 neurons form a homogeneous group. Compass neurons are strongly influenced by vertical stripes and their locations in azimuth, whose information is conveyed by ER neurons, probably ER4d."
4349,"This ER neuron type is the only partner downstream of TuBu08, which is, in turn, the only neuron type downstream of MeTu1 neurons. Our analysis of the anatomy and connectivity of MeTu1 neurons helps to explain the mechanisms that underlie the selectivity of ER4d neurons. MeTu1 neurons form thick dendritic branches in the medulla layer 7, with small vertical protrusions extending to layer 6. Dendrites span about 30–40 medulla columns, and each medulla column is innervated by multiple MeTu1 neurons."
4350,"MeTu1 neurons receive the strongest input from Dm2 neurons covering the entire visual field, followed by Sm16, MeTu1, Sm15, and Sm07. The density of synapses drops at a distance of 20 to 30 μm from the medulla centroid of a MeTu1 neuron. The functional implication of recurrent connections between MeTu1 neurons in the medulla remains to be examined."
4351,"The orientation of the MeTu1 dendritic span, when fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, tends to be vertical. We observe that, near the anterior and posterior edges, the dendritic spans of MeTu neurons narrow, but future studies are required to ascertain whether this change has functional implications. MeTu1 neurons project axons to the AOTUsu_PL, where they synapse with TuBu08 neurons, among other connections."
4352,"The connection from MeTu1 neurons to TuBu08 neurons is retinotopic; the more anteriorly or posteriorly MeTu1 dendrites are located in the medulla, the more ventrally or dorsally they project in the AOTUsu_PL, respectively. In other words, each TuBu08 neuron receives input from a group of MeTu1 neurons at a particular azimuth, regardless of their elevation in the medulla. Such one-dimensional mapping provides a potential anatomical basis for the selectivity of TuBu08 neurons to vertical bars or to the azimuthal location of visual stimuli, but not to elevation, an anatomical structure similar to the classic Hubel & Wiesel model of how simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus."
4353,"MeTu2 subtypes process polarized light. Many insects navigate relying on skylight polarization. In Drosophila, ER4m neurons are the prominent ER neurons that process skylight polarization. MeTu2 neurons, previously designated as MeTu-DRA, are notable as the only upstream inputs of these ER neurons."
4354,"They are clustered in the dorsal half of the medulla, with dendrites mainly tiling the dorsal rim area, where neurons process skylight polarization. Our clustering analysis identified two MeTu2 subtypes with distinct ramifications in the medulla and notably distinct connectivity patterns in the AOTUsu_PC, which we named MeTu2a and MeTu2b. Both subtypes exhibit generally vertical arborizations and similar dendritic spans, but the interconnectivity between MeTu2b in the medulla is much stronger than that between MeTu2a."
4355,"Furthermore, MeTu2b neurons appear to receive more input from MeTu2a than they provide input to MeTu2a. Finally, although both MeTu2 subtypes mainly stratify within medulla layer 7, MeTu2a neurons are postsynaptic to polarization-sensitive R7 neurons only in the DRA and local interneurons DmDRA1, both of which are potentially sensitive to light polarization, whereas MeTu2b inputs also include Mi15, the function of which remains unknown, and a stronger connection from interhemispheric MeMeDRA. Hence, MeTu2b might integrate additional inputs from the contralateral hemisphere, enabling the processing of a more global skylight polarization pattern."
4356,"MeTu2 innervation of the AOTUsu respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1. Also, as in the medulla, MeTu2b neurons are more strongly interconnected in the AOTUsu than are MeTu2a neurons. Moreover, although MeTu2a and MeTu2b both synapse onto TuBu01 and TuBu06, MeTu2b is only weakly connected to TuBu01."
4357,"Finally, MeTu2a and MeTu2b differ in their connections to the bilateral neurons TuTuB_a and TuTuB_b. Overall, these connectivity differences in the AOTUsu_PC, combined with their distinct anatomical features in the medulla, indicate that MeTu2a and MeTu2b are likely to convey distinct features of skylight polarization to downstream circuits, with MeTu2b processing potentially more complex and global polarization patterns. MeTu3 neurons comprise three subtypes. The Drosophila compass neurons can use the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding world to compute head direction, but the source of this information was unclear."
4358,"Here, we provide evidence that MeTu3 and its downstream neurons process, in addition to skylight polarization, the two-dimensional organization of the scene. Our connectivity analysis identified three distinct MeTu3 subtypes with regionalized clusters of dendrites. MeTu3a has dendrites that cluster in the dorsal third of the medulla, are confined to layer 7, and specifically lack vertical protrusions across medulla layers."
4359,"MeTu3a is the only MeTu3 subtype that receives polarization information through input from DmDRA1, similar to MeTu2a and MeTu2b. MeTu3b cells have dendrites that are clustered most densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend to the ventral two-thirds, with pronounced vertical protrusions that cover layers 5, 6, and 7. They receive direct inhibitory input from ultraviolet-sensitive R7 photoreceptors and indirect input from blue/green-sensitive R8 cells through Mi15, which suggests that they have a role in processing chromatic information."
4360,"MeTu3c cells have dendrites that are more ventral than those of MeTu3b, covering the equator and some of the ventral part of the medulla. Dendritic processes innervate the same layers as MeTu3b and receive the same direct and indirect photoreceptor inputs, suggesting similar chromatic coding to that of MeTu3b. MeTu3 innervation of the AOTUsu_A respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1 and MeTu2."
4361,"Axons of MeTu3a, MeTu3b, and MeTu3c are not well segregated in the AOTUsu_A, despite the downstream TuBu neurons having well-segregated dendrites. Consequently, some MeTu3 neurons are connected to two TuBu types. All three MeTu3 subtypes are strongly and reciprocally connected to bilateral TuTuB_a neurons."
4362,"Because the TuTuB_a neurotransmitter is predicted to be inhibitory, MeTu3 neurons might exhibit strong bilateral inhibitory interactions across the entire visual field. MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons are mainly connected to TuBu07, upstream of ER3w_ab. This convergence of MeTu3a and MeTu3b suggests that ER3w_ab encodes a combination of skylight polarization and chromatic information of the sky."
4363,"On the other hand, MeTu3c neurons are mostly presynaptic to both TuBu09 and TuBu10. Notably, TuBu09 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more dorsally in the medulla, whereas TuBu10 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more ventrally in the medulla. Thus, the neurons downstream of MeTu3c can encode the elevation of visual stimuli or a two-dimensional organization of visual objects in a surrounding scene."
4364,"This capability is unique among all MeTu neurons. MeTu4 subtypes transmit widefield inputs. Compass neurons receive diverse input from ER neurons, some of which exhibit responses to the contralateral visual field and self-generated motion signals. Considering that these ER neurons, the dendrites of which are in the inferior bulb, are downstream of MeTu4 neurons that originate in the ipsilateral optic lobe, their response pattern was puzzling."
4365,"Our analyses show that MeTu4 neurons receive inputs from distinct parts of the visual world, with virtually no input from a columnar medulla cell type. Instead, they receive input mostly from large interneurons that span many medulla columns and from others that potentially convey motor information from a neuropil called the superior posterior slope to the medulla. These unique properties of MeTu4 might explain the mysterious properties of ER neurons in the inferior bulb."
4366,"On the basis of the connectivity in the medulla and the AOTUsu_M, we categorized MeTu4 into four subgroups: MeTu4a, MeTu4b, MeTu4c, and MeTu4d. The dendrites of MeTu4a cells cluster densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend ventrally, with unique arborization in two medulla layers. Despite their dorsal location, they form no synaptic connections with polarized light-sensitive photoreceptors or DRA neurons."
4367,"MeTu4b neurons are notable for their unique dendritic arrangement: they span a rather small area in the equator, mostly in the posterior-medial part of the medulla that represents the frontal central visual field. The function of this spatial restriction remains unknown. MeTu4c neurons span the entire dorsal half of the medulla, whereas MeTu4d neurons cluster exclusively in the ventral half of the medulla and are ideally positioned to detect features in the ventral visual field."
4368,"Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d receive nearly identical input from a wide variety of interneurons, including those that convey information from other brain areas. Like all other MeTu types, axonal projections of all MeTu4 neurons maintain anterior-posterior retinotopy in the AOTUsu_M along the ventral-dorsal axis, in contrast to what was found in a previous report. MeTu4a, MeTu4b, and MeTu4c also have presynaptic connections in the lobula, but these connections do not contribute to the AVP and were thus excluded from further analyses."
4369,"In the AOTUsu_M, all MeTu4a neurons are presynaptic to TuBu03; some are also presynaptic to TuBu04. MeTu4b neurons are presynaptic to TuBu02 neurons. Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d subtypes are mainly presynaptic to TuBu05, but MeTu4d also makes presynaptic connections with TuBu02."
4370,"MeTu4b and MeTu4c receive the main interhemispheric connections within the AOTUsu_M: MeTu4b receives strong input from AOTU046 but does not provide reciprocal input into AOTU046, whereas MeTu4c is strongly and reciprocally connected to AOTU046. MeTu4d receives no input from AOTU046 and provides only weak input to AOTU046. Finally, MeTu4d receives weak input from TuTuB_a."
4371,"Variance across hemispheres and brains: We compared the AVP within and across brains. Although our analyses are limited due to the lack of optic lobes in the hemibrain dataset and a single optic lobe in the male brain dataset, tentative comparisons are still possible for most MeTu types on the basis of synapses in the AOTU or optic lobe synapse and cell shapes. The number of neurons of each type was very similar across hemispheres of the same brain, compared to the difference across brains."
4372,"Notably, across brains, only a few cell types showed clear differences in spatial arborization patterns, numbers or, in very few cases, perhaps even their existence. For example, MeTu4b neurons in FAFB and the male brain optic lobe both have similar spatially restricted arborizations in the medulla, but the FAFB pattern lacks a few cells that are present in the male optic lobe MeTu4b population. Also, the overall number of MeTu4 cells in the male brain dataset is higher, and two other MeTu4 subtypes are identified."
4373,"Careful comparison suggests that MeTu4e in the male optic lobe could be a subset of MeTu4a in FAFB. The source of such variations across brains remains incompletely understood but is likely to be, at least in part, developmental in nature. Extracting visual features along the AVP: A common pattern across all AVP channels is the convergence of MeTu neurons onto a considerably smaller number of TuBu neurons."
4374,"In this transformation, each TuBu neuron integrates information from a large area of the visual field, suggesting spatial feature processing with a lower resolution. TuBu neurons also receive strong input from the contralateral visual field through TuTu neurons. Note that individual MeTu neurons sample the visual area differently depending on their location in the medulla over the anterior-posterior axis."
4375,This results in synapse counts and dendritic field shapes differing by their locations in the medulla along this axis. The effect of this pattern on TuBu integration is not understood at present. The next step in processing—from TuBu to ER neurons—exhibits a re-expansion in the number of neuronal types.
4376,"The ratio of connections from TuBu to ER neurons varies between 0.33 and, for some neurons, 4. Thus, the transformation from TuBu to ER may extract several more visual features."
4377,"Putative receptive fields of ER neurons: To quantify the putative visual area to which each neuron probably responds, we mapped each medulla column to a micro-computed tomography-based eye map of D. melanogaster. Then, for each ER neuron, we back-traced the upstream connections in two ways: one followed TuBu to MeTu connections and the other followed TuBu to TuTu to ipsi- and contralateral MeTu connections."
4378,"We used the dendritic arborization in the medulla for each pathway to estimate the area of a direct pathway or an indirect pathway. We overlaid them into a single putative receptive field, which we further analyzed to obtain the outline of the visual field of the direct pathway. We then combined outlines of the same type of ER neurons to illustrate the visual area that the population of ER neurons covers."
4379,"Note that the lack of functional data for most optic lobe cell types, including Sm neurons, hinders extensive functional predictions. Thus, our predictions are based mainly on the dendritic fields of MeTu neurons and the known properties of presynaptic neurons. Back-tracing the synaptic pathway starting from an ER4d revealed that its upstream MeTu1 neurons are aligned vertically in the medulla."
4380,"They cover about 40° azimuth and the entire vertical span. This vertical arrangement of MeTu1 neurons was consistent across ER4d neurons and covered the entire visual field as a population, like an array of vertical bars. It suggests that ER4d neurons are selective to vertically elongated visual stimuli or to the location of visual stimuli along the horizontal plane, regardless of the elevation."
4381,"Such a pathway would be best suited for detecting visual landmarks that are appropriate references for setting a heading. By contrast, back-tracing starting from single ER2_ad and ER2_b neurons revealed that they receive information from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located in the dorsal medulla, whereas individual ER2_c neurons receive inputs exclusively from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites in the central medulla. Similar to the channel converging into ER4d neurons, the MeTu3c populations upstream of ER2_ad, ER2_b, and ER2_c neurons tile the entire visual field."
4382,"In other words, the ER2 population tiles the visual field two-dimensionally, providing more organizational details of the scene in two dimensions than do ER4d neurons. Furthermore, the roles of ER4d and ER2 in processing chromatic information might differ: Dm2, the main upstream input of MeTu1, receives inputs predominantly from UV-sensitive pale photoreceptors, which suggests that ER4d neurons could process UV stimuli. On the other hand, Mi15, the main upstream input of MeTu3c, receives input from green-sensitive yellow R8 photoreceptors, which suggests that ER2 neurons process longer-wavelength stimuli."
4383,"Unlike the ER4d and ER2 populations, ER4m and ER5 neurons receive strong input from polarization-sensitive channels involving the DRA-specific MeTu2a and MeTu2b neurons, respectively. As described before, MeTu2b exhibits more complex connectivity than MeTu2a and, therefore, might encode complex features of polarized light. Hence, ER5 might process more complex features of polarized skylight, whereas ER4m seems to process skylight polarization alone as a navigational cue, consistent with a previous report."
4384,"This difference is notable because ER5 is involved in circadian rhythms. ER3w receives input from MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons, potentially combining skylight polarization information and localized visual feature information from some of the dorsal visual field. On the other hand, most other ER3 subtypes with dendrites in the inferior bulb are downstream of MeTu4 subtypes that do not receive columnar input in the medulla."
4385,"Thus, until the functions of upstream neurons are understood, the visual area and features that these ER3 neurons encode will remain unclear. Overall, we predict that ER neurons downstream of MeTu1–MeTu3 neurons encode diverse information including polarized light, vertical stimuli or the azimuthal location of visual features, and the two-dimensional organization of visual scenes, including azimuth and elevation, a system suitable for processing both the elevation of a celestial body and the surrounding two-dimensional environment. Physiologically testing predictions: We performed two-photon calcium imaging to test some of these predictions, especially the spatial extent of the visual field to which ER4d and ER2 neurons respond."
4386,"We imaged the dendritic calcium activity of ER neurons in the superior bulb while presenting square-shaped dot stimuli to the fly using a projector-based visual stimulation set-up. Both ER neuron types were excited by ipsilateral visual stimuli, consistent with previous studies. The ellipse contours of the receptive fields of ER4d and ER2 tile the visual space differently."
4387,"As predicted by our connectomic analysis, the receptive fields of ER4d neurons are vertically elongated in height and 31 ± 12° in width, and tile the visual space horizontally. The receptive fields of ER2 neurons, on the other hand, are markedly smaller and tile the visual space in two dimensions. These results precisely match our predictions about the spatial extent of these neurons’ receptive fields."
4388,"Note that the vertical extent of the ER4d receptive fields is much greater than that reported previously; we believe this is due to the limited span of elevation in the setup used previously. By contrast, we tilted the fly head to expose the eyes to a broader vertical visual span. These results show that informed, systematic predictions can guide experimental designs to reveal previously unexplored dimensions of neural functions."
4389,"Discussion: We observed four essential organizational principles of the AVP: a convergence of spatial information from MeTu to TuBu, which suggests the compression of visual information into features with coarse spatial resolution; segregated and parallel processing of spatially overlapping visual features in largely feedforward circuits; parallel pathways for interhemispheric integration, selectively mixing visual features; and divergent feature expansion through TuBu-to-ER connections. Furthermore, by back-tracing from ER neurons to MeTu neurons, we inferred the diverse visual features that compass neurons might use to compute head direction. Our analysis of the reconstructed synaptic pathways reveals that the fly’s visual field can be roughly subdivided into three regions: a narrow band in the dorsal-most visual field; the remaining upper visual field; and the rest of the visual field."
4390,"Of note, the DRA and upper visual fields are occupied by the large majority of MeTu neuron types with overlapping receptive fields; by contrast, the lower and frontal visual fields are served by fewer cells and subtypes. In particular, MeTu4d neurons cover only the ventral half of the visual field. We speculate that this serves to process ventral optic flow or to orient towards shiny surfaces that produce horizontally polarized reflections, which flies detect and use to adjust their body orientation."
4391,"Nine out of the ten parallel information channels formed by MeTu neurons seem to maintain only azimuth information, discarding information about elevation; this strategy seems particularly efficient for computing a heading in azimuth. Only the MeTu3c channel may encode both azimuth and elevation—a property that seems ideal for perceiving the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding environment or for tracking the position of the celestial body throughout the day. Overall, these organizational patterns of the AVP suggest that Drosophila melanogaster prioritizes the azimuthal position of celestial cues, including the skylight polarization pattern. Animals exhibit specific cue preferences during navigation, and we have long known that visual features are processed hierarchically: dung beetles prioritize skylight polarization or sun location depending on the environmental context, and mammals prioritize the geometry of the surrounding space. However, the field is only just beginning to investigate which visual features are extracted and how they are prioritized across insects and mammals."
4392,"As such, our complete reconstruction of the AVP in flies is essential for mechanistically understanding the circuit implementation and shared functional principles that underlie the prioritization, integration, and transformation of this information into a heading signal. This is exemplified by our experiments that physiologically confirm some of the new predictions. Furthermore, with the ability to dissect detailed circuit dynamics of neural populations using the rich genetic tools in flies, we are poised to gain a deeper understanding of how sensory information is transformed into more abstract representations, which is fundamental to and essential for higher cognitive functions in the brain."
4393,"Walking is a complex motor program involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear."
4394,"Here, using connectome-informed models and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning."
4395,"The brake neurons, by contrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioral contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding, and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Walking recruits distributed neural activity across the brain and spinal cord or nerve cord."
4396,"When an animal halts, the net output of this distributed neural activity notably changes to arrest leg stepping movements. Moreover, depending on the behavioral context, animals halt in different context-appropriate ways. Whereas a few specific neuronal types driving halting have been recently described, how walking-related neural activity changes to allow halting in a manner that is both mechanically stable and appropriate to the behavioral context is currently unclear."
4397,"To identify neurons involved in halting in Drosophila, we optogenetically activated specific neurons that innervate the subesophageal zone of the fly brain, a region that houses the neurons close to and including the descending output of the brain. Through this neural activation screen, we identified 11 genetic drivers that were both relatively sparse and caused halting without gross motor deficits. Among these lines, we could unambiguously pinpoint three causal neurons for halting, which we refer to as Foxglove, Bluebell, and Brake."
4398,"We identified split-Gal4 reagents that targeted FG, BB, and BRK with little to no ectopic expression and drove robust halting, as reflected by a decrease in walking velocity, distance, and rotation. Using connectome parsing tools, we identified these neurons in the brain and nerve cord connectomes. Both FG and BB are SEZ neurons that stochastically descend until the anterior tip of the nerve cord."
4399,The FG line has weak ectopic expression in the mushroom body neuropil that does not contribute to the halting phenotype. The BB line also labels an additional neuron previously described as “bluebird.” BRK is a new neuronal type discovered in this work and drives the strongest halting phenotype.
4400,"BRK comprises six ascending neurons with their somata in each of the six leg-segment-specific neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord and axonal projections to the brain SEZ region. By activating subsets of BRK neurons, we found that activating any of the BRK neurons is sufficient to drive halting. Consistent with this, in the connectome, we found that although each BRK receives distinct inputs, all six BRK share common major outputs in their two output zones, the tectulum of the VNC and the SEZ of the brain."
4401,"Analysis of walking velocities on FG, BB, or BRK stimulation hinted at potential differences in the halting phenotypes. To precisely quantify such differences, we performed high-resolution three-dimensional leg kinematics analysis. BRK drove low-latency, long-duration halting bouts with joint angles locked in a specific position for the entire halt duration."
4402,"By contrast, FG and BB induced halts were interspersed with leg movements. FG drove long halting bouts like BRK but still allowed brief repositioning of legs. BB drove stationary periods interspersed with slow walking and allowed more leg movements."
4403,"Unlike BRK, both FG and BB stimulated flies often took a few steps before halting. Defining the genetic drivers and connectome identities of “halt” neurons driving distinct types of halting allowed us to next address their interaction with the walking-promoting circuits. To address if and how the newly identified halt neurons interact with walking-promoting pathways, we leveraged genetic tools targeting walking-promoting neurons characterized in our previous work, namely P9 that drives forward turning, BPN that drives straight forward walking, and MDN that drives backward walking."
4404,"We combined split-Gal4 reagents for the walk and halt neurons and confirmed opsin expression in the desired neurons. Here, in addition to the three halt neuron driver lines, and to confirm the role of BB, we used another driver line that targets FG + BB without any ectopic expression. Using these tools, we performed all possible combinations of “walk + halt” coactivations."
4405,"BRK stimulation completely suppressed all walking commands, suggesting that it drives a dominant halting mechanism. By contrast, FG and BB activation affected the walk neuron phenotypes with varying degrees and specificity, suggesting distinct halting mechanisms being deployed in these cases. During coactivation with MDN, unlike BRK, FG and BB did not suppress backward walking."
4406,"However, the intermittent switches to forward walking observed during continuous MDN stimulation were absent or markedly reduced as seen in the individual trial velocity traces. This suggests that FG and BB predominantly suppress forward walking. Consistent with this, when FG or BB were coactivated with P9, the flies showed a marked reduction in forward velocity."
4407,"BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 coactivated flies also showed a corresponding decrease in angular velocity compared to P9-stimulated flies. However, FG + P9 coactivated flies still showed a large increase in angular velocity at stimulation onset. We found that while the BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 flies were predominantly halting during the optogenetic stimulation, FG + P9 flies were pivoting on the spot."
4408,"These observations revealed an unexpected modularity in the P9 downstream pathway into two components: a forward walking component that is suppressed by both FG and BB, and a turning component that is suppressed by BB. As the FG + BB line has a similar phenotype as the BB line, we conclude that BB, and not bluebird, is responsible for the forward turning suppression. When FG or BB was coactivated with BPN, the flies still increased forward walking during optogenetic stimulation."
4409,"Whereas this increase in forward walking tended to be smaller than that of activation of BPN alone, only in the case of FG could we see a statistically significant difference in the distance quantification. Although BPN + FG + BB coactivated flies decreased forward walking, it was interspersed with intermittent jumps, possibly due to ectopic expression in the VNC, rendering the distance quantification unreliable. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FG can partially suppress the BPN-driven forward walking."
4410,"To summarize, we found that BRK suppresses all walking commands, FG specifically suppresses the forward walking components of P9 and BPN, and BB predominantly suppresses forward turning induced by P9. The diversity in these walk-halt interactions suggests that the neural targets and mechanisms deployed by the three halting pathways are at least partially distinct. Guided by the whole fly brain connectome and the FlyWire toolkit, we asked if and where the halting and walking pathways might converge."
4411,"We identified, annotated, and proofread all the walk and halt neuronal types and their downstream partners in the connectome. We found no direct connections between the walk and halt neurons. However, all the walk and halt neurons share a common output zone, the SEZ, where they could converge on the same output neurons."
4412,"Even though MDN and P9 are descending neurons that project from the brain to the VNC, they have collaterals in the SEZ through which they recruit other neurons, including DNs. Decapitated MDN flies, in which these SEZ collaterals are eliminated, show backward walking on optogenetic stimulation, indicating that the VNC circuit recruited by MDNs is sufficient for driving the phenotype. However, decapitated P9-activated flies do not show the phenotypic forward turning."
4413,"This implies that the other DNs recruited by P9 SEZ collaterals are critical for the phenotype. Indeed, some P9 downstream DNs were previously implicated in turning. BPN is a higher brain neuron that directly recruits other DNs through SEZ outputs."
4414,"We therefore focused on identifying whether halting pathway projections to the SEZ impinge on DNs recruited by P9 and BPN. To comprehensively analyze the interaction between halting and walking pathways, we used a connectome-constrained whole-brain spiking-network model to reproduce the behavioral coactivation experiments in silico. The model uses the entire connectivity matrix from the FlyWire data and assigns positive or negative weight to the connection based on synapse number and predicted neurotransmitter."
4415,"We validated the neurotransmitter predictions for the halt neurons and confirmed that FG and BB are γ-aminobutyric acidergic neurons, whereas BRK is an excitatory neuronal type. Comparing responses across the top 100 responding neurons in each in silico coactivation experiment shows that all three halt neurons inhibit different, partially overlapping subsets of neurons recruited by the walk pathways. Although the P9 pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by BB, the BPN pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by FG."
4416,"This aligns with the corresponding behavioral phenotypes. We next focused on DNs strongly recruited by the walk pathways and generated synapse-weighted graphs to simultaneously visualize the connectivity and predicted firing rate. In the case of P9 coactivation with halt neurons, BB suppressed the firing rate of most of the DNs, whereas FG specifically inhibited a single DN named oDN1."
4417,"The BB result is consistent with the complete suppression of the P9 phenotype in behavioral experiments. Given that FG only suppressed the forward walking component of the P9 phenotype, we infer that oDN1 is mainly relevant for driving forward velocity but not rotational velocity. In the case of DNs recruited by BPN, neither FG nor BB inhibits the whole population."
4418,"This could explain why we never saw a complete suppression of walking in the corresponding behavioral experiments. To probe why FG has a stronger effect in behavioral experiments, we compared the neurons that are differentially affected by FG versus BB. BDN2 stood apart as a DN specifically and strongly inhibited by FG."
4419,"Taken together, the modeling and behavioral data show that FG and BB are positioned to directly inhibit critical nodes in the P9 and BPN walking-promotion pathways and decrease forward and/or rotational walking velocity. We term this the walk-OFF mechanism. Furthermore, oDN1 and BDN2 stood apart as important nodes to mediate differences in BB and FG effects on the walking pathways."
4420,"We therefore generated split-Gal4 drivers to specifically target these neurons. Optogenetically activating oDN1 and BDN2 drove walking initiation, with BDN2 showing a much stronger phenotype. Even decapitated, oDN1 and BDN2 activated flies initiated robust forward walking, suggesting that, unlike P9, the VNC outputs of these DNs are sufficient for forward walking."
4421,"However, on optogenetic silencing, only BDN2-silenced flies showed a reduction in forward velocity. This suggests that BDN2 might be critical during spontaneous walking, whereas oDN1 could be redundant or recruited only in specific contexts. Indeed, on in vivo imaging, we found that BDN2 activity is strongly correlated to the forward velocity of the fly."
4422,"Given that BDN2 is strongly inhibited by FG and not by BB, this could explain why FG drives stronger halting in spontaneously walking flies. In silico coactivating BRK ascending projections, along with P9 and BPN, showed that while BRK is excitatory, it recruits other predicted inhibitory neurons in the SEZ to suppress walking-promotion DNs. When coactivated with P9, BRK inhibits many of the critical walking-promotion DNs, including oDN1."
4423,"However, when coactivated with BPN, BRK inhibits only a subset of DNs, with BDN2 being weakly inhibited. This is in contrast to the strong walking suppression observed in the corresponding behavioral experiments. Crucially, BRK activation suppressed backward walking driven by MDN, whose descending output in the VNC is sufficient to drive backward walking."
4424,"This suggests that, in addition to inhibiting some walking-promoting pathways in the brain, BRK probably acts in the VNC to drive halting. The ""brake"" mechanism: The stepping cycle consists of a swing phase and stance phase. Given the strong ""freezing-like"" BRK phenotype, we wondered whether BRK could cause the legs to ""freeze"" at any point during a stepping cycle, similar to a recent report in mice."
4425,"We found that in the case of BRK mid-swing stimulation, the leg finishes the swing phase in an unaltered manner but freezes as soon as it lands on the ground when the femur-tibia joint is in an extended position. Indeed, in these cases, swing duration is not altered when compared to prestimulus swing duration. However, for BRK mid-stance stimulation, the leg stays locked in place at the onset of the stimulation, leading to a broad Fe-Ti joint distribution across flies and trials."
4426,"This is in contrast to FG stimulation, in which the leg always assumes a relaxed stance position, regardless of when the optogenetic stimulus started. A similar result was obtained for other leg joints, suggesting it is not a Fe–Ti joint-specific phenomenon. This locking of joints during the stance phase shows that the BRK phenotype is probably due to an active mechanism."
4427,"We proposed that this could be driven by BRK VNC outputs upregulating the postural resistance reflex to lock the leg joints. The term ""resistance reflex"" is used to describe postural reflexes in all legged animals that allow for the maintenance of posture while in a stationary state. Upregulating such reflexes could lead to the locking of leg joints during the stance phase, as seen on BRK stimulation."
4428,"To test this hypothesis, we activated either MDN or MDN + BRK in decapitated flies and analyzed their leg kinematics. As reported earlier, decapitated flies showed backward walking on MDN activation. However, decapitated MDN + BRK stimulated flies remained stationary."
4429,"This confirms that a VNC-specific circuit is recruited by BRK to arrest leg movements. During backward walking, the Fe–Ti joint of the front leg is extended before a swing is initiated. We, therefore, refer to Fe–Ti angles above 107° as the ""swing initiation zone."""
4430,"On MDN + BRK stimulation, the Fe–Ti angle remained locked in place, and in most cases, it never reached the SIZ. In the few cases when it reached the SIZ, this rarely led to elevation of the leg. The leg, despite being in an extended Fe–Ti position, still remained firmly perched on the substrate, as indicated by increased dwell time in the SIZ and decreased swing events in the SIZ."
4431,"We performed a complementary analysis for forward walking while activating BDN2 or BDN2 + BRK in decapitated flies. In contrast to backward walking, during forward walking, the SIZ for front-leg Fe–Ti lies in flexed angle values. Despite this difference, coactivation with BRK interrupted forward walking in a similar manner to that seen for backward walking."
4432,"Taken together, this showed that BRK activation led the flies to resist both flexion and extension at the Fe–Ti joint. Resisting such movements would require actively engaging specific leg muscles. We, therefore, activated BRK and monitored front-leg femoral muscle activity with the Fe–Ti joint restrained in a flexed or extended position."
4433,"In a flexed Fe–Ti position, activating BRK recruited accessory flexor-a and extensor. However, in an extended Fe–Ti position, BRK stimulation recruited accessory flexor-a and accessory flexor-b. Based on the literature, we inferred that accessory flexor-a corresponds to the muscles innervated by slow motor neurons and is also implicated in maintaining joint position."
4434,"The position of accessory flexor-b indicates they are probably innervated by intermediate and/or fast flexor motor neurons that drive flexion movement, which would resist forced extension. Extensors, on the other hand, drive Fe–Ti extension and would therefore resist forced flexion. Thus, the muscle activity profile driven by BRK resembles a resistance-like state in each Fe–Ti position."
4435,"Even in cases when there was spontaneous, prestimulus muscle activity, BRK drove a concerted change, including inhibition of highly active muscles and activation of specific muscles to reach this same resistance state-like activity profile. To confirm this represents a resistance reflex-like activity, we passively flexed or extended the Fe–Ti joint and induced a resistance reflex while monitoring muscle activity. Here, both control flies and BRK stimulated flies resisted these passive movements and showed a similar recruitment of muscles to that described above, with BRK stimulated flies showing a more robust response."
4436,"Taken together, this suggests that BRK drives a resistance-like state in the femoral muscles. FG or BB activation did not induce any robust muscle activity in similar experiments. Only in cases where there was prestimulus spontaneous muscle activity did FG lead to gradual inhibition of this activity."
4437,"We reasoned this could be because FG inhibits DNs driving the prestimulus spontaneous activity. Combining the kinematics and muscle imaging results, we conclude that BRK drives a stance phase-specific resistance state at the leg joints by means of a VNC-specific neural circuit. FG and BB are required during foraging. We next addressed if and when the animals use the FG, BB, and BRK halting pathways."
4438,"Mining the connectome for inputs to the halting neurons revealed that FG and BB are downstream of the sugar sensory pathway and directly connected to Fdg neurons previously shown to drive halting and proboscis extension for feeding. We therefore activated sugar gustatory receptor neurons both in silico and in vivo. In both cases, FG was strongly recruited, whereas BB showed weak and variable activity."
4439,"Moreover, in vivo, FG showed stronger responses in starved flies compared to fed flies, whereas BB only responded in starved flies. These state-dependent responses could be driven by differences in the feeding drive due to hunger signals affecting the sugar sensory pathway."
4440,"To understand how different feeding and walking drives might converge on the previously implicated walking-promotion nodes, we coactivated sugar GRNs with either P9 or BPN walk neurons at varying activity levels and monitored oDN1 and BDN2 firing rates, respectively. Both oDN1 and BDN2 were tightly regulated as a function of walking and feeding pathway stimulation, showing that there is an excitation–inhibition balance at these nodes. To test whether FG is critical for relaying the inhibition from sugar GRNs to the walking nodes, we repeated the above simulation while silencing FG in the model."
4441,"This clearly shifted the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking nodes, such that we could now see the release of inhibition on oDN1 and BDN2 compared to the results in the FG intact model. This suggests that FG may be relevant for halting in the context of foraging and feeding. Because BB is only weakly recruited in our model, we did not see significant changes at BDN2 or oDN1 when we repeated the simulation with BB silenced."
4442,"To confirm the role of halt neurons during feeding, we optogenetically silenced these neurons while providing starved flies with a choice between blank substrate versus sucrose substrate. Control flies or flies with BRK or BB silenced spent most of their time on the sucrose side, whereas FG silenced flies were unable to preferentially stay on the sucrose side, confirming the importance of FG for stopping on sugar detection. At the start of this assay, flies were randomly distributed on the sucrose and blank side, making it difficult to analyze locomotor changes when the fly first encountered the sucrose."
4443,"To analyze these first encounters, we quantified interaction of flies with a small food blob placed at the center of a large circular arena. All flies slowed down when they first encountered the food blob, probably because, unlike the previous assay, here they could detect the food blob by textural changes and consume it. However, FG- and BB-silenced flies showed shorter stopping bouts and increased velocities near the blob compared to controls."
4444,"Specifically, BB-silenced flies were indistinguishable from controls before food encounter but showed prolonged increases in both translational and angular velocities after the food encounter. This could indicate a potential role for BB in constraining forward and angular velocities during foraging-type behaviors that involve a local search following a food encounter. Such post-food-encounter behavioral state transitions have been well described in flies."
4445,"However, these are not accounted for in our computational model or in the functional imaging experiments. This could explain the weaker BB responses observed in vivo or in silico during sugar GRN stimulation. Taken together, this confirms that FG and BB are recruited for halting and locomotor control in the context of feeding and foraging."
4446,"Notably, connectomics revealed that this halting pathway diverges from the previously described proboscis extension pathway. In agreement with this, FG or BB silencing had no effect on the proboscis extension response when tethered flies were presented with sucrose. BRK is required during grooming. To understand when flies recruit BRK neurons, we monitored in vivo BRK activity in spontaneous walking and halting flies."
4447,"We imaged a region of the VNC that permits identification of the axons belonging to each of the six BRK neurons. We noticed that BRK is recruited only during a subset of halting events. By annotating synchronously recorded behavior, we found that BRK activity correlated with either ""ball-pushing"" or ""grooming"" events."
4448,"As ball-pushing is probably a special behavior that only happens in a tethered fly walking on an air-supported ball, we focused on the grooming events. BRK activity correlated in a segment-specific manner with the respective grooming events. Most prominent among these were front-leg rubs and hind-leg rubs that coincided with large correlated activity bumps in front and hind BRK, respectively."
4449,"Aligning the BRK activity profile across multiple flies and grooming events showed that the segment-specific BRK activity starts ramping up before the grooming event and is synchronized with a coincident dip in walking velocity. Fittingly, in the connectome, we found that DNg12, a command neuron that drives head grooming with front legs, provides most input to front BRK, whereas wPN1, a command neuron that drives wing grooming with hind legs, provides most input to hind BRK. We also identified potential leg-grooming sensory-motor pathways from each leg to the corresponding segment BRK neurons."
4450,"Thus, BRK neurons receive distinct segment-specific grooming command inputs. However, all BRK neurons share common outputs that lead to halting with upregulation of postural reflexes. What could be the role of the BRK outputs during grooming?"
4451,"During grooming, flies halt and lift a subset of legs while supporting their body weight on the remaining stationary legs. We wondered whether BRK was necessary for both halting and stability during grooming. We, therefore, optogenetically silenced BRK in flies that were induced to groom by powdering them."
4452,"BRK silencing did not abolish grooming but led to interruption of continuous grooming by intermittent walking events, confirming BRK’s role for halting during grooming. Control flies or flies with FG or BB silenced showed prolonged uninterrupted grooming. Moreover, we found that BRK-silenced flies became destabilized during grooming."
4453,"To address whether this destabilization was due to the VNC outputs of BRK, we repeated this experiment in decapitated flies. Consistent with the literature, control decapitated flies showed robust grooming when covered with powder. Because decapitated flies do not have an inherent forward walking drive like intact flies, it was unsurprising that we did not see any walking upon BRK silencing."
4454,"However, we saw that powdered, decapitated BRK-silenced flies often lost their balance and tripped while grooming, confirming BRK’s role in stabilization during grooming. Based on the above observations, and given that BRK output only affects legs in stance, we proposed that BRK is recruited by segment-specific grooming commands to halt and stabilize the posture of the stationary legs used for balancing the body weight. For instance, during front grooming, command neurons would recruit the front BRKs that in turn stabilize the mid and hind legs, whereas, during hind grooming, the corresponding grooming commands would recruit hind-BRKs that in turn stabilize the front and mid legs."
4455,"To test this segment-specific role of BRK, we designed an assay in which we silenced BRK subsets while inducing segment-specific grooming. We generated split-Gal4 lines that targeted front BRK, front + mid-BRK, or front + hind BRK, and confirmed that activating these BRK subsets drives halting in all cases. Next, we optogenetically silenced these BRK subsets and induced front or hind grooming using a powdered brush in tethered decapitated flies placed on an air-supported ball."
4456,"We performed a leg kinematics analysis of the front and hind legs. As expected, control flies were stable during the grooming events, as indicated by low ball movement and low Fe–Ti movement of the non-grooming legs. Conversely, when front-BRK silenced flies were induced to perform front grooming, they were destabilized, as shown by increased ball movement and hind-leg movements."
4457,"However, if flies with silenced front BRK but intact hind BRK were induced to perform hind grooming, they showed control-like behavior and groomed hind legs while stabilizing the front legs. On the other hand, flies with hind BRK silenced were destabilized during hind grooming bouts. Taken together, this shows that BRK is recruited in a segment-specific manner for halting and stability in the context of grooming."
4458,"We thus explain distinct contexts in which each halting pathway is recruited. Consistent with this, activating head-bristle sensory projections in the brain connectome model drove strong activity in DNg12s but not in FG or BB, whereas activating sugar GRNs recruited FG and BB but not DNg12s. Having identified the critical nodes in the walking pathways that are targeted by halt neurons, we aimed to gain insight into other halting pathways that could be relevant in other contexts."
4459,"Although we could not identify some previously described slowing or halting neurons in the connectome, we could locate two neurons that were implicated indirectly in promoting halting, namely MAN and oviDN. In similar simulations as in Fig. 3, both MAN and oviDN, through predicted GABAergic neurons, suppressed walking-promotion neurons including oDN1 and BDN2."
4460,"This showed other routes in addition to FG, BB, and BRK that could inhibit walking-promotion nodes. To find all such routes, we generated a list of predicted halt neurons as those with strong inhibitory inputs to oDN1 and BDN2, most of which also inhibit other potential walking-promotion DNs. As these neurons will ultimately control the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking-promotion nodes, these could also be involved in velocity control and not just halting."
4461,"These predicted halt neurons receive input from different upstream neurons and could underlie halting in other behavioral contexts. Our work explains two fundamental halting mechanisms in Drosophila. The first mechanism, categorized as the walk-OFF mechanism, causes halting by inhibition of walking-promotion neurons."
4462,"This could be compared to taking one’s foot off the gas pedal of a car and is analogous to action-suppression mechanisms proposed in different behaviors, including walking, across organisms. In this connectomics-driven work, we could go beyond identification of this mechanism and gain major insights into the organization of the halting and walking-control circuits in flies. We found that walking initiation neurons recruit populations of heterogeneous DNs by means of SEZ outputs that are poised to recruit multiple downstream VNC circuits for initiating specific walking patterns; halting and walking pathways converge at specific nodes in these DN populations, whose excitation–inhibition balance probably dictates the walking state, and different halting pathways inhibit different subsets of walking-promotion DNs."
4463,"Specifically, turning and forward-walking-promoting DNs could be differentially inhibited by BB and FG, respectively. This shows a modularity in the descending control of turning and forward walking that is consistent with recent results from neuronal population imaging and modeling work in Drosophila. This also aligns with modularity at the level of brainstem spinal projection neurons observed in vertebrates, indicating that vertebrates could also have halting pathways that differentially inhibit forward locomotion and turning."
4464,"The second mechanism, categorized as the brake mechanism, drives active resistance at the leg joints in the legs that are on the ground, much like the brakes of a car resisting the motion of the wheels. Also, similarly to how one releases the accelerator pedal while pressing on the brakes to avoid skidding, the newly identified BRK neurons inhibit the walking-promotion DNs through their brain outputs while simultaneously promoting resistance in the legs through their VNC outputs. The pathway from BRK to leg muscles is probably gated by proprioceptive inputs that confer the stance phase-specific behavioral response."
4465,This BRK mechanism is consistent with their recruitment during grooming when the fly needs to both inhibit walking and balance its body on a subset of stationary legs. A similar mechanism could be relevant in other halting contexts in flies or other animals for execution of halting with increased stability. Recent work in mice has uncovered a brainstem neuronal population that drives halting with legs in stance.
4466,"However, these neurons were not shown to drive upregulation of postural reflexes as seen for BRK. Moreover, recent work shows subsets of Chx10-Gi neurons being relevant in different aspects of walking, stopping, turning, or grooming. Our results encourage the search for BRK-like mechanisms in these Chx10-Gi subsets or other BRK-analogous spinal ascending pathways in vertebrates."
4467,"Comparing across connectome-informed circuits of all verified or predicted halting pathways in this study, we isolated a generic neural circuit motif for halting. To promote halting and allow stationary behaviors such as feeding, egg-laying, or grooming, the halting pathway branches off from the behavior-specific sensory-motor pathway and impinges on walking-promoting circuits. The halt neurons themselves need not encode for the behavior-specific motor output but rather drive the initiation and maintenance of a halted state during the behavior."
4468,"This halting branch is typically located downstream to command-like neurons in the sensory-motor circuit. This emergence of modularity downstream in the circuit could be an efficient circuit design for targeting a similar population of walking-promotion neurons in different contexts. Despite this conserved motif shared across all halting pathways, the specific targets and mechanisms deployed by the halt neurons are distinct."
4469,"This distinction may confer the specificity to how halting versus walking decisions are executed in a context-appropriate manner. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic, and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types, and developmental units."
4470,"Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes."
4471,"Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics. The adult fruit fly represents the current frontier for whole-brain connectomics."
4472,"With 139,255 neurons, the newly completed full adult female brain connectome is intermediate in log scale between the first connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse, a desirable but currently intractable target. The availability of a complete adult fly brain connectome now allows brain-spanning circuits to be mapped and linked to circuit dynamics and behavior, as has long been possible for the nematode and more recently for the Drosophila larva. However, the adult fly has richer behavior, including complex motor control while walking or in flight, courtship behavior, involved decision-making, flexible associative memory, spatial learning, and complex multisensory navigation."
4473,"The FlyWire brain connectome reported in our companion paper is by some margin the largest and most complex yet obtained. The full connectome, derived from the approximately 100 teravoxel FAFB whole-brain electron microscopy volume, can be represented as a graph with 139,255 nodes and around 15.1 million weighted edges."
4474,"Here we formulate and answer key questions that are essential to interpreting connectomes at this scale regarding how we know which edges are important; how we can simplify the connectome graph to aid automated or human analysis; and the extent to which this connectome is a snapshot of a single brain or representative of this species as a whole. These questions are inextricably linked with connectome annotation and cell type identification within and across datasets. At the most basic level, navigating this connectome would be extremely challenging without a comprehensive system of annotations, which we now provide."
4475,"Our annotations represent an indexed and hierarchical human-readable parts list, enabling biologists to explore their systems and neurons of interest. Connectome annotation is also crucial to ensuring data quality as it inevitably reveals segmentation errors that must be corrected. Furthermore, there is a rich history in Drosophila of probing the circuit basis of a wide range of innate and learned behaviors as well as their developmental genetic origins; realizing the full potential of this dataset is only possible by cross-identifying cell types within the connectome with those characterized in the published and in-progress literature."
4476,"This paper reports on this key component of the connectome together with the open-source tools and resources that we have generated. As the annotation and proofreading of the connectome are inextricably linked, the companion paper and this paper will preferably be co-cited as they jointly describe the FlyWire resource. Comparison with cell types proposed using the partial hemibrain connectome confirmed that the majority of fly cell types are highly stereotyped and defined simple rules for which connections within a connectome are reliable and therefore more likely to be functional."
4477,"However, this comparison also revealed unexpected variability in some cell types and demonstrated that many cell types originally reported in the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. This discovery necessitated the development and application of a new robust approach for defining cell types jointly across connectomics datasets. Overall, this effort lays the foundation both for deep interrogation of current and anticipated fly connectomes from normal individuals and for future studies of sexual dimorphism, experience-dependent plasticity, development, and disease at the whole-brain scale."
4478,"Hierarchical annotation of a connectome: Annotations defining different kinds of neurons are key to exploring and interpreting any connectome; but with the FlyWire connectome— which we report jointly with the companion paper—now exceeding the 100,000 neuron mark, they are also of increased significance and more challenging to generate. We defined a comprehensive, systematic, and hierarchical set of annotations based on the anatomical organization of the brain, as well as the developmental origin and coarse morphology of neurons. Building on these and validating cell types identified from pre-existing datasets, we then defined a set of consensus terminal cell types intended to capture the finest level of organization that is reproducible across brains."
4479,"We first collected and curated basic metadata for every neuron in the dataset, including soma position and side, and entry or exit nerve for afferent and efferent neurons, respectively. Our group also predicted neurotransmitter identity for all neurons as reported elsewhere. We then defined a hierarchy of four levels: flow > superclass > class > cell type, which provides salient labels at different granularities."
4480,"The first two levels, flow and superclass, were densely annotated: every neuron is either afferent, efferent, or intrinsic to the brain and falls into one of the nine superclasses: sensory, motor, endocrine, ascending (to brain), descending, visual projection, visual centrifugal, or intrinsic to the optic lobes or the central brain. Mapping to the virtual fly brain database enables cross-referencing of neurons and types with other publications."
4481,"Note that due to an inversion of the left–right axis during the original acquisition of the FAFB dataset, identified during the preparation of this work, frontal figures in this work and the FlyWire connectome have the fly’s left on the viewer’s left, and the fly’s right on the viewer’s right; that is, the opposite of the usual convention. However, all side labels are biologically correct. The class field contains pre-existing neurobiological groupings from the literature and is sparsely annotated for the central brain, in large part because past research has favored some brain areas over others."
4482,"In the optic lobes, 99% of neurons have a generic class based on their neuropil innervation. Finally, 98% of all central brain neurons were given a terminal cell type, a majority of which could be linked to at least one report in the literature. Our annotations for the optic lobes include cell types for 92% of neurons in both left and right optic lobes."
4483,"A separate report will describe comprehensive typing of all neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes. In total, we collected over 870,000 annotations for all 139,255 neurons; all are available for download and through neuroglancer scenes. A total of 32,388 neurons are intrinsic to the central brain, and 77,536 neurons are intrinsic to the optic lobes."
4484,"The optic lobes and the central brain are connected through 8,053 visual projection and 524 visual centrifugal neurons. The central brain receives afferent input through 5,512 sensory and 2,362 ascending neurons. Efferent output is realized through 1,303 descending, 80 endocrine, and 106 motor neurons."
4485,"We find marked stereotypy in the number of central brain intrinsic neurons—for example, between the left and the right hemisphere, they differ by only 27 neurons. For superclasses with less consistency in left versus right counts, such as the ascending neurons, the discrepancies are typically due to ambiguity in the sidedness. Combining the dense superclass annotation for all neurons with the connectome gives a bird’s-eye view of the input/output connectivity of the central brain: 55% of the central brain’s synaptic input comes from the optic system; 25% from the VNC through ascending neurons; and only 18% from peripheral sensory neurons."
4486,"This is surprising as sensory neurons are almost as numerous as visual projection neurons; individual visual projection neurons therefore provide about 2.5 times more synapses, underscoring the value of this information stream. Input neurons make about two synapses onto central brain neurons for every one synapse onto output neurons."
4487,"Most output synapses target the VNC through descending neurons; the rest provide centrifugal feedback onto the optic system, motor neuron output, and endocrine output to the periphery. A full atlas of neuronal lineages is provided by our top-level annotations, which offer a systematic but relatively coarse grouping of neurons compared with over 5,000 terminal cell types expected from previous work on the hemibrain. We therefore developed an intermediate level of annotation based on hemilineages—this provides a powerful bridge between the developmental origin and molecular specification of neurons and their place within circuits in the connectome."
4488,"Central brain neurons and a minority of visual projection neurons are generated by around 120 identified neuroblasts per hemisphere. Each of these stem cells is defined by a unique transcriptional code and generates a stereotyped lineage in a precise birth order by asymmetric division. Each neuroblast typically produces two hemilineages that differ markedly in neuronal morphology and can express different neurotransmitters from one another, but neurons in each hemilineage usually express a single fast-acting transmitter."
4489,"Hemilineages therefore represent a natural functional as well as developmental grouping by which to study the nervous system. Within a hemilineage, neurons form processes that extend together in one cohesive bundle that enters, traverses, and interconnects neuropil compartments in a stereotypical pattern. Comparing these features between EM and previous light-level data enabled us to compile the first definitive atlas of all hemilineages in the central brain."
4490,"In total, we successfully identified 120 neuroblast lineages in FlyWire comprising 183 hemilineages for 88% of central brain neurons. The unassigned neurons are likely primary neurons born during embryonic development, which account for 10% of neurons in the adult brain. We tentatively designated 3,779 as primary neurons, either based on specific identification in the literature or expert assessment of diagnostic morphological features such as larger cell bodies and broader projections."
4491,"A further 797 neurons did not co-fasciculate with any hemilineage tracts, even though their morphology suggested that they are later-born secondary neurons. This developmental atlas is comprehensive as, after reviewing discrepancies between previous studies, we identified all 119 expected lineages plus one new lineage. The number of neurons per hemilineage can vary widely—for example, counting both hemispheres, FLAa1 contains just 30 neurons, whereas MBp4 has 1,335."
4492,"However, in general, the number of neurons per hemilineage is between 60 and 282. Nevertheless, the numbers of neurons within each hemilineage were highly reliable, differing only by 3% between the left and right hemispheres. This is consistent with the near equality of neurons per hemisphere noted in the figure and indicates great precision in the developmental programs controlling neuron number. We also identified neurons belonging to 125 hemilineages in the hemibrain dataset, a connectome comprising approximately half of a female fly brain. The number of neurons per hemilineage strongly correlates across brains, with FlyWire hemilineages containing on average around 5% more neurons."
4493,"Although hemilineages typically contain functionally and morphologically related neurons, subgroups can be observed. We further divided each hemilineage into distinct morphology groups, each innervating similar brain regions and taking similar internal tracts, using NBLAST morphological clustering. This generated a total of 528 groupings that are consistent across hemispheres and provide an additional layer of annotations between the hemilineage and cell type levels."
4494,"Validating cell types across brains, we next sought to compare FlyWire against the hemibrain connectome; this contains most of one central brain hemisphere and parts of the optic lobe. The hemibrain was previously densely cell typed by a combination of two automated procedures followed by extensive manual review: NBLAST morphology clustering initially yielded 5,235 morphology types; multiple rounds of CBLAST connectivity clustering split some types, generating 640 connectivity types for a final total of 5,620 types. We have reidentified just 14% of connectivity types and therefore use the 5,235 morphology types as a baseline for comparison."
4495,"Although 389 of the hemibrain cell types were previously established in the literature and recorded in the database, principally through the analysis of genetic driver lines, the great majority were newly proposed using the hemibrain, that is, derived from a single hemisphere of a single animal. This was reasonable given the pioneering nature of the hemibrain reconstruction, but the availability of the FlyWire connectome now allows for a more stringent re-examination."
4496,"We approach this by considering each cell type in the hemibrain as a prediction: if we can reidentify a distinct group of cells with the same properties in both hemispheres of the FlyWire dataset, then we conclude that a proposed hemibrain cell type has been tested and validated. To perform this validation, we first used non-rigid three-dimensional registration to map meshes and skeletons of all hemibrain neurons into FlyWire space, enabling direct co-visualization of both datasets and a range of automated analyses. We then used NBLAST to calculate morphological similarity scores between all hemibrain neurons and the approximately 84,000 FlyWire neurons with arbors at least partially contained within the hemibrain volume."
4497,"We manually reviewed the top five NBLAST hits for a random sample of individual neuron-to-neuron matches and found that high NBLAST scores typically indicate a good morphological match. Extrapolating from this sample, we expect 99% of hemibrain neurons to have a morphologically very similar neuron in FlyWire. We next attempted to map hemibrain cell types onto FlyWire neurons."
4498,"Candidate type matches were manually reviewed by co-visualization, and only those with high confidence were accepted. Crucially, this initial morphological matching process generated a large corpus of shared cell type labels between datasets; with these in place, we developed an across-dataset connectivity clustering method that enabled us to investigate and resolve difficult cases. The majority of hemibrain cell types were unambiguously found in the FlyWire dataset."
4499,"A further 664 hemibrain types were mapped but had to be either merged or further split. In total, 7% of proposed hemibrain types were combined to define new ‘composite’ types because the hemibrain split could not be recapitulated when examining neurons from both FlyWire and the hemibrain. This is not too surprising as the hemibrain philosophy was explicitly to err on the side of splitting in cases of uncertainty."
4500,"We found that 5% of proposed hemibrain types needed to be split, for example, because truncation of neurons in the hemibrain removed a key defining feature. Together, these revisions mean that the 3,584 reidentified hemibrain cell types map onto 3,643 consensus cell types. All revisions were confirmed by across-dataset connectivity clustering."
4501,"Notably, 1,651 hemibrain cell types could not be reidentified in FlyWire. Ambiguities due to hemibrain truncation can partially explain this: we were much more successful at matching neurons that were not truncated in the hemibrain. However, this appears not to be the main explanation."
4502,"Especially in cases of multiple, very similar, ‘adjacent’ hemibrain types, we often encountered ‘chains’ of ambiguity that made assigning types difficult. Further investigation suggests that the majority of these unmatched hemibrain types are not exactly replicable across animals. Instead, we show that multiconnectome analysis can generate validated cell types that are robust to interindividual variation."
4503,"In conclusion, we validated 3,643 high-confidence consensus cell type labels for 43,737 neurons from three different hemispheres and two different brains. Collectively, these cross-matched neurons cover 46.5% of central brain edges in the FlyWire graph."
4504,"This body of high-confidence cross-identified neurons enables both within-brain and across-brain comparisons. Cell types are highly stereotyped. Using the consensus cell type labels, we found that the numbers of cells per type across the three hemispheres are closely correlated. About one in six cell types shows a difference in numbers between the left and right hemispheres, and one in three across brains."
4505,"The mean difference in the number of cells per type is small, though: 0.3 within brains and 0.8 across brains."
4506,"Importantly, cell types with fewer neurons per type are less variable. At the extreme, ""singleton"" cell types account for 59% of all types in our sample; they often appear to be embryonic-born or early secondary neurons and only very rarely comprise more than one neuron—only 3% of neurons that are singletons in both FlyWire hemispheres have more than one member in the hemibrain. By contrast, more numerous cell types are also more likely to vary in number both within and even more so across brains."
4507,"Synapse counts were also largely consistent within cell types, both within and across brains. To enable a fair comparison, the FlyWire synapse cloud was restricted to the smaller hemibrain volume. Although this does not correct for other potential confounds such as differences in the synaptic completion rates or synapse detection, pre- and post-synapse counts per cell type were highly correlated, both within and across brains."
4508,"This is an important quality control and prerequisite for subsequent connectivity comparisons. The fly brain is mostly left–right symmetric, but inspection of the FlyWire dataset revealed a small number of asymmetries. For example, LC6 and LC9 visual projection neurons form a large axon bundle that follows the normal path in the right hemisphere but, in the left hemisphere, it loops over the mushroom body peduncle; nevertheless, the axons still find their correct targets."
4509,We annotated other examples of this ranging from small additional/missing branches to misguided neurite bundles and found that only 0.4% of central brain neurons exhibit such biological oddities. Brain wiring develops through a complex and probabilistic developmental process.
4510,"To interpret the connectome, it is vital to obtain a basic understanding of how variable that biological process is. This is complicated by the fact that the connectome we observe is shaped not just by biological variability but also by technical noise, for example, from segmentation issues, synapse detection errors, and synaptic completion rates. Here, we use the consensus cell types to assess which connections are reliably observed across three hemispheres of connectome data."
4511,"We use the term ""edge"" to describe the set of connections between two cell types, and its ""weight"" as the number of unitary synapses forming that connection. Weights of individual edges are highly correlated within and across brains. Consistent with this, cell types exhibit highly similar connectivity within as well as across brains."
4512,"While the connectivity similarity across brains is lower than within brains, the effect size is small and is at least in part due to the aforementioned truncation in the hemibrain. We next examined, for a given edge between two cell types in one hemisphere, the odds of finding the same connection in another hemisphere or brain. Examination of 572,980 edges present in at least one of the three brain hemispheres showed that 53% of the edges observed in the hemibrain were also found in FlyWire."
4513,"This fraction is slightly higher when comparing between the two FlyWire hemispheres: left to right: 61%; right to left: 59%. Weaker edges were less likely to be consistent: an edge consisting of a single synapse in the hemibrain has a 42% chance of also being present in a single FlyWire hemisphere, and only a 16% chance of being seen in both hemispheres of FlyWire. By contrast, any edge of more than ten synapses in any hemisphere can be reproducibly found in the other two hemispheres."
4514,"Although only 16% of all edges meet this threshold, they comprise around 79% of all synapses. We also analyzed normalized edge weights expressed as the fraction of the input onto each downstream neuron; this accounts for the small difference in synaptic completion rate between FlyWire and the hemibrain. With this treatment, the distributions are almost identical for within- and across-brain comparisons."
4515,"9% of the target cell type’s total inputs have a greater than 90% chance of persisting. Around 7% of edges, collectively containing over half of all synapses, meet this threshold. We observed that the fraction of edges persisting across datasets plateaued as the edge weight increased."
4516,"Using a level of 99% edge persistence, we can define a second principled heuristic: edges greater than 2.6% edge weight can be considered strong. Note that these statistics defined across the whole connectome can have exceptions in individual neurons."
4517,"For example, the descending neuron DNp42 receives 34 synapses from PLP146 in FlyWire on the right, but none on the left or in the hemibrain; this may well be an example of developmental noise. So far, we have examined only the binary question of whether an edge exists or not. However, the conservation of edge weight is also highly relevant for interpreting connectomes."
4518,"We next considered, given that an edge is present in two or more hemispheres, the odds that it will have a similar weight. Edge weights within and across brains are highly correlated; a 30-synapse edge in the hemibrain, for example, will on average consist of 29 synapses in FlyWire, despite differences in synaptic detection and completion rates for these two datasets imaged with different EM modalities. The variance of edge weights is considerable, though: 25% of all 30-synapse hemibrain edges will consist of fewer than 13 synapses in FlyWire, and 5% will consist of only 1–2 synapses."
4519,"Consistency is greater when looking within FlyWire: a 30-synapse edge on the left will, on average, consist of 31 synapses on the right. Still, 25% of all 30-synapse edges on the left will consist of 21 synapses or less on the right, and 5% will consist of only 1–8 synapses. To assess how much of this edge weight variability is biological and how much is technical, we modeled the impact of technical noise on a fictive ground truth connectome."
4520,"This model was randomly subsampled according to postsynaptic completion rate, and synapses were randomly added and deleted according to the false-positive and false-negative rates reported for the synapse detection. Repeated application of this procedure generated a distribution of edge weights between each cell type pair expected due to technical noise alone. On average, 65% of the observed variability of edge weight between hemispheres fell within the range expected due to technical noise; this fraction approached 100% for weaker synapses."
4521,"For example, cell type LHCENT3 targets LHAV3g2 with 30 synapses on the left but only 23 on the right in FlyWire, which is within the 5–95% quantiles expected due to technical noise alone. Overall, this analysis shows that observed variability is greater than can be accounted for by technical noise, establishing a lower bound for likely biological variability, and suggests another simple heuristic: differences in edge weights of 30% or less may be entirely due to technical noise and should not be overinterpreted. Variability in the mushroom body: The comprehensive annotation of cell types in the FlyWire dataset revealed that the number of Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, is 30% larger per hemisphere than in the hemibrain, well above the average variation in cell counts."
4522,"While these KC counts are within the previously reported range, the difference presents an opportunity to investigate how connectomes accommodate perturbations in cell count. The mushroom body contains five principal cell classes: KCs, mushroom body output neurons, modulatory neurons, and octopaminergic neurons, along with the dorsal paired medial and anterior paired lateral neuron giant interneurons. KCs further divide into five main cell types on the basis of which parts of the mushroom body they innervate: KCab, KCab-p, KCg-m, KCa′b′, and KCg-d."
4523,"Of those, KCab, KCa′b′, and KCg-m are the primary recipients of largely random olfactory input through around 130 antennal lobe projection neurons comprising 58 canonical types. Global activity in the mushroom body is regulated through an inhibitory feedback loop mediated by APL, a single large GABAergic neuron. Analogous to the mammalian cerebellum, KCs transform the dense overlapping odor responses of the early olfactory system into sparse non-overlapping representations that enable the animal to discriminate between individual odors during associative learning."
4524,"The difference in cell counts is not evenly distributed across all KC types: KCg-m is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire compared to the hemibrain while KCab and KCab-p are present in similar numbers. Protein starvation during the larval stage can induce specific increases in KCg-m number, suggesting that environmental variations in food resources may have contributed to this difference. To examine how this affects the mushroom body circuitry, we opted to compare the fraction of the input or output synaptic budget across different KCs, as this is well matched to our question and naturally handles a range of technical noise issues that seemed particularly prominent in the mushroom body completion rate."
4525,"We found that, despite the large difference in KCg-m cell counts between FlyWire and hemibrain, this cell type consistently makes and receives 32% and 45% of all KC pre-synapses and post-synapses, respectively. This suggested that individual FlyWire KCg-m neurons receive fewer inputs and make fewer outputs than their hemibrain counterparts. The share of ALPN outputs allocated to KCg-m is around 55% across all hemispheres, and the average ALPN to KCg-m connection is comparable in strength across hemispheres; however, each KCg-m neuron receives input from a much smaller number of ALPN types in FlyWire than in the hemibrain."
4526,"FlyWire KCg-m neurons, therefore, receive inputs with the same strength but from fewer ALPNs. This pattern holds for other KCg-m synaptic partners as well. Similar to the excitatory ALPNs, the share of APL outputs allocated to KCg-m neurons is essentially constant across hemispheres."
4527,"Thus, each individual KCg-m neuron receives proportionally less inhibition from the APL, as well as less excitation, maintaining a similar excitation/inhibition ratio. Furthermore, as a population, KCg-m neurons contribute similar amounts of input to MBONs. Past theoretical work has shown that the number of discrete odor channels providing input to each KC has an optimal value for maximizing the dimensionality of KC activity and, therefore, the discriminability of olfactory input."
4528,"The smaller value for K observed for KCg-m neurons in the FlyWire connectome raises the question of how dimensionality varies with K for each of the KC types. Using the neural network rate model described previously, we calculated dimensionality as a function of K for each of the KC types, using the observed KC counts, ALPN to KC connectivity, and global inhibition from the APL. This analysis revealed that optimal values for K are lower for KCg-m neurons in FlyWire than in the hemibrain, consistent with the observed values."
4529,"Taken together, these results demonstrate that, for KCg-m neurons, the brain compensates for a developmental perturbation by changing a single parameter: the number of odor channels each KC samples from. By contrast, KCa′b′ cells, which are also more numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain, appear to use a hybrid strategy of reduced K combined with a reduction in ALPN to KCa′b′ connection strength. These findings contradict earlier studies in which a global increase in KC numbers through genetic manipulation triggered an increase in ALPN axon boutons and a modest increase in KC claws."
4530,"This may be due to the differences in the nature and timing of the perturbation in KC cell number, and the KC types affected. Toward multiconnectome cell typing, as the first dense, large-scale connectome of a fly brain, the hemibrain dataset proposed over 5,000 previously unknown cell types in addition to confirming around 400 previously reported types."
4531,"As this defines a de facto standard cell typing for large parts of the fly brain, our initial work plan was simply to reidentify hemibrain cell types in FlyWire, providing a critical resource for the fly neuroscience community. While this was successful for 68% of hemibrain cell types, 32% could not be validated. Given the great stereotypy generally exhibited by the fly nervous system, this result is both surprising and interesting."
4532,"We can imagine two basic categories of explanation. First, that through ever closer inspection, we may successfully reidentify these missing cell types. Second, that these definitions, mostly based on a single brain hemisphere, might not be robust to variation across individuals."
4533,"Distinguishing between these two explanations is not at all straightforward. We began by applying across-dataset connectivity clustering to large groups of unmatched hemibrain and FlyWire neurons. We observed that most remaining hemibrain types showed complex clustering patterns, which both separated neurons from the same proposed cell type and recombined neurons of different proposed hemibrain types."
4534,"While it is always more difficult to prove a negative result, these observations strongly suggest that the majority of the remaining 1,696 hemibrain types are not robust to interindividual variation. We, therefore, developed a definition of cell type that uses interanimal variability: a cell type is a group of neurons that are each more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other neuron in the same brain. This definition can be used with different similarity metrics, but for connectomics data, a similarity measure incorporating morphology and/or connectivity is most useful."
4535,"Our algorithmic implementation of this definition operates on the co-clustering dendrogram by finding the smallest possible clusters that satisfy two criteria: each cluster must contain neurons from all three hemispheres; within each cluster, the number of neurons from each hemisphere must be approximately equal. Determining how to cut a dendrogram generated by data clustering is a widespread challenge in data science for which there is no single satisfactory solution. A key advantage of the cell type definition that we propose is that it provides very strong guidance about how to assign neurons to clusters."
4536,"This follows naturally from the fact that connectome data provide us with all neurons in each dataset, rather than a random subsample. This advantage of completeness is familiar from analogous problems such as the ability to identify orthologous genes when whole genomes are available. Analysis of the hemibrain cell type AOTU063 provides a relatively straightforward example of our approach."
4537,"Morphology-based clustering generates a single group, comprising all six AOTU063 neurons from each of the three hemispheres. However, clustering based on connectivity reveals two discrete groups, with equal numbers of neurons from each hemisphere, suggesting that this type should be split further. Here, algorithmic analysis across multiple connectomes reveals consistent connectivity differences between subsets of AOTU063 neurons."
4538,"To test whether this approach is applicable to more challenging sets of neurons, we set aside the hemibrain types and performed a complete retyping of neurons in the central complex, a center for navigation in the insect brain that has been subject to detailed connectome analysis. We selected two large groups of neurons innervating the fan-shaped body that show a key difference in organization. The first group, FC1–3, consists of columnar cell types that tile the FB innervating adjacent non-overlapping columns."
4539,"The second group, FB1–9, contains tangential neurons where neurons of the same cell type are precisely co-located in space. Standard NBLAST similarity assumes that neurons of the same cell type overlap closely in space; although this is true for most central brain types, it does not hold for repeated columnar neurons such as those in the optic lobe or these FC neurons of the FB. We therefore used a connectivity-only distance metric co-clustering across the three hemispheres."
4540,"This resulted in seven FC clusters satisfying the above criteria. Five of these cross-brain types have a one-to-one correspondence with hemibrain types, while two are merges of multiple hemibrain types; only a small number of neurons are recombined across types. For the second group, FB1–9, a combined morphology and connectivity embedding was used."
4541,"Co-clustering across the three hemispheres generated 114 cell types compared to 146 cell types in the hemibrain. In total, 44% of these types correspond one-to-one to a hemibrain cell type; 11% are splits, 12% are merges, and 33% are recombinations of hemibrain cell types. The 67% success rate of this de novo approach in identifying hemibrain cell types is slightly higher than the 61% achieved in our directed work; it is consistent with the notion that further effort could still identify some unmatched hemibrain types, but that the majority will probably require retyping. All of the preceding efforts have focused on cell typing neurons contained within both FlyWire and the hemibrain. We next examined the extensive regions of the brain covered only by FlyWire and not by hemibrain."
4542,"Based on the lessons learned from the joint analysis of hemibrain and FlyWire, we ran a co-clustering of neurons from the two hemispheres of FlyWire to fill in missing cell types. This combined both morphology and connectivity measures, was carried out separately for each hemilineage, and produced 3,200 new central brain cell types for a total of 8,453 including the optic lobes. We further compared double-hemisphere and triple-hemisphere analysis for 25 cross-identified lineages that are not truncated in the hemibrain."
4543,"This comparison found that 70% of these new types survive the addition of a third hemisphere with minor edits. That percentage increases to 84% if we exclude cases in which just one neuron changes clusters. In summary, cell typing based on joint analysis of multiple connectomes proved capable of recapitulating many cell types identified in the hemibrain dataset while also defining new candidate cell types that are consistent both within and across datasets."
4544,"Further validation of the new types proposed by this approach will depend on additional Drosophila connectomes, which are forthcoming. We predict that cell types defined in this manner will be substantially more robust than cell types defined from a single connectome alone. Discussion: Here we generated human-readable annotations for all neurons in the fly brain at various levels of granularity: superclass, cell class, hemilineage, morphology group, and cell type."
4545,"These annotations provide salient groupings that have already been proven to be useful not only in our own analyses but also in many of those in our companion paper as well as other publications in the FlyWire paper package introduced there, and to researchers now using the online platforms Codex and FAFB-FlyWire CATMAID spaces. Hemilineage annotations also provide a key starting point to link the molecular basis of the development of the central brain to the wiring revealed by the connectome; such work has already begun in the more repetitive circuits of the optic lobe. The cell type atlas that we provide of 8,453 cell types, covering 96.4% of all neurons in the brain, is to our knowledge the largest ever proposed and, crucially, by some margin the largest ever validated collection of cell types. In C. elegans, the 118 cell types inferred from the original connectome have been clearly supported by analysis of subsequent connectomes and molecular data."
4546,"In a few cases in mammals, it has been possible to produce catalogues of around 100 cell types that have been validated by multimodal data, for example, in the retina or motor cortex. Although large-scale molecular atlases in the mouse produce highly informative hierarchies of up to 5,000 clusters, they do not yet try to define terminal cell types—the finest unit that is robust across individuals—with precision. Here we tested over 5,000 predicted cell types, resulting in 3,884 validated cell types using three hemispheres of connectome data."
4547,"Informed by this, we use the FlyWire dataset to propose an additional 3,685 cell types. Lessons for cell typing: Our experience of cell typing the FlyWire dataset together with our earlier participation in the hemibrain cell typing effort leads us to draw a number of lessons. First, we think that it is helpful to frame cell types generated in one dataset as predictions or hypotheses that can be tested either through additional connectome data or data from other modalities."
4548,"Related to this, although the two hemispheres of the same brain can be treated as two largely independent datasets, we do see evidence that variability can be correlated across hemispheres. We therefore recommend the use of three or more hemispheres to define and validate new cell types both because of increased statistical confidence and because across-brain comparisons are a strong test of cell type robustness. Third, there is no free lunch in the classic lumping versus splitting debate."
4549,"The hemibrain cell typing effort preferred to split rather than lump cell types, reasoning that over-splitting could easily be remedied by merging cell types at a later date. Although this approach seemed reasonable at the time, it appears to have led to cell types being recombined: when using a single dataset, even domain experts may find it very hard to distinguish conserved differences between cell types from interindividual noise. Moreover, although some recent studies have argued that cell types are better defined by connectivity than morphology, we find that there is a place for both."
4550,"For de novo cell typing of future connectomes, we recommend an initial morphology-only matching to assign obvious matches; these shared cell type labels can then be used to define connection similarity across datasets. This then allows extraction of balanced clusters from combined morphology and connectivity co-clustering that can be used to assign or refine existing cell types. Related to this, we find that across-dataset connection similarity is an extremely powerful way to identify cell types."
4551,"However, connectivity-based typing is typically used iteratively, and especially when used within a single dataset, this may lead to the selection of idiosyncratic features. Moreover, neurons can connect similarly but come from a different developmental lineage or express a different neurotransmitter, precluding them from sharing a cell type. Combining these two points, we would summarize that matching by morphology appears to be both more robust and sometimes less precise, whereas connectivity matching is a powerful tool that must be wielded with care."
4552,"In conclusion, connectome data are particularly suitable for cell typing: they are inherently multimodal, while the ability to see all cells within a brain is uniquely powerful. Our multiconnectome typing approach provides a robust and efficient way to use such data; cell types that have passed the rigorous test of across-connectome consistency are very unlikely to be revised. We suspect that connectome data will become the gold standard for cell typing."
4553,"Linking molecular and connectomic cell types will therefore be key. One promising new approach is exemplified by the prediction of neurotransmitter identity directly from EM images, but many others will be necessary. Finally, we address the three questions introduced in the introduction."
4554,"Can we simplify the connectome graph? Cell typing reduces the complexity of the connectome graph. This has important implications for analysis, modeling, experimental work, and developmental biology."
4555,"For example, we can reduce the 131,811 typed nodes in the raw connectome graph into a cell type graph with 8,453 nodes; the number of edges is similarly reduced. This should significantly aid human reasoning about the connectome. It will also make numerous network analyses possible as well as substantially reduce the degrees of freedom in brain-scale modeling."
4556,"It is important to note that, while collapsing multiple cells for a given cell type into a single node is often desirable, other use cases such as modeling studies may still need to retain each individual cell. However, if key parameters are determined on a per-cell type basis, then the complexity of the resultant model can be significantly reduced. A recent study optimized and analyzed a highly successful model of large parts of the fly visual system with just 734 free parameters by using connectomic cell types."
4557,"For Drosophila experimentalists using the connectome, cell typing identifies groups of cells that probably form functional units. Most of these are linked to the published literature, and in many cases, to molecular reagents."
4558,"Others will be more easily identified for targeted labeling and manipulation after typing. Finally, cell typing effectively compresses the connectome, reducing the bits required to store and specify the graph. For a fly-sized connectome, this is no longer that important for computational analysis, but it may be important for brain development."
4559,"Some have argued that evolution has selected highly structured brain connectivity, enabling animals to learn very rapidly, but that these wiring diagrams are far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome; rather, they must be compressed through a “genomic bottleneck,” which may itself have been a crucial part of evolving robust and efficient nervous systems. If we accept this argument, lossy compression based on aggregating nodes with similar cell type labels, approximately specifying strong edges, and largely ignoring weak edges would reduce the storage requirements by orders of magnitude and could be a specific implementation of this bottleneck. Which edges are important?"
4560,"The question of which of the 15.1 million edges in the connectome to pay attention to is critical for its interpretation. Intuitively, we assume that the more synapses that connect two neurons, the more important that connection must be."
4561,"There is some very limited evidence in support of this assumption correlating anatomical and functional connectivity. In lieu of physiological data, we postulate that edges that are critical to brain function should be consistently found across brains. By comparing connections between cell types identified in three hemispheres, we find that edges stronger than ten synapses or ≥0.9% of the target’s inputs have a greater than 90% chance to be preserved. This provides a simple heuristic for determining which edges are likely to be functionally relevant. It is also highly consistent with findings from the larval connectome, in which left–right asymmetries in connectivity vanish after removing edges weaker than 1."
4562,"25%. However, note that edges falling below the threshold might still significantly contribute to the brain’s function. We further address an issue that has received little attention: the impact of technical factors and biological variability on the final connectome and how to compensate for it."
4563,"In our hands, a model of technical noise could explain up to 30% of the difference in edge weights. While this model was made specifically for the two hemispheres of FlyWire, it highlights the general point that a firm understanding of all sources of variability will be vital for the young field of comparative connectomics to distinguish real and artificial differences. Have we collected a snowflake?"
4564,"The field of connectomics has long been criticized for unavoidably low sample sizes, raising the question of whether the brain of a single specimen is representative of all. For insects, there is a large body of evidence for morphological and functional stereotypy, although this information is available for only a minority of neurons, and much less is known about stereotyped connectivity. For vertebrate brains, the situation is less clear again; it is generally assumed that subcortical regions will be more stereotyped, but the cortex also has conserved canonical microcircuits, and recent evidence has shown that some cortical elements can be genetically and functionally stereotyped."
4565,"Given how critical stereotypy is for connectomics, it is important to check whether that premise actually still holds true at the synaptic resolution. For the fly connectome, the answer to our question is actually both more nuanced and more interesting than we initially imagined. Based on the conservation of edges between FlyWire and hemibrain hemispheres, over 50% of the connectome graph is a snowflake."
4566,"Of course, these non-reproducible edges are mostly weak. Our criterion for strong edges applies to between 7–16% of edges but 50–70% of synapses. We previously showed that the early olfactory system of the fly is highly stereotyped in both neuronal number and connectivity."
4567,"That study used the same EM datasets—FAFB and the hemibrain—but was limited in scope as only manual reconstruction in FAFB was then available. We now analyze brain-wide data from two brains and three hemispheres to address this question and find a high degree of stereotypy at every level: neuron counts are highly consistent between brains, as are connections above a certain weight. However, when examining so many neurons in a brain, we can see that cell counts are very different for some neurons; furthermore, neurons occasionally do something unexpected."
4568,"In fact, we hypothesize that such stochastic differences are unnoticed variability present in most brains; this is reminiscent of the observation that most humans carry multiple significant genetic mutations. We did observe one example of a substantial biological difference that was consistent across hemispheres but not brains: the number of the KCg-m neurons in the mushroom bodies is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire as in the hemibrain. Notably, we found evidence that the brain compensates for this perturbation by modifying connectivity."
4569,"In conclusion, we have not collected a snowflake. The core FlyWire connectome is highly conserved, and the accompanying annotations will be broadly useful across all studies of D. melanogaster."
4570,"However, our analyses show the importance of calibrating our understanding of biological variability—as has recently been done across animals in C. elegans and across hemispheres in larval Drosophila. This will be crucial when using future connectomes to identify true biological differences, for example, in sexually dimorphic circuits or changes due to learning."
4571,"All tissues and organs in the body consist of cells. The specialized functions of cells and how they interact determine the functions of organs. The brain is an organ—to be sure, the most sophisticated and complex organ that nature has devised."
4572,"But the basic strategy for unraveling its function is no different from that used to investigate the pancreas or the lung. We must begin by learning how brain cells work individually and then see how they are assembled to work together. In neuroscience, there is no need to separate mind from brain; once we fully understand the individual and concerted actions of brain cells, we will understand the origins of our mental abilities."
4573,"The organization of this book reflects this ""neurophilosophy."" We start with the cells of the nervous system—their structure, function, and means of communication. In later chapters, we will explore how these cells are assembled into circuits that mediate sensation, perception, movement, speech, and emotion."
4574,"In this chapter, we focus on the structure of the different types of cells in the nervous system: neurons and glia. These are broad categories, within which are many types of cells that differ based on their structure, chemistry, and function. Nonetheless, the distinction between neurons and glia is important."
4575,"Although there are many neurons in the human brain, glia outnumber neurons by tenfold. Based on these numbers, it might appear that we should focus our attention on glia for insights into the cellular functions of the nervous system. However, neurons are the most important cells for the unique functions of the brain."
4576,"It is the neurons that sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations. Glia, or glial cells, are thought to contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons. If the brain were a chocolate-chip cookie and the neurons were chocolate chips, the glia would be the cookie dough that fills all the other space and ensures that the chips are suspended in their appropriate locations."
4577,"Indeed, the term glia is derived from the Greek word for ""glue,"" giving the impression that the main function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears! As we shall see later in the chapter, the simplicity of this view is probably a good indication of the depth of our ignorance about glial function. However, we still are confident that neurons perform the bulk of information processing in the brain. Therefore, we will focus 90% of our attention on 10% of brain cells: the neurons."
4578,"Neuroscience, like other fields, has a language all its own. To use this language, you must learn the vocabulary. After you have read this chapter, take a few minutes to review the key terms list and make sure you understand the meaning of each term."
4579,"Your neuroscience vocabulary will grow as you work your way through the book. To study the structure of brain cells, scientists have had to overcome several obstacles. The first was the small size."
4580,Most cells are in the range of 0.01–0.05 mm in diameter.
4581,"The tip of an unsharpened pencil lead is about 2 mm across; neurons are 40–200 times smaller. This size is at or beyond the limit of what can be seen by the naked eye. Therefore, progress in cellular neuroscience was not possible before the development of the compound microscope in the late seventeenth century."
4582,"Even then, obstacles remained. To observe brain tissue using a microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much thicker than the diameter of the cells. However, brain tissue has a consistency like that of a bowl of Jello: not firm enough to make thin slices."
4583,"Thus, the study of the anatomy of brain cells had to await the development of a method to harden the tissue without disturbing its structure and an instrument that could produce very thin slices. Early in the nineteenth century, scientists discovered how to harden, or ""fix,"" tissues by immersing them in formaldehyde and developed a special device called a microtome to make very thin slices. These technical advances spawned the field of histology, the microscopic study of the structure of tissues."
4584,"But scientists studying brain structure faced yet another obstacle. Freshly prepared brain has a uniform, cream-colored appearance under the microscope; the tissue has no differences in pigmentation to enable histologists to resolve individual cells. Thus, the final breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of stains that could selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain tissue."
4585,"One stain, still used today, was introduced by the German neurologist Franz Nissl in the late nineteenth century. Nissl showed that a class of basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells and also stain clumps of material surrounding the nuclei of neurons. These clumps are called Nissl bodies, and the stain is known as the Nissl stain."
4586,"The Nissl stain is extremely useful for two reasons. First, it distinguishes neurons and glia from one another. Second, it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or cytoarchitecture, of neurons in different parts of the brain."
4587,"The study of cytoarchitecture led to the realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions. We now know that each region performs a different function. The Nissl stain, however, does not tell the whole story."
4588,"A Nissl-stained neuron looks like little more than a lump of protoplasm containing a nucleus. Neurons are much more than that, but how much more was not recognized until the publication of the work of Italian histologist Camillo Golgi. In 1873, Golgi discovered that by soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution, now called the Golgi stain, a small percentage of neurons became darkly colored in their entirety."
4589,"This revealed that the neuronal cell body, the region of the neuron around the nucleus that is shown with the Nissl stain, is actually only a small fraction of the total structure of the neuron. Notice how different histological stains can provide strikingly different views of the same tissue. Today, neurohistology remains an active field in neuroscience, along with its credo: ""The gain in brain is mainly in the stain."" The Golgi stain shows that neurons have at least two distinguishable parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region."
4590,"The swollen region containing the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably: cell body, soma, and perikaryon. The thin tubes that radiate away from the soma are called neurites and are of two types: axons and dendrites. The cell body usually gives rise to a single axon."
4591,"The axon is of uniform diameter throughout its length, and if it branches, the branches generally extend at right angles. Because axons can travel over great distances in the body, it was immediately recognized by the histologists of the day that axons must act like “wires” that carry the output of the neurons. Dendrites, on the other hand, rarely extend more than 2 mm in length."
4592,"Many dendrites extend from the cell body and generally taper to a fine point. Early histologists recognized that because dendrites come into contact with many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals, or input. Golgi invented the stain, but it was a Spanish contemporary of Golgi who used it to greatest effect."
4593,"Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a skilled histologist and artist who learned about Golgi’s method in 1888. In a remarkable series of publications over the next 25 years, Cajal used the Golgi stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain. Ironically, Golgi and Cajal drew completely opposite conclusions about neurons."
4594,"Golgi championed the view that the neurites of different cells are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar to the arteries and veins of the circulatory system. According to this reticular theory, the brain is an exception to the cell theory, which states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of all animal tissues. Cajal, on the other hand, argued forcefully that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another and must communicate by contact, not continuity."
4595,"This idea that the neuron adhered to the cell theory came to be known as the neuron doctrine. Although Golgi and Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in 1906, they remained rivals to the end. The scientific evidence over the next 50 years weighed heavily in favor of the neuron doctrine, but final proof had to wait until the development of the electron microscope in the 1950s."
4596,"With the increased resolving power of the electron microscope, it was finally possible to show that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another. Thus, our starting point in the exploration of the brain must be the individual neuron. The human eye can distinguish two points only if they are separated by more than about one-tenth of a millimeter."
4597,"Thus, we can say that 100 µm is near the limit of resolution for the unaided eye. Neurons have a diameter of about 20 µm, and neurites can measure as small as a fraction of a micrometer. The light microscope, therefore, was a necessary development before neuronal structure could be studied."
4598,"But this type of microscopy has a theoretical limit imposed by the properties of microscope lenses and visible light. With the standard light microscope, the limit of resolution is about 0.1 µm."
4599,"However, the space between neurons measures only 0.02 µm. No wonder two esteemed scientists, Golgi and Cajal, disagreed about whether neurites were continuous from one cell to the next."
4600,"This question could not be answered until the electron microscope was developed and applied to biological specimens, which occurred only within the past 60 years or so. The electron microscope uses an electron beam instead of light to form images, dramatically increasing the resolving power. The limit of resolution for an electron microscope is about 0."
4601,"1 nm—a million times better than the unaided eye. Our insights into the fine structure of the inside of neurons—the ultrastructure—have all come from electron microscopic examination of the brain. Today, microscopes on the leading edge of technology use laser beams to illuminate the tissue and computers to create digital images."
4602,"Unlike traditional methods of light and electron microscopy, which require tissue fixation, these new techniques give neuroscientists their first chance to peer into brain tissue that is still alive. As we have seen, the neuron consists of several parts: the soma, the dendrites, and the axon. The inside of the neuron is separated from the outside by the limiting skin, the neuronal membrane, which lies like a circus tent on an intricate internal scaffolding, giving each part of the cell its special three-dimensional appearance."
4603,"Let’s explore the inside of the neuron and learn about the functions of the different parts. The Soma: We begin our tour at the soma, the roughly spherical central part of the neuron. The cell body of the typical neuron is about 20 μm in diameter."
4604,"The watery fluid inside the cell, called the cytosol, is a salty, potassium-rich solution that is separated from the outside by the neuronal membrane. Within the soma are a number of membrane-enclosed structures called organelles. The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles that are found in all animal cells."
4605,"The most important ones are the nucleus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria. Everything contained within the confines of the cell membrane, including the organelles but excluding the nucleus, is referred to collectively as the cytoplasm. The Nucleus."
4606,"Its name derived from the Latin word for “nut,” the nucleus of the cell is spherical, centrally located, and about 5–10 μm across. It is contained within a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is perforated by pores that measure about 0.1 μm across. Within the nucleus are chromosomes, which contain the genetic material, DNA. Your DNA was passed on to you from your parents, and it contains the blueprint for your entire body."
4607,"The DNA in each of your neurons is the same, and it is the same as the DNA in the cells of your liver and kidney. What distinguishes a neuron from a liver cell are the specific parts of the DNA that are used to assemble the cell. These segments of DNA are called genes."
4608,"Each chromosome contains an uninterrupted double-stranded braid of DNA, 2 nm wide. If the DNA from the 46 human chromosomes were laid out straight, end to end, it would measure more than 2 m in length. If we were to consider this total length of DNA as analogous to the string of letters that makes up this book, the genes would be analogous to the individual words."
4609,Genes can measure anywhere from 0.1 μm to several micrometers in length. The “reading” of the DNA is known as gene expression.
4610,"The final product of gene expression is the synthesis of molecules called proteins, which exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, perform many different functions, and bestow upon neurons virtually all of their unique characteristics. Protein synthesis, the assembly of protein molecules, occurs in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA never leaves the nucleus, there must be an intermediary that carries the genetic message to the sites of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm."
4611,"This function is performed by another long molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA. Messenger RNA consists of four different nucleic acids strung together in various sequences to form a chain. The detailed sequence of the nucleic acids in the chain represents the information in the gene, just as the sequence of letters gives meaning to a written word."
4612,"The process of assembling a piece of mRNA that contains the information of a gene is called transcription, and the resulting mRNA is called the transcript. Protein-coding genes are flanked by stretches of DNA that are not used to encode proteins but are important for regulating transcription. At one end of the gene is the promoter, the region where the RNA-synthesizing enzyme, RNA polymerase, binds to initiate transcription."
4613,"The binding of the polymerase to the promoter is tightly regulated by other proteins called transcription factors. At the other end is a sequence of DNA called the terminator that the RNA polymerase recognizes as the endpoint for transcription. In addition to the non-coding regions of DNA that flank the genes, there are often additional stretches of DNA within the gene itself that cannot be used to code for protein."
4614,"These interspersed regions are called introns, and the coding sequences are called exons. Initial transcripts contain both introns and exons, but then, by a process called RNA splicing, the introns are removed and the remaining exons are fused together. In some cases, specific exons are also removed with the introns, leaving an “alternatively spliced” mRNA that actually encodes a different protein."
4615,"Thus, transcription of a single gene can ultimately give rise to several different mRNAs and protein products. Messenger RNA transcripts emerge from the nucleus via pores in the nuclear envelope and travel to the sites of protein synthesis elsewhere in the neuron. At these sites, a protein molecule is assembled much as the mRNA molecule was: by linking together many small molecules into a chain."
4616,"In the case of protein, the building blocks are amino acids, of which there are 20 different kinds. This assembling of proteins from amino acids under the direction of the mRNA is called translation. The scientific study of this process, which begins with the DNA of the nucleus and ends with the synthesis of protein molecules in the cell, is known as molecular biology."
4617,The “central dogma” of molecular biology is summarized as follows: A new field within neuroscience is called molecular neurobiology. Molecular neurobiologists use the information contained in the genes to determine the structure and functions of neuronal proteins. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum.
4618,"Not far from the nucleus are enclosed stacks of membrane dotted with dense globular structures called ribosomes, which measure about 25 nm in diameter. The stacks are called rough endoplasmic reticulum, or rough ER. Rough ER abounds in neurons, far more than in glia or most other non-neuronal cells."
4619,"In fact, we have already been introduced to rough ER by another name: Nissl bodies. This organelle is stained with the dyes that Nissl introduced 100 years ago. Rough ER is a major site of protein synthesis in neurons."
4620,"RNA transcripts bind to ribosomes, and ribosomes translate the instructions contained in the mRNA to assemble a protein molecule. Thus, ribosomes take raw material in the form of amino acids and manufacture proteins using the blueprint provided by the mRNA. Not all ribosomes are attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)."
4621,"Many are freely floating and are called free ribosomes. Several free ribosomes may appear to be attached by a thread; these are called polyribosomes. The thread is a single strand of mRNA, and the associated ribosomes are working on it to make multiple copies of the same protein."
4622,"What is the difference between proteins synthesized on the rough ER and those synthesized on free ribosomes? The answer appears to lie in the intended fate of the protein molecule. If it is destined to reside within the cytosol of the neuron, then the protein’s mRNA transcript shuns the ribosomes of the rough ER and gravitates toward the free ribosomes."
4623,"Sequencing the human genome—the entire length of DNA that comprises the genetic information in our chromosomes—was a truly monumental achievement completed in 2003. The Human Genome Project identified all of the approximately 20,000 genes in human DNA. We now live in what has been called the “post-genomic era,” in which information about the genes expressed in our tissues can be used to diagnose and treat diseases."
4624,"Neuroscientists are now using this information to tackle long-standing questions about the biological basis of neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to probe deeper into the origins of individuality. The logic goes as follows: the brain is the product of the genes expressed in it."
4625,"Differences in gene expression between a normal brain and a diseased brain, or a brain of unusual ability, can be used to identify the molecular basis of the observed symptoms or traits. The level of gene expression is usually defined as the number of mRNA transcripts synthesized by different cells and tissues to direct the synthesis of specific proteins. Thus, the analysis of gene expression requires a method to compare the relative abundance of various mRNAs in the brains of two groups of humans or animals."
4626,"One way to perform such a comparison is to use DNA microarrays, which are created by robotic machines that arrange thousands of small spots of synthetic DNA on a microscope slide. Each spot contains a unique DNA sequence that will recognize and stick to a different specific mRNA sequence. To compare gene expression in two brains, one begins by collecting a sample of mRNAs from each brain."
4627,"The mRNA of one brain is labeled with a chemical tag that fluoresces green, and the mRNA of the other brain is labeled with a tag that fluoresces red. These samples are then applied to the microarray. Highly expressed genes will produce brightly fluorescent spots, and differences in the relative gene expression between the brains will be revealed by differences in the color of the fluorescence."
4628,"However, if the protein is destined to be inserted into the membrane of the cell or an organelle, then it is synthesized on the rough ER. As the protein is being assembled, it is threaded back and forth through the membrane of the rough ER, where it is trapped. It is not surprising that neurons are so well endowed with rough ER because, as we shall see in later chapters, special membrane proteins are what give these cells their remarkable information-processing abilities."
4629,"Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi Apparatus: The remainder of the cytosol of the soma is crowded with stacks of membranous organelles that look a lot like rough ER without the ribosomes, so much so that one type is called smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or smooth ER. Smooth ER is actually quite heterogeneous and performs different functions in different locations."
4630,"Some smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is continuous with rough ER and is believed to be a site where the proteins that jut out from the membrane are carefully folded, giving them their three-dimensional structure. Other types of smooth ER play no direct role in the processing of protein molecules but instead regulate the internal concentrations of substances such as calcium. The stack of membrane-enclosed disks in the soma that lies farthest from the nucleus is the Golgi apparatus, first described in 1898 by Camillo Golgi."
4631,"This is a site of extensive “post-translational” chemical processing of proteins. One important function of the Golgi apparatus is believed to be the sorting of certain proteins that are destined for delivery to different parts of the neuron, such as the axon and the dendrites."
4632,"Another very abundant organelle in the soma is the mitochondrion. In neurons, these sausage-shaped structures measure about 1 μm in length. Within the enclosure of their outer membrane are multiple folds of inner membrane called cristae."
4633,"Between the cristae is an inner space called the matrix. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration. When a mitochondrion “inhales,” it pulls inside pyruvic acid and oxygen, both of which are floating in the cytosol."
4634,"Within the inner compartment of the mitochondrion, pyruvic acid enters into a complex series of biochemical reactions called the Krebs cycle, named after the German-British scientist Hans Krebs, who first proposed it in 1937. The biochemical products of the Krebs cycle provide energy that, in another series of reactions within the cristae, results in the addition of phosphate to adenosine diphosphate, yielding adenosine triphosphate, the cell’s energy source. When the mitochondrion “exhales,” 17 ATP molecules are released for every molecule of pyruvic acid that had been taken in."
4635,"ATP is the energy currency of the cell. The chemical energy stored in ATP is used to fuel most of the biochemical reactions of the neuron. For example, special proteins in the neuronal membrane use the energy released by the breakdown of ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to pump certain substances across the membrane to establish concentration differences between the inside and the outside of the neuron."
4636,The neuronal membrane serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron. The membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins. Some of the membrane-associated proteins pump substances from the inside to the outside.
4637,"Others form pores that regulate which substances can gain access to the inside of the neuron. An important characteristic of neurons is that the protein composition of the membrane varies depending on whether it is in the soma, the dendrites, or the axon. The function of neurons cannot be understood without understanding the structure and function of the membrane and its associated proteins."
4638,"In fact, this topic is so important that we’ll spend a good deal of the next four chapters looking at how the membrane endows neurons with the remarkable ability to transfer electrical signals throughout the brain and body. Earlier, we compared the neuronal membrane to a circus tent that was draped on an internal scaffolding. This scaffolding is called the cytoskeleton, and it gives the neuron its characteristic shape."
4639,"The “bones” of the cytoskeleton are the microtubules, microfilaments, and neurofilaments. By drawing an analogy with scaffolding, we do not mean that the cytoskeleton is static. On the contrary, elements of the cytoskeleton are dynamically regulated and are very likely in continual motion."
4640,"Your neurons are probably squirming around in your head even as you read this sentence. Microtubules, measuring 20 nm in diameter, are large and run longitudinally down neurites."
4641,"A microtubule appears as a straight, thick-walled hollow pipe. The wall of the pipe is composed of smaller strands that are braided like rope around the hollow core. Each of the smaller strands consists of the protein tubulin."
4642,"A single tubulin molecule is small and globular; the strand consists of tubulins stuck together like pearls on a string. The process of joining small proteins to form a long strand is called polymerization; the resulting strand is called a polymer. Polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules and, therefore, of neuronal shape can be regulated by various signals within the neuron."
4643,"One class of proteins that participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly and function are microtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs. Among other functions, MAPs anchor the microtubules to one another and to other parts of the neuron. Pathological changes in an axonal MAP, called tau, have been implicated in the dementia that accompanies Alzheimer’s disease."
4644,"Neurites are the most remarkable structural feature of a neuron. Their elaborate branching patterns, critical for information processing, reflect the organization of the underlying cytoskeleton. It is therefore no surprise that a devastating loss of brain function can result when the cytoskeleton of neurons is disrupted."
4645,"An example is Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by the disruption of the cytoskeleton of neurons in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain crucial for cognitive function. This disorder and its underlying brain pathology were first described in 1907 by the German physician A. Alzheimer in a paper titled “A Characteristic Disease of the Cerebral Cortex.”"
4646,"Below are excerpts from the English translation. One of the first disease symptoms of a 51-year-old woman was a strong feeling of jealousy toward her husband. Very soon she showed rapidly increasing memory impairments; she could not find her way about her home, she dragged objects to and fro, hid herself, or sometimes thought that people were out to kill her, then she would start to scream loudly."
4647,"During institutionalization, her gestures showed complete helplessness. She was disoriented as to time and place. From time to time, she would state that she did not understand anything, that she felt confused and totally lost."
4648,"Sometimes she considered the coming of the doctor as an official visit and apologized for not having finished her work, but other times she would start to yell in fear that the doctor wanted to operate on her; or there were times when she would send him away in complete indignation, uttering phrases that indicated her fear that the doctor wanted to damage her woman’s honor. From time to time, she was completely delirious, dragging her blankets and sheets to and fro, calling for her husband and daughter, and seeming to have auditory hallucinations. Often she would scream for hours in a horrible voice."
4649,"Mental regression advanced quite steadily. After four and a half years of illness, the patient died. She was completely apathetic in the end and was confined to bed in a fetal position."
4650,"Following her death, Alzheimer examined the woman’s brain under the microscope. He made particular note of changes in the “neurofibrils,” elements of the cytoskeleton that are stained by a silver solution. The Bielschowsky silver preparation showed very characteristic changes in the neurofibrils."
4651,"However, inside an apparently normal-looking cell, one or more single fibers could be observed that became prominent through their striking thickness and specific impregnability. At a more advanced stage, many fibrils arranged parallel showed the same changes. Then they accumulated, forming dense bundles and gradually advanced to the surface of the cell."
4652,"Eventually, the nucleus and cytoplasm disappeared, and only a tangled bundle of fibrils indicated the site where once the neuron had been located. As these fibrils can be stained with dyes different from the normal neurofibrils, a chemical transformation of the fibril substance must have taken place. This might be the reason why the fibrils survived the destruction of the cell."
4653,"It seems that the transformation of the fibrils goes hand in hand with the storage of a yet not closely examined pathological product of metabolism in the neuron. About one-quarter to one-third of all the neurons of the cerebral cortex showed such alterations. Numerous neurons, especially in the upper cell layers, had totally disappeared."
4654,"The severity of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease is well correlated with the number and distribution of what are now commonly known as neurofibrillary tangles, the “tombstones” of dead and dying neurons. Indeed, as Alzheimer speculated, tangle formation in the cerebral cortex very likely causes the symptoms of the disease. Electron microscopy reveals that the major components of the tangles are paired helical filaments, long fibrous proteins braided together like strands of a rope."
4655,"It is now understood that these filaments consist of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau normally functions as a bridge between the microtubules in axons, ensuring that they run straight and parallel to one another. In Alzheimer’s disease, tau detaches from the microtubules and accumulates in the soma."
4656,"This disruption of the cytoskeleton causes the axons to wither, thus impeding the normal flow of information in the affected neurons. What causes the changes in tau? Attention is focused on another protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, called amyloid."
4657,"The field of Alzheimer’s disease research moves very fast, but the consensus today is that the abnormal secretion of amyloid by neurons is the first step in the process that leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation and dementia. Current hope for therapeutic intervention is focused on strategies to reduce the deposits of amyloid in the brain. The need for effective therapy is urgent: In the United States alone, more than 4 million people are afflicted with this tragic disease."
4658,"Microfilaments: Measuring only 5 nm in diameter, microfilaments are about the same thickness as the cell membrane. Found throughout the neuron, they are particularly numerous in the neurites."
4659,"Microfilaments are braids of two thin strands, and the strands are polymers of the protein actin. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells of all types, including neurons, and is believed to play a role in changing cell shape. Indeed, as we shall see in Chapter 13, actin filaments are critically involved in the mechanism of muscle contraction."
4660,"Like microtubules, actin microfilaments are constantly undergoing assembly and disassembly, and this process is regulated by signals in the neuron. Besides running longitudinally down the core of the neurites like microtubules, microfilaments are also closely associated with the membrane. They are anchored to the membrane by attachments with a meshwork of fibrous proteins that line the inside of the membrane like a spider web."
4661,"Neurofilaments: With a diameter of 10 nm, neurofilaments are intermediate in size between microtubules and microfilaments. They exist in all cells of the body as intermediate filaments; only in neurons are they called neurofilaments."
4662,"The difference in name actually does reflect subtle differences in structure from one tissue to the next. An example of an intermediate filament from another tissue is keratin, which, when bundled together, makes up hair. Of the types of fibrous structures we have discussed, neurofilaments most closely resemble the bones and ligaments of the skeleton."
4663,"A neurofilament consists of multiple subunits that are organized like a chain of sausages. The internal structure of each subunit consists of three protein strands woven together. Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, these strands consist of individual long protein molecules, each of which is coiled in a tight, springlike configuration."
4664,"This structure makes neurofilaments mechanically very strong. The Axon: So far, we’ve explored the soma, organelles, membrane, and cytoskeleton. However, none of these structures is unique to neurons; they are found in all the cells in our body."
4665,"Now we encounter the axon, a structure found only in neurons that is highly specialized for the transfer of information over distances in the nervous system. The axon begins with a region called the axon hillock, which tapers to form the initial segment of the axon proper. Two noteworthy features distinguish the axon from the soma: 1. No rough ER extends into the axon, and there are few, if any, free ribosomes. 2. The protein composition of the axon membrane is fundamentally different from that of the soma membrane."
4666,"These structural differences translate into functional distinctions. Because there are no ribosomes, there is no protein synthesis in the axon. This means that all proteins in the axon must originate in the soma."
4667,"And it is the different proteins in the axonal membrane that enable it to serve as the “telegraph wire” that sends information over great distances. Axons may extend from less than a millimeter to over a meter long. Axons often branch, and these branches are called axon collaterals."
4668,"Occasionally, an axon collateral will return to communicate with the same cell that gave rise to the axon or with the dendrites of neighboring cells. These axon branches are called recurrent collaterals. The diameter of an axon is variable, ranging from less than 1 μm to about 25 μm in humans and to as large as 1 mm in the squid."
4669,"This variation in axon size is important. As will be explained in Chapter 4, the speed of the electrical signal that travels down the axon—the nerve impulse—varies depending on axonal diameter. The thicker the axon, the faster the impulse travels."
4670,"The Axon Terminal. All axons have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The end is called the axon terminal or terminal bouton, reflecting the fact that it usually appears as a swollen disk."
4671,"The terminal is a site where the axon comes in contact with other neurons and passes information on to them. This point of contact is called the synapse, a word derived from Greek, meaning “to fasten together.” Sometimes axons have many branches at their ends, and each branch forms a synapse on dendrites or cell bodies in the same region."
4672,These branches are collectively called the terminal arbor. Sometimes axons form synapses at swollen regions along their length and then continue onward to terminate elsewhere. Such swellings are called boutons en passant.
4673,"In either case, when a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell, it is said to innervate that cell, or to provide innervation. The cytoplasm of the axon terminal differs from that of the axon in several ways: The Synapse. Although Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted entirely to how information is transferred from one neuron to another at the synapse, we provide a preview here."
4674,"The synapse has two sides: presynaptic and postsynaptic. These names indicate the usual direction of information flow, which is from “pre” to “post.” The presynaptic side generally consists of an axon terminal, while the postsynaptic side may be the dendrite or soma of another neuron."
4675,"The space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes is called the synaptic cleft. The transfer of information at the synapse from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission. At most synapses, information in the form of electrical impulses traveling down the axon is converted in the terminal into a chemical signal that crosses the synaptic cleft."
4676,"On the postsynaptic membrane, this chemical signal is converted again into an electrical one. The chemical signal is called a neurotransmitter, and it is stored in and released from the synaptic vesicles within the terminal. As we will see, different neurotransmitters are used by different types of neurons."
4677,"This electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical transformation of information makes possible many of the brain’s computational abilities. Modification of this process is involved in memory and learning, and synaptic transmission dysfunction accounts for certain mental disorders. The synapse is also the site of action for many toxins and for most psychoactive drugs."
4678,"Axoplasmic Transport. As mentioned, one feature of the cytoplasm of axons, including the terminal, is the absence of ribosomes. Because ribosomes are the protein factories of the cell, their absence means that the proteins of the axon must be synthesized in the soma and then shipped down the axon."
4679,"Indeed, in the mid-nineteenth century, English physiologist Augustus Waller showed that axons cannot be sustained when separated from their parent cell body. The degeneration of axons that occurs when they are cut is now called Wallerian degeneration. Because it can be detected with certain staining methods, Wallerian degeneration is one way to trace axonal connections in the brain."
4680,"Wallerian degeneration occurs because the normal flow of materials from the soma to the axon terminal is interrupted. This movement of material down the axon is called axoplasmic transport, first demonstrated directly by the experiments of American neurobiologist Paul Weiss and his colleagues in the 1940s. They found that if they tied a thread around an axon, material accumulated on the side of the axon closest to the soma."
4681,"When the knot was untied, the accumulated material continued down the axon at a rate of 1–10 mm per day. This was a remarkable discovery, but it is not the whole story. If all material moved down the axon by this transport mechanism alone, it would not reach the ends of the longest axons for at least half a year—too long a wait to feed hungry synapses."
4682,"In the late 1960s, methods were developed to track the movements of protein molecules down the axon into the terminal. These methods entailed injecting the somata of neurons with radioactive amino acids. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins."
4683,"The ""hot"" amino acids were assembled into proteins, and the arrival of radioactive proteins in the axon terminal was measured to calculate the rate of transport. Bernice Grafstein of Rockefeller University discovered that this fast axoplasmic transport occurred at a rate as high as 1000 mm per day. Much is now known about how axoplasmic transport works."
4684,"Material is enclosed within vesicles, which then ""walk down"" the microtubules of the axon. The ""legs"" are provided by a protein called kinesin, and the process is fueled by ATP. Kinesin moves material only from the soma to the terminal."
4685,"All movement of material in this direction is called anterograde transport. In addition to anterograde transport, there is a mechanism for the movement of material up the axon from the terminal to the soma. This process is believed to provide signals to the soma about changes in the metabolic needs of the axon terminal."
4686,"Movement in this direction, from terminal to soma, is called retrograde transport. The molecular mechanism is similar to anterograde transport, except the ""legs"" for retrograde transport are provided by a different protein, dynein. Both anterograde and retrograde transport mechanisms have been exploited by neuroscientists to trace connections in the brain."
4687,"The term dendrite is derived from the Greek for ""tree,"" reflecting the fact that these neurites resemble the branches of a tree as they extend from the soma. The dendrites of a single neuron are collectively called a dendritic tree; each branch of the tree is called a dendritic branch. The wide variety of shapes and sizes of dendritic trees are used to classify different groups of neurons."
4688,"Because dendrites function as the antennae of the neuron, they are covered with thousands of synapses. The dendritic membrane under the synapse has many specialized protein molecules called receptors that detect the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Fast anterograde transport of proteins in axons was shown by injecting the soma with radioactive amino acids."
4689,"The success of this method immediately suggested a way to trace connections in the brain. For example, to determine where neurons in the eye send their axons, the eye was injected with radioactive proline, an amino acid. The proline was incorporated into proteins in the somata that were then transported to the axon terminals."
4690,"By using a technique called autoradiography, the location of radioactive axon terminals could be detected, thereby revealing the extent of the connection between the eye and the brain. Researchers subsequently discovered that retrograde transport could also be exploited to work out connections in the brain. Strangely enough, the enzyme horseradish peroxidase is selectively taken up by axon terminals and then transported retrogradely to the soma."
4691,A chemical reaction can then be initiated to visualize the location of the horseradish peroxidase in slices of brain tissue. This method is commonly used to trace connections in the brain. Some viruses also exploit retrograde transport to infect neurons.
4692,"For example, the oral type of herpesvirus enters axon terminals in the lips and mouth and is then transported back to the parent cell bodies. Here, the virus usually remains dormant until physical or emotional stress occurs, at which time it replicates and returns to the nerve endings, causing a painful cold sore. Similarly, the rabies virus enters the nervous system by retrograde transport through axons in the skin."
4693,"However, once inside the soma, the virus wastes no time in replicating rapidly, killing its neuronal host. The virus is then taken up by other neurons within the nervous system, and the process repeats itself again and again, usually until the victim dies. The dendrites of some neurons are covered with specialized structures called dendritic spines that receive some types of synaptic input."
4694,Spines look like little punching bags that hang off the dendrite. The unusual morphology of spines has fascinated neuroscientists ever since their discovery by Cajal. They are believed to isolate various chemical reactions that are triggered by some types of synaptic activation.
4695,Spine structure is sensitive to the type and amount of synaptic activity. Unusual changes in spines have been shown to occur in the brains of individuals with cognitive impairments. William Greenough of the University of Illinois at Urbana discovered that spine number is also very sensitive to the quality of the environment experienced during early development and in adulthood.
4696,"The elaborate architecture of a neuron’s dendritic tree is a good reflection of the complexity of its synaptic connections with other neurons. Brain function depends on these highly precise synaptic connections, which are formed during the fetal period and are refined during infancy and early childhood. Not surprisingly, this very complex developmental process is vulnerable to disruption."
4697,"Mental retardation is said to occur if a disruption of brain development results in subaverage cognitive functioning that impairs adaptive behavior. The use of standardized tests indicates that intelligence in the general population is distributed along a bell-shaped curve. By convention, the mean intelligence quotient is set to be 100."
4698,"About two-thirds of the total population falls within 15 points of the mean, and 95% of the population falls within 30 points. People with intelligence scores below 70 are considered to be mentally retarded if the cognitive impairment affects the person’s ability to adapt his or her behavior to the setting in which he or she lives. Some 2–3% of humans fit this description."
4699,Mental retardation has many causes. The most severe forms are associated with genetic disorders. An example is a condition called phenylketonuria.
4700,"The basic abnormality is a deficit in the liver enzyme that metabolizes the dietary amino acid phenylalanine. Infants born with PKU have an abnormally high level of the amino acid in the blood and brain. If the condition goes untreated, brain growth is stunted, and severe mental retardation results."
4701,"Another example is Down syndrome, which occurs when the fetus has an extra copy of chromosome 21, thus disrupting normal gene expression during brain development. A second known cause of mental retardation is accidents during pregnancy and childbirth. Examples are maternal infections with German measles and asphyxia during childbirth."
4702,"A third cause of mental retardation is poor nutrition during pregnancy. An example is fetal alcohol syndrome, a constellation of developmental abnormalities that occur in children born to alcoholic mothers. A fourth cause, thought to account for the majority of cases, is environmental impoverishment—the lack of good nutrition, socialization, and sensory stimulation—during infancy."
4703,"While some forms of mental retardation have very clear physical correlates, most cases have only behavioral manifestations. The brains of these individuals appear grossly normal. How, then, do we account for the profound cognitive impairment?"
4704,"An important clue came in the 1970s from the research of Miguel Marin-Padilla, working at Dartmouth College, and Dominick Purpura, working at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Using the Golgi stain, they studied the brains of children with mental retardation and discovered remarkable changes in dendritic structure. The dendrites of these children had many fewer dendritic spines, and the spines that they did have were unusually long and thin."
4705,The extent of the spine changes was well correlated with the degree of mental retardation. Dendritic spines are an important target of synaptic input. Purpura pointed out that the dendritic spines of children with mental retardation resemble those of the normal human fetus.
4706,"He suggested that mental retardation reflects the failure of normal circuits to form in the brain. In the 3 decades since this seminal work was published, it has been established that normal synaptic development, including maturation of the dendritic spines, depends critically on the environment during infancy and early childhood. An impoverished environment during an early “critical period” of development can lead to profound changes in the circuits of the brain."
4707,"However, there is some good news. Many of the deprivation-induced changes in the brain can be reversed if intervention occurs early enough. In Chapter 22, we will take a closer look at the role of experience in brain development."
4708,"It is a frequent misconception that scientific research results in simple, clear answers to questions. The truth is that almost every answer results in a whole battery of new questions. But the research serves to increase our understanding so that we know how to frame the new questions and try to tackle them."
4709,"When we first saw polyribosomes below synapses in dendritic spines, we asked: “What are they doing away from the soma, where mRNA is usually translated?” An exciting possibility was that they might make special proteins that were involved in remodeling the synapse. I had seen that in animals exposed to enriched environments, new spines were made and other spines were remodeled from small to larger structures with—presumably—more efficient signaling."
4710,"Could these synaptic polyribosomes be manufacturing crucial proteins that could account for the improved efficiency? Some kind of “memory proteins”? I recalled a paper by Hollingsworth, in which he figured out a way to shear off synapses on spines, a preparation called synaptoneurosomes, and study them biochemically."
4711,"My colleague Ivan Jeanne Weiler and I attempted to isolate the mRNA in synaptoneurosomes to identify the crucial “memory proteins.” Repeated failures, due apparently to mRNA degradation, both frustrated and slowed us. But eventually, we found that some of the mRNA was being incorporated into polyribosomes, meaning that protein was being synthesized."
4712,"We then discovered that this protein synthesis was strongly increased when we stimulated the synaptoneurosomes with the neurotransmitter glutamate, and we were able to identify the glutamate receptor that was responsible. We now thought we were poised to isolate the “memory proteins” from the newly assembled polyribosomes. We set up to harvest polyribosomes from stimulated and unstimulated synaptoneurosomes to see which mRNAs were translated in response to glutamate."
4713,"About this time, Jim Eberwine told us about the mRNAs he had isolated from single dendrites. We looked for their translation in our new system, and the first one that was increased by stimulation turned out to be the fragile X mental retardation protein. This has led us to study brain abnormalities in fragile X syndrome, the largest cause of inherited mental retardation."
4714,"Do we now, at last, have a “memory protein”? Not yet, because FMRP is not a structural or receptor protein, but a protein that binds mRNA. It seems to orchestrate the translation of an impressive array of other mRNAs, few of which, at first glance, look like “memory proteins.” But, if FMRP is a key to how the synapse changes itself, then we think we are still on the right track to understand synaptic remodeling. Indeed, people with fragile X syndrome have immature-appearing synapses. So we have been wrong a lot of the time and frustrated on a near-weekly basis."
4715,"Nature is full of surprises, but we have increased our understanding of synaptic protein synthesis. Indeed, we are now asking new questions that may help us understand and possibly treat the leading inherited form of mental retardation. It was worth the effort."
4716,"For the most part, the cytoplasm of dendrites resembles that of axons. It is filled with cytoskeletal elements and mitochondria. One interesting difference was discovered by neuroscientist Oswald Steward."
4717,"He found that polyribosomes can be observed in dendrites, often right under spines. Steward’s research suggests that synaptic transmission can actually direct local protein synthesis in some neurons. In Chapter 25, we will see that synaptic regulation of protein synthesis is crucial for information storage by the brain."
4718,"It is unlikely that we can ever hope to understand how each of the hundred billion neurons in the nervous system uniquely contributes to the function of the brain. But what if we could show that all the neurons in the brain can be divided into a small number of categories, and that within each category, all neurons function identically? The complexity of the problem might then be reduced to understanding the unique contribution of each category, rather than each cell."
4719,It is with this hope that neuroscientists have devised schemes for classifying neurons. Neurons can be classified according to the total number of neurites that extend from the soma. A neuron that has a single neurite is said to be unipolar.
4720,"If there are two neurites, the cell is bipolar, and if there are three or more, the cell is multipolar. Most neurons in the brain are multipolar. Dendritic trees can vary widely from one type of neuron to another."
4721,"Some have inspired elegant names like ""double bouquet cells."" Others have less interesting names, such as ""alpha cells."" Classification is often unique to a particular part of the brain."
4722,"For example, in the cerebral cortex, there are two broad classes: stellate cells and pyramidal cells. Another simple way to classify neurons is according to whether their dendrites have spines. Those that do are called spiny, and those that do not are called aspinous."
4723,"These dendritic classification schemes can overlap. For example, in the cerebral cortex, all pyramidal cells are spiny. Stellate cells, on the other hand, can be either spiny or aspinous."
4724,"Information is delivered to the nervous system by neurons that have neurites in the sensory surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the retina of the eye. Cells with these connections are called primary sensory neurons. Other neurons have axons that form synapses with the muscles and command movements; these are called motor neurons."
4725,"But most neurons in the nervous system form connections only with other neurons. According to this classification scheme, these cells are all called interneurons. Some neurons have long axons that extend from one part of the brain to the other; these are called Golgi type I neurons or projection neurons."
4726,"Other neurons have short axons that do not extend beyond the vicinity of the cell body; these are called Golgi type II neurons or local circuit neurons. In the cerebral cortex, for example, pyramidal cells usually have long axons that extend to other parts of the brain and are therefore Golgi type I neurons. In contrast, stellate cells have axons that never extend beyond the cerebral cortex and are therefore Golgi type II neurons."
4727,"The classification schemes presented so far are based on the morphology of neurons as revealed by a Golgi stain. Newer methods that enable neuroscientists to identify which neurons contain specific neurotransmitters have resulted in a scheme for classifying neurons based on their chemistry. For example, the motor neurons that command voluntary movements all release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at their synapses."
4728,"These cells are therefore also classified as cholinergic, meaning that they use this particular neurotransmitter. Collections of cells that use a common neurotransmitter make up the brain’s neurotransmitter systems. We have devoted most of our attention in this chapter to the neurons."
4729,"While this decision is justified by the state of current knowledge, some neuroscientists consider glia to be the “sleeping giants” of neuroscience. One day, they suppose, it will be shown that glia contribute much more significantly to information processing in the brain than is currently appreciated. At present, however, the evidence indicates that glia contribute to brain function mainly by supporting neuronal functions."
4730,"Although their role may be subordinate, without glia, the brain could not function properly. The most numerous glia in the brain are called astrocytes. These cells fill the spaces between neurons."
4731,"The space that remains between the neurons and the astrocytes in the brain measures only about 20 nm wide. Consequently, astrocytes probably influence whether a neurite can grow or retract. When we speak of fluid “bathing” neurons in the brain, it is more like soaking from a hose than immersion in a swimming pool."
4732,"An essential role of astrocytes is regulating the chemical content of this extracellular space. For example, astrocytes envelop synaptic junctions in the brain, thereby restricting the spread of neurotransmitter molecules that have been released. Astrocytes also have special proteins in their membranes that actively remove many neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft."
4733,"A recent and unexpected discovery is that astrocytic membranes also possess neurotransmitter receptors that, like the receptors on neurons, can trigger electrical and biochemical events inside the glial cell. Besides regulating neurotransmitters, astrocytes also tightly control the extracellular concentration of several substances that have the potential to interfere with proper neuronal function. For example, astrocytes regulate the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid."
4734,"Unlike astrocytes, the primary function of oligodendroglial and Schwann cells is clear. These glia provide layers of membrane that insulate axons. Boston University anatomist Alan Peters, a pioneer in the electron microscopic study of the nervous system, showed that this wrapping, called myelin, spirals around axons in the brain."
4735,"Because the axon fits inside the spiral wrapping like a sword in its scabbard, the name myelin sheath describes the entire covering. The sheath is interrupted periodically, leaving a short length where the axonal membrane is exposed. This region is called a node of Ranvier."
4736,"We will see in Chapter 4 that myelin serves to speed the propagation of nerve impulses down the axon. Oligodendroglia and Schwann cells differ in their location and some other characteristics. For example, oligodendroglia are found only in the central nervous system, while Schwann cells are found only in the peripheral nervous system."
4737,"Another difference is that one oligodendroglial cell will contribute myelin to several axons, while each Schwann cell myelinates only a single axon. Even if we eliminated every neuron, every astrocyte, and every oligodendroglial cell, other cells would still remain in the brain. For the sake of completeness, we must mention these other cells."
4738,"First, special cells called ependymal cells provide the lining of fluid-filled ventricles within the brain, and they also play a role in directing cell migration during brain development. Second, a class of cells called microglia functions as phagocytes to remove debris left by dead or degenerating neurons and glia. Finally, the vasculature of the brain—arteries, veins, and capillaries—would still be there."
4739,"Learning about the structural characteristics of the neuron provides insight into how neurons and their different parts work, because structure correlates with function. For example, the absence of ribosomes in the axon correctly predicts that proteins in the axon terminal must be provided by the soma via axoplasmic transport. A large number of mitochondria in the axon terminal correctly predicts a high energy demand."
4740,"The elaborate structure of the dendritic tree appears ideally suited for the receipt of incoming information, and indeed, this is where most of the synapses are formed with the axons of other neurons. Since the time of Nissl, it has been recognized that an important feature of neurons is the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). What does this tell us about neurons?"
4741,"We have said that rough ER is a site of the synthesis of proteins destined to be inserted into the membrane. We will now see how the various proteins in the neuronal membrane give rise to the unique capabilities of neurons to transmit, receive, and store information. Vision is remarkable—it lets us detect things as tiny and close as a mosquito on the tip of our nose, or as immense and far away as a galaxy near the fringes of the universe."
4742,"Sensitivity to light enables animals, including humans, to detect prey, predators, and mates. Based on the light reflected into our eyes from objects around us, we somehow make sense of a complex world. While this process seems effortless, it is, in reality, extremely complicated."
4743,"Indeed, it has proven quite difficult to create computer visual systems with even a small fraction of the capabilities of the human visual system. Light is electromagnetic energy that is emitted in the form of waves. We live in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic radiation."
4744,"Like any ocean, this sea has large waves and small waves, short wavelets and long rollers. The waves crash into objects and are absorbed, scattered, reflected, and bent. Because of the nature of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with the environment, the visual system can extract information about the world."
4745,"This is a big job, and it requires a lot of neural machinery. However, the mastery of vision over the course of vertebrate evolution has had surprising rewards. It has provided new ways to communicate, given rise to brain mechanisms for predicting the trajectory of objects and events in time and space, allowed for new forms of mental imagery and abstraction, and led to the creation of a world of art."
4746,"The significance of vision is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that about half of the human cerebral cortex is involved in analyzing the visual world. The mammalian visual system begins with the eye. At the back of the eye is the retina, which contains photoreceptors specialized to convert light energy into neural activity."
4747,"The rest of the eye acts like a camera and forms crisp, clear images of the world on the retina. Like a camera, the eye automatically adjusts to differences in illumination and automatically focuses on objects of interest. The eye has some additional features not yet available on cameras, such as the ability to track moving objects and the ability to keep its transparent surfaces clean."
4748,"While much of the eye functions like a camera, the retina is much more than film. In fact, the retina is actually part of the brain. In a sense, each eye has two overlapping retinas: one specialized for low light levels that we encounter from dusk to dawn, and another specialized for higher light levels and for the detection of color, from sunrise to sunset."
4749,"Regardless of the time of day, however, the output of the retina is not a faithful reproduction of the intensity of the light falling on it. Rather, the retina is specialized to detect differences in the intensity of light falling on different parts of it. Image processing is well underway in the retina before any visual information reaches the rest of the brain."
4750,"Axons of retinal neurons are bundled into optic nerves, which distribute visual information to several brain structures that perform different functions. Some targets of the optic nerves are involved in regulating biological rhythms, which are synchronized with the light-dark daily cycle; others are involved in the control of eye position and optics. However, the first synaptic relay in the pathway that serves visual perception occurs in a cell group of the dorsal thalamus called the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN."
4751,"From the LGN, visual information ascends to the cerebral cortex, where it is interpreted and remembered. In this chapter, we explore the eye and the retina. We will see how light carries information to our visual system, how the eye forms images on the retina, and how the retina converts light energy into neural signals that can be used to extract information about luminance and color differences."
4752,"In the next chapter, we will pick up the visual pathway at the back of the eye and take it through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. The visual system uses light to form images of the world around us. Let’s briefly review the physical properties of light and its interactions with the environment."
4753,"Electromagnetic radiation is all around us. It comes from innumerable sources, including radio antennas, mobile phones, X-ray machines, and the sun. Light is the electromagnetic radiation that is visible to our eyes."
4754,"Electromagnetic radiation can be described as a wave of energy. Like any wave, electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength, the distance between successive peaks or troughs; a frequency, the number of waves per second; and an amplitude, the difference between wave trough and peak. The energy content of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to its frequency."
4755,"Radiation emitted at a high frequency has the highest energy content; examples are gamma radiation emitted by some radioactive materials and X-rays used for medical imaging, with wavelengths less than 10 m. Conversely, radiation emitted at lower frequencies has less energy; examples are radar and radio waves, with wavelengths greater than 1 mm. Only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum is detectable by our visual system; visible light consists of wavelengths of 400–700 nm."
4756,"As first shown by Isaac Newton early in the eighteenth century, the mix of wavelengths in this range emitted by the sun appears to humans as white, whereas light of a single wavelength appears as one of the colors of the rainbow. It is interesting to note that a “hot” color like red or orange consists of light with a longer wavelength and hence has less energy than a “cool” color like blue or violet. Clearly, colors are themselves “colored” by the brain, based on our subjective experiences."
4757,"In a vacuum, a wave of electromagnetic radiation will travel in a straight line and thus can be described as a ray. Light rays in our environment also travel in straight lines until they interact with the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere and objects on the ground. These interactions include reflection, absorption, and refraction."
4758,The study of light rays and their interactions is called optics. Reflection is the bouncing of light rays off a surface. The manner in which a ray of light is reflected depends on the angle at which it strikes the surface.
4759,"A ray striking a mirror perpendicularly is reflected 180° back upon itself, while a ray striking the mirror at a 45° angle is reflected 90°, and so on. Most of what we see is light that has been reflected off objects in our environment. Absorption is the transfer of light energy to a particle or surface."
4760,"You can feel this energy transfer on your skin on a sunny day, as visible light is absorbed and warms you up. Surfaces that appear black absorb the energy of all visible wavelengths. Some compounds absorb light energy only in a limited range of wavelengths, then reflect the remaining wavelengths."
4761,"This property is the basis for the colored pigments of paints. For example, a blue pigment absorbs long wavelengths but reflects a range of short wavelengths centered on 430 nm that are perceived as blue. As we will see in a moment, light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the retina contain pigments and use the energy absorbed from light to generate changes in membrane potential."
4762,"Images are formed in the eye by refraction, the bending of light rays that can occur when they travel from one transparent medium to another. Consider a ray of light passing from the air into a pool of water. If the ray strikes the water surface perpendicularly, it will pass through in a straight line."
4763,"However, if light strikes the surface at an angle, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the surface. This bending of light occurs because the speed of light differs in the two media; light passes through air more rapidly than through water. The greater the difference between the speed of light in the two media, the greater the angle of refraction."
4764,"The transparent media in the eye bend light rays to form images on the retina. The eye is an organ specialized for the detection, localization, and analysis of light. Here we introduce the structure of this remarkable organ in terms of its gross anatomy, ophthalmoscopic appearance, and cross-sectional anatomy."
4765,"When you look into someone’s eyes, what are you really looking at? The main structures are shown in Figure 9.4."
4766,"The pupil is the opening that allows light to enter the eye and reach the retina; it appears dark because of the light-absorbing pigments in the retina. The pupil is surrounded by the iris, whose pigmentation provides what we call the eye’s color. The iris contains two muscles that can vary the size of the pupil; one makes it smaller when it contracts, while the other makes it larger."
4767,"The pupil and iris are covered by the glassy transparent external surface of the eye, the cornea. The cornea is continuous with the sclera, the ""white of the eye,"" which forms the tough wall of the eyeball. The eyeball sits in a bony eye socket in the skull, also called the eye’s orbit."
4768,"Inserted into the sclera are three pairs of extraocular muscles, which move the eyeball in the orbit. These muscles are normally not visible because they lie behind the conjunctiva, a membrane that folds back from the inside of the eyelids and attaches to the sclera. The optic nerve, carrying axons from the retina, exits the back of the eye, passes through the orbit, and reaches the base of the brain near the pituitary gland."
4769,"Another view of the eye is afforded by the ophthalmoscope, a device that enables one to peer into the eye through the pupil to the retina. The most obvious feature of the retina viewed through an ophthalmoscope is the blood vessels on its surface. These retinal vessels originate from a pale circular region called the optic disk, which is also where the optic nerve fibers exit the retina."
4770,"It is interesting to note that the sensation of light cannot occur at the optic disk because there are no photoreceptors here, nor can it occur where the large blood vessels exist because the vessels cast shadows on the retina. And yet, our perception of the visual world appears seamless. We are not aware of any holes in our field of vision because the brain fills in our perception of these areas."
4771,"However, there are tricks by which we can demonstrate the ""blind"" retinal regions. At the middle of each retina is a darker-colored region with a yellowish hue. This is the macula, the part of the retina for central vision."
4772,"Besides its color, the macula is distinguished by the relative absence of large blood vessels. Notice that the vessels arc from the optic disk to the macula; this is also the trajectory of the optic nerve fibers from the macula en route to the optic disk."
4773,"The relative absence of large blood vessels in this region of the retina is one of the specializations that improves the quality of central vision. Another specialization of the central retina can sometimes be discerned with the ophthalmoscope: the fovea, a dark spot about 2 mm in diameter. The term is from the Latin for ""pit,"" and the retina is thinner in the fovea than elsewhere."
4774,"Because it marks the center of the retina, the fovea is a convenient anatomical reference point. Thus, the part of the retina that lies closer to the nose than the fovea is called nasal, the part that lies near the temple is called temporal, the part of the retina above the fovea is called superior, and that below it is called inferior. A look through an ophthalmoscope reveals that there is a sizable hole in the retina."
4775,"The region where the optic nerve axons exit the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter the eye, the optic disk, is completely devoid of photoreceptors. Moreover, the blood vessels coursing across the retina are opaque and block the light from falling on photoreceptors beneath them. Although we normally don’t notice them, these blind regions can be demonstrated."
4776,"Look at the figure. Hold the book about 1.5 ft away, close your right eye, and fixate on the cross with your left eye."
4777,"Move the book around slightly, and eventually you will find a position where the black circle disappears. At this position, the spot is imaged on the optic disk of the left eye. This region of visual space is called the blind spot for the left eye."
4778,"The blood vessels are a little tricky to demonstrate, but give this a try. Get a standard household flashlight. In a dark or dimly lit room, close your left eye."
4779,"Look straight ahead with the open right eye, and shine the flashlight at an angle into the corner of the eye from the side. Jiggle the light back and forth, up and down. If you’re lucky, you’ll see an image of your own retinal blood vessels."
4780,"This is possible because the illumination of the eye at this oblique angle causes the retinal blood vessels to cast long shadows on the adjacent regions of the retina. For the shadows to be visible, they must be swept back and forth on the retina, hence the jiggling of the light. If we have all these light-insensitive regions in the retina, why does the visual world appear uninterrupted and seamless?"
4781,The answer is that mechanisms in the visual cortex appear to “fill in” the missing regions. Perceptual filling-in can be demonstrated with the stimulus shown. Fixate on the cross with your left eye and move the book closer and farther from your eye.
4782,"You’ll find a distance at which you will see a continuous, uninterrupted line. At this point, the space in the line is imaged on the blind spot, and your brain fills in the gap. A cross-sectional view of the eye shows the path taken by light as it passes through the cornea toward the retina."
4783,"The cornea lacks blood vessels and is nourished by the fluid behind it, the aqueous humor. This view reveals the transparent lens located behind the iris. The lens is suspended by ligaments attached to the ciliary muscles, which are attached to the sclera and form a ring inside the eye."
4784,"As we shall see, changes in the shape of the lens enable our eyes to adjust their focus to different viewing distances. The lens also divides the interior of the eye into two compartments containing slightly different fluids. The aqueous humor is the watery fluid that lies between the cornea and the lens."
4785,"The more viscous, jellylike vitreous humor lies between the lens and the retina; its pressure serves to keep the eyeball spherical. Although the eyes do a remarkable job of delivering precise visual information to the rest of the brain, a variety of disorders can compromise this ability. The eye collects the light rays emitted by or reflected off objects in the environment and focuses them onto the retina to form images."
4786,"Bringing objects into focus involves the combined refractive powers of the cornea and lens. You may be surprised to learn that the cornea, rather than the lens, is the site of most of the refractive power of the eyes. Consider the light emitted from a distant source, perhaps a bright star at night."
4787,"We see the star as a point of light because the eye focuses the star’s light to a point on the retina. The light rays striking the surface of the eye from a distant star are virtually parallel, so they must be bent by the process of refraction. Recall that as light passes into a medium where its speed is slowed, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the border, or interface, between the media."
4788,This is precisely the situation as light strikes the cornea and passes from the air into the aqueous humor. The light rays that strike the curved surface of the cornea bend so that they converge on the back of the eye; those that enter the center of the eye pass straight to the retina.
4789,"The distance from the refractive surface to the point where parallel light rays converge is called the focal distance. Focal distance depends on the curvature of the cornea—the tighter the curve, the shorter the focal distance. The reciprocal of the focal distance in meters is a unit of measurement called the diopter. The cornea has a refractive power of about 42 diopters, which means that parallel light rays striking the corneal surface will be focused 0.024 m behind it, about the distance from the cornea to the retina."
4790,"To get a sense of the large amount of refraction produced by the cornea, note that many prescription eyeglasses have a power of only a few diopters. Remember that refractive power depends on the slowing of light at the air-cornea interface. If we replace air with a medium that passes light at about the same speed as the eye, the refractive power of the cornea will be eliminated."
4791,"This is why things look blurry when you open your eyes underwater; the water-cornea interface has very little focusing power. A scuba mask restores the air-cornea interface and, consequently, the refractive power of the eye. Although the cornea performs most of the eye’s refraction, the lens also contributes another dozen or so diopters to the formation of a sharp image at a distant point."
4792,"However, the lens is more importantly involved in forming crisp images of objects located closer than about 9 m from the eye. As objects approach, the light rays originating from a point can no longer be considered parallel. Rather, these rays diverge, and greater refractive power is required to bring them into focus on the retina."
4793,"This additional focusing power is provided by changing the shape of the lens, a process called accommodation. Once you know the basic structure of the eye, you can understand how a partial or complete loss of vision results from abnormalities in various components. For example, if there is an imbalance in the extraocular muscles of the two eyes, the eyes will point in different directions."
4794,"Such a misalignment or lack of coordination between the two eyes is called strabismus, and there are two varieties. In esotropia, the directions of gaze of the two eyes cross, and the person is said to be cross-eyed. In exotropia, the directions of gaze diverge, and the person is said to be walleyed."
4795,"In most cases, strabismus of either type is congenital; it can and should be corrected during early childhood. Treatment usually involves the use of prismatic glasses or surgery to the extraocular muscles to realign the eyes. Without treatment, conflicting images are sent to the brain from the two eyes, degrading depth perception and, more importantly, causing the person to suppress input from one eye."
4796,"The dominant eye will be normal, but the suppressed eye will become amblyopic, meaning that it has poor visual acuity. If medical intervention is delayed until adulthood, the condition cannot be corrected. A common eye disorder among older adults is cataract, a clouding of the lens."
4797,"Many people over 65 years of age have some degree of cataract; if it significantly impairs vision, surgery is usually required. In a cataract operation, the lens is removed and replaced with an artificial plastic lens. Although the artificial lens cannot adjust its focus like the normal lens, it provides a clear image, and glasses can be used for near and far vision."
4798,"Glaucoma, a progressive loss of vision associated with elevated intraocular pressure, is a leading cause of blindness. Pressure in the aqueous humor plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape of the eye. As this pressure increases, the entire eye is stressed, ultimately damaging the relatively weak point where the optic nerve leaves the eye."
4799,"The optic nerve axons are compressed, and vision is gradually lost from the periphery inward. Unfortunately, by the time a person notices a loss of more central vision, the damage is advanced, and a significant portion of the eye is permanently blind. For this reason, early detection and treatment with medication or surgery to reduce intraocular pressure are essential."
4800,"The light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye is the site of numerous disorders that pose a significant risk of blindness. You may have heard of a professional boxer having a detached retina. As the name implies, the retina pulls away from the underlying wall of the eye due to a blow to the head or by shrinkage of the vitreous humor."
4801,"Once the retina has started to detach, fluid from the vitreous space flows through small tears in the retina resulting from the trauma, causing more of the retina to separate. Symptoms of retinal detachment include abnormal perception of shadows and flashes of light. Treatment often involves laser surgery to scar the edge of the retinal tear, thereby reattaching the retina to the back of the eye."
4802,"Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors. The first sign is usually a loss of peripheral vision and night vision. Subsequently, total blindness may result."
4803,"The cause of this disease is unknown. In some forms, it clearly has a strong genetic component, and more than 100 genes have been identified that can contain mutations leading to retinitis pigmentosa. Currently, there is no cure, but taking vitamin A may slow its progression."
4804,"In contrast to the tunnel vision typically experienced by patients with retinitis pigmentosa, people with macular degeneration lose only central vision. The condition is quite common, affecting more than 25% of all Americans over 65 years of age. While peripheral vision usually remains normal, the ability to read, watch television, and recognize faces is lost as central photoreceptors gradually deteriorate."
4805,"Laser surgery can sometimes minimize further vision loss, but the disease currently has no known cure. When the ciliary muscles are relaxed and the lens is flat, the eye is said to be emmetropic if parallel light rays from a distant point source are focused sharply on the back of the retina. Stated another way, the emmetropic eye focuses parallel light rays on the retina without the need for accommodation."
4806,"Now consider what happens when the eyeball is too short from front to back. The light rays are focused at some point behind the retina, and the image of a point of light is a blurry spot on the retina. This condition is known as hyperopia, or farsightedness, because the eye can focus on far objects, but the lens cannot accommodate enough to form an image on near points."
4807,"Farsightedness can be corrected by placing a convex glass or plastic lens in front of the eye. The curved front edge of the lens, like the cornea, bends light toward the center of the retina. Also, as the light passes from glass into air as it exits the lens, the back of the lens also increases the refraction."
4808,"If the eyeball is too long rather than too short, parallel rays will converge before the retina, cross, and again be imaged on the retina as a blurry circle. This condition is known as myopia, or nearsightedness. The amount of refraction provided by the cornea and lens is too great to focus on distant objects."
4809,"Thus, for the nearsighted eye to see distant points clearly, artificial concave lenses must be used to move the point image back onto the retina. Some eyes have irregularities such that the curvature and refraction in the horizontal and vertical planes are different. This condition is called astigmatism, and it can be corrected by using an artificial lens that is curved more along one axis than others."
4810,"Even if you are fortunate enough to have perfectly shaped eyeballs and a symmetrical refractive system, you probably will not escape presbyopia. This condition is a hardening of the lens that accompanies the aging process and is thought to be explained by the fact that while new lens cells are generated throughout life, none are lost. The hardened lens is less elastic, leaving it unable to change shape and accommodate sufficiently to focus on both near and far objects."
4811,"The correction for presbyopia, first introduced by Benjamin Franklin, is a bifocal lens. These lenses are concave on top to assist far vision and convex on the bottom to assist near vision. In hyperopia and myopia, the amount of refraction provided by the cornea is either too little or too great for the length of the eyeball."
4812,"But modern techniques can now change the amount of refraction the cornea provides. In radial keratotomy, a procedure to correct myopia, tiny incisions through the peripheral portion of the cornea relax and flatten the central cornea, thus reducing the amount of refraction and minimizing myopia. The most recent techniques use lasers to reshape the cornea."
4813,"In photorefractive keratectomy, a laser is used to reshape the outer surface of the cornea by vaporizing thin layers. In laser in situ keratomileusis, a thin flap of the cornea is lifted so the laser can reshape the cornea from the inside. Nonsurgical methods are also being used to reshape the cornea."
4814,"A person can be fitted with special retainer contact lenses or plastic corneal rings, which alter the shape of the cornea and correct refractive errors. Recall that the ciliary muscle forms a ring around the lens. During accommodation, the ciliary muscle contracts and swells in size, thereby making the area inside the muscle smaller and decreasing the tension in the suspensory ligaments."
4815,"Consequently, the lens becomes rounder and thicker because of its natural elasticity. This rounding increases the curvature of the lens surfaces, thereby increasing their refractive power. Conversely, relaxation of the ciliary muscle increases the tension in the suspensory ligaments, and the lens is stretched into a flatter shape."
4816,"The ability to accommodate changes with age. An infant’s eyes can focus on objects just beyond his or her nose, whereas many middle-aged adults cannot clearly see objects closer than about arm’s length. Fortunately, artificial lenses can compensate for this and other defects of the eye’s optics."
4817,"In addition to the cornea and the lens, the pupil contributes to the optical functioning of the eye by continuously adjusting to different ambient light levels. To check this for yourself, stand in front of a bathroom mirror with the lights off for a few seconds, and then watch your pupils change size when you turn the lights on. This pupillary light reflex involves connections between the retina and neurons in the brainstem that control the muscles that constrict the pupils."
4818,"An interesting property of this reflex is that it is consensual; shining a light into only one eye causes the constriction of the pupils of both eyes. It is unusual, indeed, when the pupils are not the same size; the lack of a consensual pupillary light reflex is often taken as a sign of a serious neurological disorder involving the brainstem. Constriction of the pupil has the effect of increasing the depth of focus, just like decreasing the aperture size on a camera lens."
4819,"To understand why this is true, consider two points in space, one close and the other far away. When the eye accommodates to the closer point, the image of the farther point on the retina no longer forms a point, but rather a blurred circle. Decreasing the aperture—constricting the pupil—reduces the size of this blurred circle so that its image more closely approximates a point."
4820,"In this way, distant objects appear to be less out of focus. The structure of the eyes, and where they sit in our head, limits how much of the world we can see at any one time. Let’s investigate the extent of the space seen by one eye."
4821,"Holding a pencil in your right hand, close your left eye and look at a point straight ahead. Keeping your eye fixated on this point, slowly move the pencil to the right across your field of view until the pencil disappears. Repeat this exercise, moving the pencil to the left where it will disappear behind your nose, and then up and down."
4822,"The points where you can no longer see the pencil mark the limits of the visual field for your right eye. Now look at the middle of the pencil as you hold it horizontally in front of you. The light reflected off this pencil falls on your retina. Notice that the image is inverted; the left visual field is imaged on the right side of the retina, and the right visual field is imaged on the left side of the retina. The ability of the eye to distinguish two nearby points is called visual acuity."
4823,"Acuity depends on several factors, but especially on the spacing of photoreceptors in the retina and the precision of the eye’s refraction. Distance across the retina can be described in terms of degrees of visual angle. A right angle subtends 90°, and the moon, for example, subtends an angle of about 0.5°. We can speak of the eye’s ability to resolve points that are separated by a certain number of degrees of visual angle. The Snellen eye chart, which we have all read at the doctor’s office, tests our ability to discriminate letters and numbers at a viewing distance of 20 feet."
4824,"Your vision is 20/20 when you can recognize a letter that subtends an angle of 0.083°. Now that we have an image formed on the retina, we can get to the neuroscience of vision: the conversion of light energy into neural activity."
4825,"To begin our discussion of image processing in the retina, we must introduce the cellular architecture of this part of the brain. The basic system of retinal information processing is shown in Figure 9.11."
4826,"The most direct pathway for visual information to exit the eye is from photoreceptors to bipolar cells to ganglion cells. The ganglion cells fire action potentials in response to light, and these impulses propagate down the optic nerve to the rest of the brain. Besides the cells in this direct path from photoreceptors to the brain, retinal processing is influenced by two additional cell types."
4827,"Horizontal cells receive input from the photoreceptors and project neurites laterally to influence surrounding bipolar cells and photoreceptors. Amacrine cells receive input from bipolar cells and project laterally to influence surrounding ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and other amacrine cells. There are two important points to remember here: the only light-sensitive cells in the retina are the photoreceptors."
4828,All other cells are influenced by light only via direct and indirect synaptic interactions with the photoreceptors. The ganglion cells are the only source of output from the retina. No other retinal cell type projects an axon through the optic nerve.
4829,Now let’s take a look at how the different cell types are arranged in the retina. The retina has a laminar organization: cells are organized in layers. Notice that the layers are seemingly inside-out; light must pass from the vitreous humor through the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before it reaches the photoreceptors.
4830,"Because the retinal cells above the photoreceptors are relatively transparent, image distortion is minimal as light passes through them. One reason the inside-out arrangement is advantageous is that the pigmented epithelium that lies below the photoreceptors plays a critical role in the maintenance of the photoreceptors and photopigments. The pigmented epithelium also absorbs any light that passes entirely through the retina, thus minimizing the reflection of light within the eye that would blur the image."
4831,"The cell layers of the retina are named in reference to the middle of the eyeball. Thus, the innermost layer is the ganglion cell layer, which contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells. Next is the inner nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells."
4832,"The next layer is the outer nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the photoreceptors. Finally, the layer of photoreceptor outer segments contains the light-sensitive elements of the retina. The outer segments are embedded in the pigmented epithelium."
4833,"Between the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer is the inner plexiform layer, which contains the synaptic contacts between bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells. Between the outer and inner nuclear layers is the outer plexiform layer, where the photoreceptors make synaptic contact with the bipolar and horizontal cells. The conversion of electromagnetic radiation into neural signals occurs in the 125 million photoreceptors at the back of the retina."
4834,"Every photoreceptor has four regions: an outer segment, an inner segment, a cell body, and a synaptic terminal. The outer segment contains a stack of membranous disks. Light-sensitive photopigments in the disk membranes absorb light, thereby triggering changes in the photoreceptor membrane potential."
4835,"Figure 9.13 shows the two types of photoreceptors in the retina, easily distinguished by the appearance of their outer segments. Rod photoreceptors have a long, cylindrical outer segment containing many disks."
4836,"Cone photoreceptors have a shorter, tapering outer segment with fewer membranous disks. The structural differences between rods and cones correlate with important functional differences. For example, the greater number of disks and higher photopigment concentration in rods makes them over 1,000 times more sensitive to light than cones."
4837,"Indeed, under nighttime lighting, or scotopic conditions, only rods contribute to vision. Conversely, under daytime lighting, or photopic conditions, cones do the bulk of the work. For this reason, the retina is said to be duplex—a scotopic retina using only rods, and a photopic retina using mainly cones."
4838,"Rods and cones differ in other respects as well. All rods contain the same photopigment, but there are three types of cones, each containing a different pigment. The variations among pigments make the different cones sensitive to different wavelengths of light."
4839,"As we shall see in a moment, only the cones, not the rods, are responsible for our ability to see color. Retinal structure varies from the fovea to the retinal periphery. In general, the peripheral retina has a higher ratio of rods to cones."
4840,"It also has a higher ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells. The combined effect of this arrangement is that the peripheral retina is more sensitive to light, because rods are specialized for low light, and there are more photoreceptors feeding information to each ganglion cell. You can prove this to yourself on a starry night."
4841,"First, spend about 20 minutes in the dark getting oriented, and then gaze at a bright star. Fixating on this star, search your peripheral vision for a dim star. Then move your eyes to look at this dim star."
4842,"You will find that the faint star disappears when it is imaged on the central retina but reappears when it is imaged on the peripheral retina. The same characteristics that enable the peripheral retina to detect faint stars at night make it relatively poor at resolving fine details in daylight. This is because daytime vision requires cones, and good visual acuity requires a low ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells."
4843,"The region of the retina most highly specialized for high-resolution vision is the fovea. Recall that the fovea is a thinning of the retina at the center of the macula. In cross-section, the fovea appears as a pit in the retina."
4844,"Its pitlike appearance is due to the lateral displacement of the cells above the photoreceptors, allowing light to strike the photoreceptors without passing through the other retinal cell layers. This structural specialization maximizes visual acuity at the fovea by pushing aside other cells that might scatter light and blur the image. The central fovea is also unique because it contains no rods; all the photoreceptors are cones."
4845,"The photoreceptors convert, or transduce, light energy into changes in membrane potential. We begin our discussion of phototransduction with rods, which outnumber cones in the human retina by 20 to 1. Most of what has been learned about phototransduction by rods has proven to be applicable to cones as well."
4846,"As we discussed in Part I, one way information is represented in the nervous system is as changes in the membrane potential of neurons. Thus, we look for a mechanism by which the absorption of light energy can be transduced into a change in the photoreceptor membrane potential. In many respects, this process is analogous to the transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals that occurs during synaptic transmission."
4847,"At a G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptor, for example, the binding of the transmitter to the receptor activates G-proteins in the membrane, which in turn stimulate various effector enzymes. These enzymes alter the intracellular concentration of cytoplasmic second messenger molecules, which change the conductance of membrane ion channels, thereby altering membrane potential. Similarly, in the photoreceptor, light stimulation of the photopigment activates G-proteins, which in turn activate an effector enzyme that changes the cytoplasmic concentration of a second messenger molecule."
4848,"This change causes a membrane ion channel to close, and the membrane potential is thereby altered. Recall that a typical neuron at rest has a membrane potential of about -65 mV, close to the equilibrium potential for K. In contrast, in complete darkness, the membrane potential of the rod outer segment is about -30 mV."
4849,"This depolarization is caused by the steady influx of Na through special channels in the outer segment membrane. The movement of positive charge across the membrane, which occurs in the dark, is called the dark current. Sodium channels are stimulated to open—are gated—by an intracellular second messenger called cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP."
4850,"Evidently, cGMP is continually produced in the photoreceptor by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, keeping the Na channels open. Light reduces cGMP, causing the Na channels to close, and the membrane potential becomes more negative. Thus, photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light."
4851,"The hyperpolarizing response to light is initiated by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the photopigment in the membrane of the stacked disks in the rod outer segments. In the rods, this pigment is called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin can be thought of as a receptor protein with a prebound chemical agonist."
4852,"The receptor protein is called opsin, and it has the seven transmembrane alpha helices typical of G-protein-coupled receptors throughout the body. The prebound agonist is called retinal, a derivative of vitamin A. The absorption of light causes a change in the conformation of retinal so that it activates the opsin."
4853,"This process is called bleaching because it changes the wavelengths absorbed by the rhodopsin. The bleaching of rhodopsin stimulates a G-protein called transducin in the disk membrane, which in turn activates the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase, which breaks down the cGMP that is normally present in the cytoplasm of the rod. The reduction in cGMP causes the Na channels to close and the membrane to hyperpolarize."
4854,"One of the interesting functional consequences of using a biochemical cascade for transduction is signal amplification. Many G-proteins are activated by each photopigment molecule, and each PDE enzyme breaks down more than one cGMP molecule. This amplification gives our visual system the ability to detect as little as a single photon, the elementary unit of light energy."
4855,"The complete sequence of events of phototransduction in rods is illustrated. In bright sunlight, cGMP levels in rods fall to the point where the response to light becomes saturated; additional light causes no more hyperpolarization. Thus, vision during the day depends entirely on the cones, whose photopigments require more energy to become bleached."
4856,"The process of phototransduction in cones is virtually the same as in rods; the only major difference is in the type of opsins in the membranous disks of the cone outer segments. The cones in our retinas contain one of three opsins that give the photopigments different spectral sensitivities. Thus, we can speak of “blue” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 430 nm, “green” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 530 nm, and “red” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 560 nm."
4857,"Color detection. The color that we perceive is largely determined by the relative contributions of blue, green, and red cones to the retinal signal. The fact that our visual system detects colors in this way was actually predicted almost 200 years ago by British physicist Thomas Young."
4858,"Young showed in 1802 that all the colors of the rainbow, including white, could be created by mixing the proper ratio of red, green, and blue light. He proposed, quite correctly, that at each point in the retina there exists a cluster of three receptor types, each type being maximally sensitive to either blue, green, or red. Young’s ideas were later championed by Hermann von Helmholtz, an influential nineteenth-century German physiologist."
4859,"This theory of color vision came to be known as the Young-Helmholtz trichromacy theory. According to the theory, the brain assigns colors based on a comparison of the readout of the three cone types. When all types of cones are equally active, as in broad-spectrum light, we perceive “white.” Various forms of color blindness result when one or more of the cone photopigment types is missing. If cones alone make the perception of color possible, we should be unable to perceive color differences when cones are inactive. This inference is correct, and you can demonstrate it to yourself."
4860,"Go outside on a dark night and try to distinguish the colors of different objects. It is difficult to detect colors at night because only the rods, with a single type of photopigment, are activated under dim lighting conditions. The peak sensitivity of the rods is to a wavelength of about 500 nm, perceived as blue-green."
4861,"This fact is the basis for two points of view about the design of automobile dashboard indicator lights. One view is that the lights should be dim blue-green to take advantage of the spectral sensitivity of the rods. An alternate view is that the lights should be bright red because this wavelength affects mainly cones, leaving the rods unsaturated, resulting in better night vision."
4862,"This transition from all-cone daytime vision to all-rod nighttime vision is not instantaneous; it takes about 20–25 minutes. This phenomenon is called dark adaptation, or getting used to the dark. Sensitivity to light actually increases a millionfold or more during this period."
4863,"Dark adaptation is explained by a number of factors. Perhaps the most obvious is dilation of the pupils, which allows more light to enter the eye. However, the diameter of the human pupil only ranges from about 2–8 mm, meaning that changes in its size can increase the pupil area by a factor of only 16."
4864,"The larger component of dark adaptation involves the regeneration of unbleached rhodopsin and an adjustment of the functional circuitry of the retina so that information from more rods is available to each ganglion cell. Because of this tremendous increase in sensitivity, when the dark-adapted eye goes back into bright light, it is temporarily saturated. This explains what happens when you first go outside on a bright day."
4865,"Over the next 5–10 minutes, the eyes undergo light adaptation, reversing the changes in the retina that accompanied dark adaptation. This light-dark adaptation in the duplex retina gives our visual system the ability to operate in light intensities ranging from moonless midnight to bright high noon."
4866,"In addition to the factors mentioned above, the ability of the eye to adapt to changes in light level relies on changes in calcium concentration within the cones. When you step out into bright light from a dark theater, initially, the cones are hyperpolarized as much as possible. If the cones stayed in this state, we would be unable to see changes in light level."
4867,"As discussed above, the constriction of the pupil helps a bit in reducing the light entering the eye. However, the most important change is a gradual depolarization of the membrane back to about -35 mV. The reason this happens stems from the fact that the cGMP-gated sodium channels also admit calcium."
4868,"In the dark, Ca²⁺ enters the cones and has an inhibitory effect on the enzyme that synthesizes cGMP. When the cGMP-gated channels close, the flow of Ca²⁺ into the photoreceptor is curtailed; as a result, more cGMP is synthesized, thereby allowing the cGMP-gated channels to open again. Stated more simply, when the channels close, a process is initiated that gradually reopens them even if the light level does not change."
4869,"Calcium also appears to affect photopigments and phosphodiesterase in ways that decrease their response to light. These calcium-based mechanisms ensure that the photoreceptors are always able to register relative changes in light level, though information about the absolute level is lost. The color we perceive is largely determined by the relative amounts of light absorbed by the red, green, and blue visual pigments in our cones."
4870,"This means it’s possible to perceive any color of the rainbow by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light. For example, the perception of yellow light can be matched by an appropriate mixture of red and green light. Because we use a ""three-color"" system, humans are referred to as trichromats."
4871,"However, not all normal trichromats perceive colors exactly the same. For example, if a group of people are asked to choose the wavelength of light that most appears green without being yellowish or bluish, there will be small variations in the choices. However, significant abnormalities of color vision extend well beyond this range of normal trichromatic vision."
4872,"Most abnormalities in color vision are the result of small genetic errors that lead to the loss of one visual pigment or a shift in the spectral sensitivity of one type of pigment. The most common abnormalities involve red-green color vision, and they are much more common in men than women. The reason for this pattern is that the genes encoding the red and green pigments are on the X chromosome, whereas the gene that encodes the blue pigment is on chromosome 7."
4873,Men will have abnormal red-green vision if there is a defect on the single X chromosome they inherit from their mother. Women will have abnormal red-green vision only if both parents contribute abnormal X chromosomes. About 6% of men have a red or green pigment that absorbs somewhat different wavelengths of light than the pigments of the rest of the population.
4874,"These men are referred to as anomalous trichromats because they require somewhat different mixtures of red, green, and blue to see intermediate colors than other people do. Most anomalous trichromats have normal genes to encode the blue pigment and either the red or the green pigment, but they also have a hybrid gene that encodes a protein with an abnormal absorption spectrum between that of normal red and green pigments. For example, a person with an anomalous green pigment can match a yellow light with a red-green mixture containing less red than a normal trichromat."
4875,"Anomalous trichromats perceive the full spectrum of colors that normal trichromats perceive, but in rare instances, they will disagree about the precise color of an object. About 2% of men actually lack either the red or the green pigment, making them red-green color-blind. Because this leaves them with a “two-color” system, they are referred to as dichromats."
4876,"People lacking the green pigment are less sensitive to green, and they confuse certain red and green colors that appear different to trichromats. A “green dichromat” can match a yellow light with either red or green light; no mixture is needed. In contrast to the roughly 8% of men that are either missing one pigment or have an anomalous pigment, only about 1% of women have such color abnormalities."
4877,"People without one color pigment are considered colorblind, but they actually perceive quite a colorful world. Estimates of the number of people lacking all color vision vary, but less than about 0.001% of the population is thought to have this condition."
4878,"In one type, both red and green cone pigments are missing, in many cases because mutations of the red and green genes make them nonfunctional. These people are blue cone monochromats, and they live in a world that varies only in lightness, like a trichromat’s perception of a black-and-white movie. Recent research has shown that, precisely speaking, there may not be such a thing as normal color vision."
4879,"In a group of males classified as normal trichromats, it was found that some require slightly more red than others to perceive yellow in a red-green mixture. This difference, which is tiny compared to the deficits discussed above, results from a single alteration of the red pigment gene. The 60% of males who have the amino acid serine at site 180 in the red pigment gene are more sensitive to long-wavelength light than the 40% who have the amino acid alanine at this site."
4880,"Imagine what would happen if a woman had different red gene varieties on her two X chromosomes. Both red genes should be expressed, leading to different red pigments in two populations of cones. In principle, such women should have a form of tetrachromatic color vision, a rarity among all animals."
4881,"Well before the discovery of how photoreceptors work, researchers were able to explain some of the ways the retina processes visual images. Since about 1950, neuroscientists have studied the action potential discharges of retinal ganglion cells as the retina is stimulated with light. The pioneers of this approach were neurophysiologists Keffer Hartline, Stephen Kuffler, and Horace Barlow, with Hartline and Kuffler working in the United States and Barlow working in England."
4882,Their research uncovered which aspects of a visual image were encoded as ganglion cell output. Early studies of horseshoe crabs and frogs gave way to investigations of cats and monkeys. Researchers learned that similar principles are involved in retinal processing across a wide range of species.
4883,"Progress in understanding how ganglion cell properties are generated by synaptic interactions in the retina has been slower. This is because only ganglion cells fire action potentials; all other cells in the retina respond to stimulation with graded changes in membrane potential. The detection of such graded changes requires technically challenging intracellular recording methods, whereas action potentials can be detected using simple extracellular recording methods."
4884,"It was not until the early 1970s that John Dowling and Frank Werblin at Harvard University were able to show how ganglion cell responses are built from the interactions of horizontal and bipolar cells. The most direct path for information flow in the retina is from a cone photoreceptor to a bipolar cell to a ganglion cell. At each synaptic relay, the responses are modified by the lateral connections of horizontal cells and amacrine cells."
4885,"We first focus on how information is transformed as it passes from photoreceptors to bipolar cells and then explore ganglion cell output in the last section. Photoreceptors, like other neurons, release neurotransmitter when depolarized. The transmitter released by photoreceptors is the amino acid glutamate."
4886,"As we have seen, photoreceptors are depolarized in the dark and are hyperpolarized by light. We thus have the counterintuitive situation in which photoreceptors actually release fewer transmitter molecules in the light than in the dark. However, we can reconcile this apparent paradox if we take the point of view that dark rather than light is the preferred stimulus for a photoreceptor."
4887,"Thus, when a shadow passes across a photoreceptor, it responds by depolarizing and releasing neurotransmitter. In the outer plexiform layer, each photoreceptor is in synaptic contact with two types of retinal neurons: bipolar cells and horizontal cells. Recall that bipolar cells create the direct pathway from photoreceptors to ganglion cells; horizontal cells feed information laterally in the outer plexiform layer to influence the activity of neighboring bipolar cells and photoreceptors."
4888,"Bipolar Cell Receptive Fields. Bipolar cells can be categorized into two classes based on their responses to the glutamate released by photoreceptors. In OFF bipolar cells, glutamate-gated cation channels mediate a classical depolarizing EPSP from the influx of Na⁺."
4889,ON bipolar cells have G-protein-coupled receptors and respond to glutamate by hyperpolarizing. Notice that the names OFF and ON refer to whether these cells depolarize in response to light off or to light on. Each bipolar cell receives direct synaptic input from a cluster of photoreceptors.
4890,"The number of photoreceptors in this cluster ranges from one at the center of the fovea to thousands in the peripheral retina. In addition to these direct connections with photoreceptors, bipolar cells are also connected via horizontal cells to a circumscribed ring of photoreceptors that surrounds this central cluster. The receptive field of a bipolar cell is the area of the retina that, when stimulated with light, changes the cell’s membrane potential."
4891,"The receptive field of a bipolar cell consists of two parts: a circular area of retina providing direct photoreceptor input, called the receptive field center, and a surrounding area of retina providing input via horizontal cells, called the receptive field surround. Receptive field dimensions can be measured in millimeters across the retina or, more commonly, in degrees of visual angle. One millimeter on the retina corresponds to a visual angle of about 3.5°. Bipolar cell receptive field diameters range from a fraction of a degree in the central retina to several degrees in the peripheral retina. The response of a bipolar cell’s membrane potential to light in the receptive field center is opposite to that of light in the surround."
4892,"For example, if illumination of the center causes depolarization of the bipolar cell, then illumination of the surround will cause an antagonistic hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell. Likewise, if the cell is depolarized by a spot turning from light to dark in the center of its receptive field, it will be hyperpolarized by the same dark stimulus applied to the surround. Thus, these cells are said to have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields."
4893,"The antagonistic surround appears to come from a complex interaction of horizontal cells, photoreceptors, and bipolar cells at their synapses. The center-surround receptive field organization is passed on from bipolar cells to ganglion cells via synapses in the inner plexiform layer. The lateral connections of the amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer also contribute to the elaboration of ganglion cell receptive fields and the integration of rod and cone input to ganglion cells."
4894,"Numerous types of amacrine cells have been identified, and their particular contributions to ganglion cell responses are still being investigated. The sole source of output from the retina to the rest of the brain is the action potentials arising from about a million ganglion cells. The activity of these cells can be recorded electrophysiologically not only in the retina but also in the optic nerve where their axons travel."
4895,"Much of my scientific life has been spent studying the functional organization of the vertebrate retina—how the retinal cells are wired, how they respond when the retina is illuminated, and how the retina processes visual information. What led me to undertake this research? As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I worked in George Wald’s laboratory at Harvard."
4896,"Wald discovered the role of vitamin A in vision and had long been interested in photoreceptor mechanisms. With Wald, I studied the effects of vitamin A deficiency on photoreceptors, which brought me to the question of how visual sensitivity relates to visual pigment levels in photoreceptors. In other words, what mechanisms underlie the loss of visual sensitivity in vitamin A deficiency, and does this relate to the sensitivity changes that occur during light and dark adaptation?"
4897,"This early work was carried out in the rat, and I found there is a relationship between visual pigment levels and the logarithm of visual sensitivity in both vitamin A deficiency and during dark adaptation. Rat retinas, however, mainly possess rod photoreceptors, and an obvious next question was whether a similar relationship between visual pigment levels and light sensitivity holds also for cones. I decided to test this by switching to ground squirrels, whose retinas mainly possess cones."
4898,"Among other things, I was curious about how cone photoreceptors differ from rod photoreceptors, and so I examined the ground squirrel photoreceptors by electron microscopy. What caught my eye one day were the cone synaptic terminals and the realization that I could follow an occasional process from a synaptic terminal back to its cell of origin. Bipolar cell branches extended to the synaptic terminals, as expected, but I could also identify horizontal cell processes synapsing with the photoreceptors! This was new and exciting."
4899,"Horizontal cells were very much a mystery then; indeed, some investigators thought they were glial cells, but the fact that they made synapses with the photoreceptors clearly indicated they were neurons. What, then, is the neuronal circuitry of the retina, and what is the role of the retinal interneurons—the horizontal and amacrine cells? This became an area of intense interest and study."
4900,"I joined forces with Brian Boycott, and we explored the cellular and synaptic organization of the outer and inner plexiform layers of the retina. We found that the photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals make ribbon synapses onto multiple postsynaptic targets, whereas amacrine cells and at least some horizontal cell processes make conventional synapses on single postsynaptic elements. In addition to ground squirrel retinas, we examined monkey, human, cat, frog, and goldfish retinas, and they all showed basic similarities in retinal wiring."
4901,"The next step was to record from the various retinal cells, and that work was undertaken in my laboratory by Frank Werblin, a graduate student with training in electrical engineering. We chose the mudpuppy retina as our animal because of its large cells, and soon Frank had recordings from all the retinal cell types. He confirmed the identity of the recorded cells by staining them intracellularly after the recording—a routine technique today, but then very difficult and occasionally messy."
4902,"More than once, Frank emerged from the darkroom where the experiments were carried out covered with the blue dye we then used. What those experiments told us was that there are both ON-center and OFF-center bipolar cells in the retina and that bipolar cells have a center-surround receptive field organization, with the horizontal cells accounting for the antagonistic surround response. Further, many amacrine cells respond transiently to illumination, giving ON-OFF responses, and appear to be involved in detecting movement."
4903,"These recordings, along with electron microscopic observations on the mudpuppy retina, enabled us to suggest the main pathways of information flow through the retina and the roles of the various cells and synapses. Many questions remained, many of which are being explored even today. However, being able to draw a diagram of the functional organization of the retina at that time, however imperfect and incomplete, was immensely satisfying, and it has encouraged, I like to believe, numerous additional studies on retinal mechanisms in the 35 years since."
4904,"Most retinal ganglion cells have the concentric center-surround receptive field organization discussed above for bipolar cells. ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cells receive input from the corresponding type of bipolar cell. Thus, an ON-center ganglion cell will be depolarized and respond with a barrage of action potentials when a small spot of light is projected onto the middle of its receptive field."
4905,"Likewise, an OFF-center cell will respond to a small dark spot presented to the middle of its receptive field. However, in both types of cells, the response to stimulation of the center is canceled by the response to stimulation of the surround. The surprising implication is that most retinal ganglion cells are not particularly responsive to changes in illumination that include both the receptive field center and the receptive field surround."
4906,"Rather, it appears that the ganglion cells are mainly responsive to differences in illumination that occur within their receptive fields. To illustrate this point, consider the response generated by an OFF-center cell as a light-dark edge crosses its receptive field. Remember that in such a cell, dark in the center of the receptive field causes the cell to depolarize, whereas dark in the surround causes the cell to hyperpolarize."
4907,"In uniform illumination, the center and surround cancel to yield some low level of response. When the edge enters the surround region of the receptive field without encroaching on the center, the dark area has the effect of hyperpolarizing the neuron, leading to a decrease in the cell’s firing rate. As the dark area begins to include the center, however, the partial inhibition by the surround is overcome, and the cell response increases."
4908,"But when the dark area finally fills the entire surround, the center response is again canceled. Notice that the cell response in this example is only slightly different in uniform light and in uniform dark; the response is modulated mainly by the presence of the light-dark edge in its receptive field. Now let’s consider the output of all the OFF-center ganglion cells that are stimulated by a stationary light-dark edge imaged on the retina."
4909,"The responses will fall into the same four categories illustrated. Thus, the cells that will register the presence of the edge are those with receptive field centers and surrounds that are differentially affected by the light and dark areas."
4910,"The population of cells with receptive field centers “viewing” the light side of the edge will be inhibited. The population of cells with centers “viewing” the dark side of the edge will be excited. In this way, the difference in illumination at a light-dark edge is not faithfully represented by the difference in the output of ganglion cells on either side of the edge."
4911,"Instead, the center-surround organization of the receptive fields leads to a neural response that emphasizes the contrast at light-dark edges. There are many visual illusions involving the perception of light level. The organization of ganglion cell receptive fields suggests an explanation for the illusion. Even though the two central squares are the same shade of gray, the square on the left background appears darker. Consider the two ON-center receptive fields shown on the gray squares."
4912,"In both cases, the same gray light hits the receptive field center. However, the receptive field on the left has more light in its surround than the receptive field on the right. This will lead to a lower response and may be related to the darker appearance of the left gray square."
4913,"Most ganglion cells in the mammalian retina have a center-surround receptive field with either an ON or an OFF center. They can be further categorized based on their appearance, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. In the macaque monkey retina and human retina, two major types of ganglion cells are distinguished: large M-type ganglion cells and smaller P-type ganglion cells."
4914,"The relative sizes of M and P ganglion cells at the same location on the retina show that P cells constitute about 90% of the ganglion cell population, M cells constitute about 5%, and the remaining 5% is made up of a variety of non-M-non-P ganglion cell types that are less well characterized."
4915,"The visual response properties of M cells differ from those of P cells in several ways. They have larger receptive fields, they conduct action potentials more rapidly in the optic nerve, and they are more sensitive to low-contrast stimuli. In addition, M cells respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, while P cells respond with a sustained discharge as long as the stimulus is on."
4916,Different types of ganglion cells appear to play different roles in visual perception. Another important distinction between ganglion cell types is that some P cells and non-M-non-P cells are sensitive to differences in the wavelength of light.
4917,"The majority of these color-sensitive neurons are called color-opponent cells, reflecting the fact that the response to one wavelength in the receptive field center is canceled by showing another wavelength in the receptive field surround. Two types of opponency are found: red versus green and blue versus yellow. Consider, for example, a cell with a red ON center and a green OFF surround."
4918,"The center of the receptive field is fed mainly by red cones; therefore, the cell responds to red light by firing action potentials. Note that even a red light that bathes the entire receptive field is an effective stimulus. However, the response is reduced because red light has some effect on green cones that feed into the green OFF surround."
4919,"The response to red is only canceled by green light in the surround. Shorthand notation for such a cell is R↗G↘, meaning simply that it is excited by red in the receptive field center, and this response is inhibited by green in the surround. What would be the response to white light on the entire receptive field?"
4920,"Because white light contains all visible wavelengths, both center and surround would be equally activated, thereby canceling the response of the cell. Blue-yellow color opponency works the same way. Consider a cell with a blue ON center and a yellow OFF surround."
4921,"Blue light drives blue cones that feed the receptive field center, while yellow light activates both red and green cones that feed the surround. Again, diffuse blue light would be an effective stimulus for this cell, but yellow in the surround would cancel the response, as would diffuse white light. The lack of color opponency in M cells is accounted for by the fact that both the center and surround of the receptive field receive input from more than one type of cone."
4922,"Perceived color is based on the relative activity of ganglion cells whose receptive field centers receive input from red, green, and blue cones. Demonstrate this to yourself by fixating on the cross in the middle of the red box in Figure 9.29 for a minute or so."
4923,"This will have the effect of light-adapting some of your red cones. Then look at the white box. The activation of the green cones by the white light is unopposed, and you see a green square."
4924,"Similarly, if you fixate on the blue box, you will see yellow when you shift your gaze to the white box. Thus, it appears that the ganglion cells provide a stream of information to the brain that is involved in the spatial comparison of three different opposing processes: light versus dark, red versus green, and blue versus yellow. One of the important concepts that emerges from our discussion of the retina is the idea of parallel processing in the visual system."
4925,"Here’s why. First, we view the world with not one but two eyes that provide two parallel streams of information. In the central visual system, these streams are compared to give information about depth, the distance of an object from the observer."
4926,"Second, there appear to be independent streams of information about light and dark that arise from the ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cells in each retina. Third, ganglion cells of both ON and OFF varieties have different types of receptive fields and response properties. M cells can detect subtle contrasts over their large receptive fields and are likely to contribute to low-resolution vision."
4927,"P cells have small receptive fields that are well suited for the discrimination of fine detail. P cells and non-M-non-P cells are specialized for the separate processing of red-green and blue-yellow information. In this chapter, we have seen how light emitted by or reflected off objects in space can be imaged by the eye onto the retina."
4928,"Light energy is first converted into membrane potential changes in the mosaic of photoreceptors. It is interesting to note that the transduction mechanism in photoreceptors is very similar to that in olfactory receptor cells, both of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Photoreceptor membrane potential is converted into a chemical signal, which is again converted into membrane potential changes in the postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells."
4929,"This process of electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical signaling repeats again and again until the presence of light or dark or color is finally converted to a change in the action potential firing frequency of the ganglion cells. The information from the 125 million photoreceptors is funneled into 1 million ganglion cells. In the central retina, particularly the fovea, relatively few photoreceptors feed each ganglion cell, whereas in the peripheral retina, thousands of receptors do."
4930,"Thus, the mapping of visual space onto the array of optic nerve fibers is not uniform. Rather, in ""neural space,"" there is an overrepresentation of the central few degrees of visual space, and signals from individual cones are more important. This specialization ensures high acuity in central vision but also requires that the eye move to bring the images of objects of interest onto the fovea."
4931,"As we shall see in the next chapter, there is good reason to believe that the different types of information that arise from different types of ganglion cells are, at least in the early stages, processed independently. Parallel streams of information—for example, from the right and left eyes—remain segregated at the first synaptic relay in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The same can be said for the M-cell and P-cell synaptic relays in the LGN."
4932,"In the visual cortex, it appears that parallel paths may process different visual attributes. For example, the distinction in the retina between neurons that do and do not convey information about color is preserved in the visual cortex. In general, each of the more than two dozen visual cortical areas may be specialized for the analysis of different types of retinal output."
4933,"Although our visual system provides us with a unified picture of the world around us, this picture has multiple facets. Objects we see have shape and color. They have a position in space, and sometimes they move."
4934,"For us to see each of these properties, neurons somewhere in the visual system must be sensitive to them. Moreover, because we have two eyes, we actually have two visual images in our heads, and somehow they must be merged. In Chapter 9, we saw that in many ways the eye acts like a camera."
4935,"But starting with the retina, the rest of the visual system is far more elaborate, far more interesting, and capable of doing far more than any camera. For example, we saw that the retina does not simply pass along information about the patterns of light and dark that fall on it. Rather, the retina extracts information about different facets of the visual image."
4936,"There are more than 100 million photoreceptors in the retina but only 1 million axons leaving the eye carrying information to the rest of the brain. What we perceive about the world around us, therefore, depends on what information is extracted by the retina and how this information is analyzed and interpreted by the rest of the central nervous system. An example is color."
4937,"There is no such thing as color in the physical world; there is simply a spectrum of visible wavelengths of light that are reflected by objects around us. Based on the information extracted by the three types of cone photoreceptors, however, our brain somehow synthesizes a rainbow of colors and fills our world with it. In this chapter, we explore how the information extracted by the retina is analyzed by the central visual system."
4938,"The pathway serving conscious visual perception includes the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and the primary visual cortex, also called area 17, V1, or striate cortex. We will see that the information funneled through this geniculocortical pathway is processed in parallel by neurons specialized for the analysis of different stimulus attributes. The striate cortex then feeds this information to more than two dozen different extrastriate cortical areas in the temporal and parietal lobes, and many of these appear to be specialized for different types of analysis."
4939,"Much of what we know about the central visual system was first worked out in the domestic cat and then extended to the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. The macaque monkey, as it is also called, relies heavily on vision for survival in its habitat, as do we humans. In fact, tests of the performance of this primate’s visual system show that in virtually all respects, it rivals that of humans."
4940,"Thus, although most of this chapter concerns the organization of the macaque visual system, most neuroscientists agree that it approximates very closely the situation in our own brains. Although visual neuroscience cannot yet explain many aspects of visual perception, significant progress has been made in answering a more basic question: How do neurons represent the different facets of the visual world? By examining those stimuli that make different neurons in the visual cortex respond, and how these response properties arise, we begin to see how the brain portrays the visual world around us."
4941,"The neural pathway that leaves the eye, beginning with the optic nerve, is often referred to as the retinofugal projection. The suffix -fugal is from the Latin word meaning “to flee” and is commonly used in neuroanatomy to describe a pathway that is directed away from a structure. Thus, a centrifugal projection goes away from the center, a corticofugal projection goes away from the cortex, and the retinofugal projection goes away from the retina."
4942,"We begin our tour of the central visual system by looking at how the retinofugal projection courses from each eye to the brain stem on each side and how the task of analyzing the visual world is initially divided among and organized within certain structures of the brain stem. Then we focus on the major arm of the retinofugal projection that mediates conscious visual perception. The ganglion cell axons ""fleeing"" the retina pass through three structures before they form synapses in the brain stem."
4943,"The components of this retinofugal projection are, in order, the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the optic tract. The optic nerves exit the left and right eyes at the optic disks, travel through the fatty tissue behind the eyes in their bony orbits, and then pass through holes in the floor of the skull. The optic nerves from both eyes combine to form the optic chiasm, which lies at the base of the brain, just anterior to where the pituitary gland hangs down."
4944,"At the optic chiasm, the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross from one side to the other. The crossing of a fiber bundle from one side of the brain to the other is called a decussation. Because only the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross, we say that a partial decussation of the retinofugal projection occurs at the optic chiasm."
4945,"Following the partial decussation at the optic chiasm, the axons of the retinofugal projections form the optic tracts, which run just under the pia along the lateral surfaces of the diencephalon. To understand the significance of the partial decussation of the retinofugal projection at the optic chiasm, let’s review the concept of the visual field. The full visual field is the entire region of space that can be seen with both eyes looking straight ahead."
4946,"Fix your gaze on a point straight ahead. Now imagine a vertical line passing through the fixation point, dividing the visual field into left and right halves. By definition, objects appearing to the left of the midline are in the left visual hemifield, and objects appearing to the right of the midline are in the right visual hemifield."
4947,"By looking straight ahead with both eyes open and then alternately closing one eye and then the other, you will see that the central portion of both visual hemifields is viewed by both retinas. This region of space is therefore called the binocular visual field. Notice that objects in the binocular region of the left visual hemifield will be imaged on the nasal retina of the left eye and on the temporal retina of the right eye."
4948,"Because the fibers from the nasal portion of the left retina cross to the right side at the optic chiasm, all the information about the left visual hemifield is directed to the right side of the brain. Remember this rule of thumb: optic nerve fibers cross in the optic chiasm so that the left visual hemifield is ""viewed"" by the right hemisphere and the right visual hemifield is ""viewed"" by the left hemisphere. A small number of optic tract axons peel off to form synaptic connections with cells in the hypothalamus, and another 10% or so continue past the thalamus to innervate the midbrain."
4949,But most of them innervate the lateral geniculate nucleus of the dorsal thalamus. The neurons in the LGN give rise to axons that project to the primary visual cortex. This projection from the LGN to the cortex is called the optic radiation.
4950,"Lesions anywhere in the retinofugal projection from the eye to the LGN to the visual cortex cause blindness in humans. Therefore, we know that it is this pathway that mediates conscious visual perception. From our knowledge of how the visual world is represented in the retinofugal projection, we can predict the types of perceptual deficits that would result from its destruction at different levels, as might occur from a traumatic injury to the head, a tumor, or an interruption of the blood supply."
4951,"As shown in the figure, while a transection of the left optic nerve would render a person blind in the left eye only, a transection of the left optic tract would lead to blindness in the right visual field as viewed through either eye. A midline transection of the optic chiasm would affect only the fibers that cross the midline."
4952,"Because these fibers originate in the nasal portions of both retinas, blindness would result in the regions of the visual field viewed by the nasal retinas, that is, the peripheral visual fields on both sides. Unique deficits result from lesions at different sites, allowing neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists to locate sites of damage by assessing visual field deficits."
4953,"As mentioned, some retinal ganglion cells send axons to innervate structures other than the LGN. Direct projections to part of the hypothalamus play an important role in synchronizing a variety of biological rhythms, including sleep and wakefulness, with the daily dark-light cycle. Direct projections to part of the midbrain, called the pretectum, control the size of the pupil and certain types of eye movement."
4954,"About 10% of the ganglion cells in the retina project to a part of the midbrain tectum called the superior colliculus. While 10% may not seem like much of a projection, it is important to note that in primates, this is about 150,000 neurons, which is equivalent to the total number of retinal ganglion cells in a cat! In fact, the tectum of the midbrain is the major target of the retinofugal projection in all non-mammalian vertebrates. In these vertebrate groups, the superior colliculus is called the optic tectum."
4955,"This is why the projection from the retina to the superior colliculus is often called the retinotectal projection, even in mammals. In the superior colliculus, a patch of neurons activated by a point of light commands eye and head movements, via indirect connections with motor neurons in the brainstem, to bring the image of this point in space onto the fovea. This branch of the retinofugal projection is thus involved in orienting the eyes in response to new stimuli in the visual periphery."
4956,"We will return to the superior colliculus when we discuss motor systems in Chapter 14. Many of you are familiar with the famous story of David and Goliath, which appears in the Hebrew scriptures. The armies of the Philistines and the Israelites were gathered for battle when Goliath, a Philistine, came forth and challenged the Israelites to settle the dispute by sending out their best man to face him in a fight to the death."
4957,"Goliath, it seems, was a man of great proportions, measuring more than ""six cubits"" in height. Considering that a cubit is the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, about 20 inches, this means he was more than 10 feet tall! Goliath was armed to the teeth with body armor, a javelin, and a sword. To face this giant, the Israelites sent David, a young and diminutive shepherd, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones."
4958,"Here’s how the action is described: When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. He put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. Now, why, you might ask, are we giving a theology lesson in a neuroscience textbook?"
4959,"The answer is that our understanding of the visual pathway offers an explanation, in addition to divine intervention, for why Goliath was at a disadvantage in this battle. Body size is regulated by the secretion of growth hormone from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In some cases, the anterior lobe becomes hypertrophied and produces excessive amounts of the hormone, resulting in body growth to unusually large proportions."
4960,"Such individuals are called pituitary giants and can measure well over 8 feet tall. Pituitary hypertrophy also disrupts normal vision. Recall that the optic nerve fibers from the nasal retinas cross in the optic chiasm, which is adjacent to the stalk of the pituitary."
4961,"Any enlargement of the pituitary compresses these crossing fibers and results in a loss of peripheral vision called bitemporal hemianopia, or tunnel vision. We can speculate that David was able to draw close and strike Goliath because, when David raced to the battle line, the pituitary giant had completely lost sight of him. The right and left lateral geniculate nuclei, located in the dorsal thalamus, are the major targets of the two optic tracts."
4962,"Viewed in cross-section, each LGN appears to be arranged in six distinct layers of cells. By convention, the layers are numbered 1 through 6, starting with the most ventral layer, layer 1. In three dimensions, the layers of the LGN are arranged like a stack of six pancakes, one on top of the other."
4963,"The pancakes do not lie flat, however; they are bent around the optic tract like a knee joint. This shape explains the name ""geniculate,"" from the Latin ""geniculatus,"" meaning ""like a little knee."" The LGN is the gateway to the visual cortex and, therefore, to conscious visual perception."
4964,"Let’s explore the structure and function of this thalamic nucleus. LGN neurons receive synaptic input from the retinal ganglion cells, and most geniculate neurons project an axon to the primary visual cortex via the optic radiation. The segregation of LGN neurons into layers suggests that different types of retinal information are being kept separate at this synaptic relay, and indeed this is the case: Axons arising from M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells in the two retinas synapse on cells in different LGN layers."
4965,"Recall from our rule of thumb that the right LGN receives information about the left visual field. The left visual field is viewed by both the nasal left retina and the temporal right retina. At the LGN, input from the two eyes is kept separate."
4966,"In the right LGN, the right eye axons synapse on LGN cells in layers 2, 3, and 5. The left eye axons synapse on cells in layers 1, 4, and 6. A closer look at the LGN reveals that the two ventral layers, 1 and 2, contain larger neurons, and the four more dorsal layers, 3 through 6, contain smaller cells. The ventral layers are therefore called magnocellular LGN layers, and the dorsal layers are called parvocellular LGN layers. Recall that ganglion cells in the retina may also be classified into magnocellular and parvocellular groups."
4967,"As it turns out, P-type ganglion cells in the retina project exclusively to the parvocellular LGN, and M-type ganglion cells in the retina project entirely to the magnocellular LGN. In addition to the neurons in the six principal layers of the LGN, numerous tiny neurons also lie just ventral to each layer. Cells in these koniocellular layers receive input from the nonM-nonP types of retinal ganglion cells and also project to the visual cortex."
4968,"Note that the koniocellular layers are not uniquely numbered because historically, the six thick layers were numbered before cells in the koniocellular layers were discovered. In the retina, M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells respond differently to light and color. In the LGN, the different information derived from the three categories of retinal ganglion cells from the two eyes remains segregated."
4969,"The anatomical organization of the LGN supports the idea that the retina gives rise to streams of information that are processed in parallel. By inserting a microelectrode into the LGN, it is possible to study the action potential discharges of geniculate neurons in response to visual stimuli, just as was done in the retina."
4970,"The surprising conclusion of such studies is that the visual receptive fields of LGN neurons are almost identical to those of the ganglion cells that feed them. For example, magnocellular LGN neurons have relatively large center-surround receptive fields, respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, and are insensitive to differences in wavelength. All in all, they are just like M-type ganglion cells."
4971,"Likewise, parvocellular LGN cells, like P-type retinal ganglion cells, have relatively small center-surround receptive fields and respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a sustained increase in the frequency of action potentials; many of them exhibit color opponency. Receptive fields of cells in the koniocellular layers are center-surround and have either light/dark or color opponency. Within all layers of the LGN, the neurons are activated by only one eye, and ON-center and OFF-center cells are intermixed."
4972,"What makes the similarity of LGN and ganglion cell receptive fields so surprising is that the retina is not the main source of synaptic input to the LGN. The major input, constituting about 80% of the excitatory synapses, comes from the primary visual cortex. Thus, one might reasonably expect that this corticofugal feedback pathway would significantly alter the qualities of the visual responses recorded in the LGN."
4973,"So far, however, a role for this massive input has not been clearly identified. The LGN also receives synaptic inputs from neurons in the brainstem whose activity is related to alertness and attentiveness. Have you ever “seen” a flash of light when you are startled in a dark room?"
4974,"This perceived flash might be a result of the direct activation of LGN neurons by this pathway. Usually, however, this input does not directly evoke action potentials in LGN neurons, but it can powerfully modulate the magnitude of LGN responses to visual stimuli."
4975,"Thus, the LGN is more than a simple relay from the retina to the cortex; it is the first site in the ascending visual pathway where what we see is influenced by how we feel. The LGN has a single major synaptic target: the primary visual cortex. Recall that the cortex may be divided into a number of distinct areas based on their connections and cytoarchitecture."
4976,"Primary visual cortex is Brodmann’s area 17 and is located in the occipital lobe of the primate brain. Much of area 17 lies on the medial surface of the hemisphere, surrounding the calcarine fissure. Other terms used interchangeably to describe the primary visual cortex are V1 and striate cortex."
4977,"We have seen that the axons of different types of retinal ganglion cells synapse on anatomically segregated neurons in the LGN. In this section, we look at the anatomy of the striate cortex and trace the connections different LGN cells make with cortical neurons. In a later section, we explore how this information is analyzed by cortical neurons."
4978,"As we did in the LGN, in striate cortex we’ll see a close correlation between structure and function. The projection starting in the retina and extending to LGN and V1 illustrates a general organizational feature of the central visual system called retinotopy. Retinotopy is an organization whereby neighboring cells in the retina feed information to neighboring places in their target structures—in this case, the LGN and striate cortex."
4979,"In this way, the two-dimensional surface of the retina is mapped onto the two-dimensional surface of the subsequent structures. There are three important points to remember about retinotopy. First, the mapping of the visual field onto a retinotopically organized structure is often distorted, because visual space is not sampled uniformly by the cells in the retina."
4980,"Recall that there are many more ganglion cells with receptive fields in or near the fovea than in the periphery. Thus, the representation of the visual field is distorted in the striate cortex: The central few degrees of the visual field are overrepresented, or magnified, in the retinotopic map. The second point to remember is that a discrete point of light can activate many cells in the retina, and often many more cells in the target structure due to the overlap of receptive fields."
4981,"The image of a point of light on the retina actually activates a large population of cortical neurons; every neuron that contains that point in its receptive field is potentially activated. Thus, when the retina is stimulated by a point of light, the activity in the striate cortex is a broad distribution with a peak at the corresponding retinotopic location. Finally, don’t be misled by the word ""map."" There are no pictures in the primary visual cortex for a little person in our brain to look at. While it’s true that the arrangement of connections establishes a mapping between the retina and V1, perception is based on the brain’s interpretation of distributed patterns of activity, not literal snapshots of the world. The neocortex in general, and the striate cortex in particular, have neuronal cell bodies arranged into about half a dozen layers."
4982,"These layers can be seen clearly in a Nissl stain of the cortex, which leaves a deposit of dye in the soma of each neuron. Starting at the white matter, the cell layers are named by Roman numerals VI, V, IV, III, and II. Layer I, just under the pia mater, is largely devoid of neurons and consists almost entirely of axons and dendrites of cells in other layers."
4983,"The full thickness of the striate cortex from white matter to pia is about 2 mm, the height of the lowercase letter m. Describing the lamination of the striate cortex as a six-layer scheme is somewhat misleading. There are actually at least nine distinct layers of neurons. To maintain Brodmann’s convention that neocortex has six layers, however, neuroanatomists combine three sublayers into layer IV, labeled IVA, IVB, and IVC. Layer IVC is further divided into two tiers called IVC1 and IVC2."
4984,"The anatomical segregation of neurons into layers suggests that there is a division of labor in the cortex, similar to what we saw in the LGN. We can learn a lot about how the cortex handles visual information by examining the structure and connections of its different layers. The Cells of Different Layers."
4985,"Many different neuronal shapes have been identified in the striate cortex, but here we focus on two principal types, defined by the appearance of their dendritic trees. Spiny stellate cells are small neurons with spine-covered dendrites that radiate out from the cell body. They are seen primarily in the two tiers of layer IVC."
4986,Outside layer IVC are many pyramidal cells. These neurons are also covered with spines and are characterized by a single thick apical dendrite that branches as it ascends toward the pia mater and by multiple basal dendrites that extend horizontally. Notice that a pyramidal cell in one layer may have dendrites extending into other layers.
4987,"It is important to remember that only pyramidal cells send axons out of the striate cortex to form connections with other parts of the brain. The axons of stellate cells make local connections only within the cortex. In addition to the spiny neurons, inhibitory neurons, which lack spines, are sprinkled in all cortical layers as well."
4988,"These neurons form only local connections. The distinct lamination of the striate cortex is reminiscent of the layers we saw in the LGN. In the LGN, every layer receives retinal afferents and sends efferents to the visual cortex."
4989,"In the visual cortex, the situation is different; only a subset of the layers receives input from the LGN or sends output to a different cortical or subcortical area. Axons from the LGN terminate in several different cortical layers, with the largest number going to layer IVC. The output of the LGN is divided into streams of information, for example, from the magnocellular and parvocellular layers serving the right and left eyes."
4990,"These streams remain anatomically segregated in layer IVC. Magnocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC, and parvocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC. Imagine that the two tiers of layer IVC are pancakes, stacked one on top of the other."
4991,"Because the input from the LGN to the cortex is arranged topographically, we see that layer IVC contains two overlapping retinotopic maps, one from the magnocellular LGN and the other from the parvocellular LGN. Koniocellular LGN axons follow a different path, bypassing layer IV to make synapses in layers II and III. Ocular Dominance Columns."
4992,How are the left eye and right eye LGN inputs segregated when they reach layer IVC of the striate cortex? The answer was provided by a groundbreaking experiment performed in the early 1970s at Harvard Medical School by neuroscientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. They injected a radioactive amino acid into one eye of a monkey.
4993,"This amino acid was incorporated into proteins by the ganglion cells, and the proteins were transported down the ganglion cell axons into the LGN. Here, the radioactive proteins spilled out of the ganglion cell axon terminals and were taken up by nearby LGN neurons. However, not all LGN cells took up the radioactive material; only those cells that were postsynaptic to the inputs from the injected eye incorporated the labeled protein."
4994,"These cells then transported the radioactive proteins to their axon terminals in layer IVC of the striate cortex. The location of the radioactive axon terminals was visualized by first placing a film of emulsion over thin sections of striate cortex and later developing the emulsion like a photograph, a process called autoradiography. The resulting collection of silver grains on the film marked the location of the radioactive LGN inputs."
4995,"In sections cut perpendicular to the cortical surface, Hubel and Wiesel observed that the distribution of axon terminals relaying information from the injected eye was not continuous in layer IVC, but rather was split into a series of equally spaced patches, each about 0.5 mm wide. These patches were termed ocular dominance columns."
4996,"In later experiments, the cortex was sectioned tangentially, parallel to layer IV. This revealed that the left eye and right eye inputs to layer IV are laid out as a series of alternating bands, like the stripes of a zebra. Innervation of Other Cortical Layers from Layer IVC."
4997,"Most intracortical connections extend perpendicular to the cortical surface along radial lines that run across the layers, from white matter to layer I. This pattern of radial connections maintains the retinotopic organization established in layer IV. Therefore, a cell in layer VI, for example, receives information from the same part of the retina as does a cell above it in layer IV."
4998,"However, the axons of some layer III pyramidal cells extend collateral branches that make horizontal connections within layer III. Radial and horizontal connections play different roles in the analysis of the visual world, as will be seen later in the chapter. Layer IVC stellate cells project axons radially up mainly to layers IVB and III where, for the first time, information from the left eye and right eye begins to mix."
4999,"Whereas all layer IVC neurons receive only monocular input, most neurons in layers II and III receive binocular input coming from both eyes. Even so, there continues to be considerable anatomical segregation of the magnocellular and parvocellular processing streams. Layer IVC, which receives magnocellular LGN input, projects mainly to cells in layer IVB."
5000,"Layer IVC, which receives parvocellular LGN input, projects mainly to layer III. In layers III and IVB, an axon may form synapses with the dendrites of pyramidal cells of all layers. Striate Cortex Outputs."
5001,"As previously mentioned, the pyramidal cells send axons out of the striate cortex into the white matter. The pyramidal cells in different layers innervate different structures. Layer II, III, and IVB pyramidal cells send their axons to other cortical areas."
5002,Layer V pyramidal cells send axons all the way down to the superior colliculus and pons. Layer VI pyramidal cells give rise to the massive axonal projection back to the LGN. Pyramidal cell axons in all layers also branch and form local connections in the cortex.
5003,"As we have seen, layers II and III play a key role in visual processing, providing most of the information that leaves V1 for other cortical areas. Anatomical studies suggest that the V1 output comes from two distinct populations of neurons in the superficial layers. When the striate cortex is stained to reveal the presence of cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme used for cell metabolism, the stain is not uniformly distributed in layers II and III."
5004,"Rather, the cytochrome oxidase staining in cross sections of the striate cortex appears as a colonnade, a series of pillars at regular intervals, running the full thickness of layers II and III and also in layers V and VI. When the cortex is sliced tangentially through layer III, these pillars appear like the spots of a leopard. These pillars of cytochrome oxidase-rich neurons have come to be called blobs."
5005,"The blobs are in rows, each blob centered on an ocular dominance stripe in layer IV. Between the blobs are ""interblob"" regions. The blobs receive direct LGN input from the koniocellular layers, as well as parvocellular and magnocellular input from layer IVC of the striate cortex."
5006,"Beginning in the early 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel were the first to systematically explore the physiology of the striate cortex with microelectrodes. They were students of Stephen Kuffler, who was then at Johns Hopkins University and later moved with them to Harvard. They extended Kuffler’s innovative methods of receptive field mapping to the central visual pathways."
5007,"After showing that LGN neurons behave much like retinal ganglion cells, they turned their attention to the striate cortex, initially in cats and later in monkeys. The work that continues today on the physiology of the striate cortex is built on the solid foundation provided by Hubel and Wiesel’s pioneering studies. Their contributions to our understanding of the cerebral cortex were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 1981."
5008,"By and large, the receptive fields of neurons in layer IVC are similar to the magnocellular and parvocellular LGN neurons providing their input. This means they are generally small monocular center-surround receptive fields. In layer IVC, the neurons are insensitive to the wavelength of light, whereas in layer IVC, the neurons exhibit center-surround color opponency."
5009,"In the outer layer IVC, new receptive field characteristics, not observed in the retina or LGN, are found. We will explore these in some depth because they provide clues about the role V1 plays in visual processing and perception. Binocularity."
5010,Each neuron in layers IVC and IVC 3 receives afferents from a layer of the LGN representing either eye. Monocular neurons from either eye are also clumped together in V1 rather than randomly intermixed. This accounts for ocular dominance columns that can be visualized in layer IVC with autoradiography.
5011,"As we have already seen, the axons leaving layer IVC diverge and innervate more superficial cortical layers. As a consequence of the divergence, there is a mixing of inputs from the two eyes. Microelectrode recordings confirm this anatomical fact; most neurons in layers superficial to IVC are binocular, responding to light in either eye."
5012,"We say that the neurons have binocular receptive fields, meaning that they actually have two receptive fields, one in the ipsilateral and one in the contralateral eye. The construction of binocular receptive fields is essential in binocular animals, such as humans. Without binocular neurons, we would probably be unable to use the inputs from both eyes to form a single image of the world around us."
5013,"Retinotopy is preserved because the two receptive fields of a binocular neuron are precisely placed on the retinas such that they are “looking” at the same point in space. We still refer to ocular dominance columns in superficial cortical layers. However, now instead of the sharp monocular columns of layer IVC, there are patches of neurons that are more strongly driven by one eye than the other, even though they are binocular."
5014,"Orientation Selectivity. Most of the receptive fields in the retina, LGN, and layer IVC are circular and give their greatest response to a spot of light matched in size to the receptive field center. Outside layer IVC, we encounter cells that no longer follow this pattern."
5015,"While small spots can elicit a response from many cortical neurons, it is usually possible to produce a much greater response with other stimuli. By accident, it was found that many neurons in V1 respond best to an elongated bar of light moving across their receptive fields. However, the orientation of the bar is critical."
5016,The greatest response is given to a bar with a particular orientation; perpendicular bars generally elicit much weaker responses. Neurons having this type of response are said to exhibit orientation selectivity. Most of the V1 neurons outside layer IVC are orientation selective.
5017,"The optimal orientation for a neuron can be any angle around the clock. If V1 neurons can have any optimal orientation, you might wonder whether the orientation selectivity of nearby neurons is related. From early work, the answer to this question was an emphatic yes."
5018,"As a microelectrode is advanced radially from one layer to the next, the preferred orientation remains the same for all the selective neurons encountered from layer II down through layer VI. Such a radial column of cells is called an orientation column. As an electrode passes tangentially through the cortex in a single layer, the preferred orientation progressively shifts."
5019,"We now know from the use of a technique called optical imaging that there is a mosaic-like pattern of optimal orientations in the striate cortex. If an electrode is passed at certain angles through this mosaic, the preferred orientation rotates like the sweep of the minute hand of a clock, from the top of the hour to ten past to twenty past, and so on. If the electrode is moved at other angles, more sudden shifts in preferred orientation occur."
5020,"Hubel and Wiesel found that a complete 180° shift in preferred orientation required a traverse of about 1 mm, on average, within layer III. The analysis of stimulus orientation appears to be one of the most important functions of the striate cortex. Orientation-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object shape."
5021,Direction Selectivity. Many V1 receptive fields exhibit direction selectivity; they respond when a bar of light at the optimal orientation moves perpendicular to the orientation in one direction but not in the opposite direction. Direction-selective cells in V1 are a subset of the cells that are orientation selective.
5022,"Figure 10.22 shows how a direction-selective cell responds to a moving stimulus. Notice that the cell responds to an elongated stimulus swept across the receptive field, but only in a particular direction of movement."
5023,Sensitivity to the direction of stimulus motion is a hallmark of neurons receiving input from the magnocellular layers of the LGN. Direction-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object motion. Simple and Complex Receptive Fields.
5024,"Neurons in the LGN have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields, and this organization accounts for the responses of neurons to visual stimuli. For example, a small spot in the center of the receptive field may yield a much stronger response than a larger spot also covering the antagonistic surround. What do we know about the inputs to V1 neurons that might account for binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity in their receptive fields?"
5025,"Binocularity is easy; we have seen that binocular neurons receive afferents from both eyes. The mechanisms underlying orientation and direction selectivity have proven more difficult to elucidate. Many orientation-selective neurons have a receptive field elongated along a particular axis, with an ON-center or OFF-center region flanked on one or both sides by an antagonistic surround."
5026,This linear arrangement of ON and OFF areas is analogous to the concentric antagonistic areas seen in retinal and LGN receptive fields. One gets the impression that the cortical neurons receive a converging input from three or more LGN cells with receptive fields that are aligned along one axis. Hubel and Wiesel called neurons of this type simple cells.
5027,"The segregation of ON and OFF regions is a defining property of simple cells, and it is because of this receptive field structure that they are orientation selective. Other orientation-selective neurons in V1 do not have distinct ON and OFF regions and are therefore not considered simple cells. Hubel and Wiesel called most of these complex cells because their receptive fields appeared to be more complex than those of simple cells."
5028,"Complex cells give ON and OFF responses to stimuli throughout the receptive field. Hubel and Wiesel proposed that complex cells are constructed from the input of several like-oriented simple cells. However, this remains a matter of debate."
5029,"Simple and complex cells are typically binocular and sensitive to stimulus orientation. While less is known about the mechanism, many are also direction selective. In general, they are relatively insensitive to the wavelength of light, although color sensitivity is sometimes observed."
5030,"Blob Receptive Fields. The old adage says, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This idea appropriately describes the connection between structure and function in the brain."
5031,"We have seen repeatedly in the visual system that when two nearby structures are labeled differently with some anatomical technique, there is good reason to suspect the neurons in the structures are functionally different. For example, we have seen how the distinctive layers of the LGN segregate different types of input. Similarly, the lamination of the striate cortex correlates with differences in the receptive fields of the neurons."
5032,"The presence of the distinct cytochrome oxidase blobs outside layer IV of the striate cortex immediately raises the question of whether the neurons in the blobs respond differently from interblob neurons. The answer is clearly yes. The neurons in the interblob areas have some or all of the properties we discussed above: binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity."
5033,"They are both simple cells and complex cells and generally are not wavelength sensitive. Most blob cells, on the other hand, are wavelength sensitive and monocular, and they lack orientation and direction selectivity. The blobs receive input directly from the koniocellular layers of the LGN and magnocellular and parvocellular input via layer IVC."
5034,The visual responses of blob cells most resemble those of the koniocellular and parvocellular input. The receptive fields of most blob neurons are circular. Some have the color-opponent center-surround organization observed in the parvocellular and koniocellular layers of the LGN.
5035,"Other blob cell receptive fields have red-green or blue-yellow color opponency in the center of their receptive fields, with no surround regions at all. Still, other cells have both a color-opponent center and a color-opponent surround; they are called double-opponent cells. For present purposes, the most important thing to remember about blobs is that they contain the great majority of color-sensitive neurons outside layer IVC."
5036,"Thus, the blob channels appear to be specialized for the analysis of object color. Without them, we might be color-blind. Most of what we know about the response properties of neurons in the visual system, and every other system in the brain, has been learned from intracellular and extracellular recordings with microelectrodes."
5037,"These recordings give precise information about the activity of one or a few cells. However, unless one inserts thousands of electrodes, it is not possible to observe patterns of activity across large populations of neurons. What if we could simultaneously record signals from thousands of neurons simply by aiming a camera at the brain’s surface?"
5038,"Incredibly, one can observe brain activity with this optical recording approach, and the resulting images have yielded new insights about the organization of the cerebral cortex. In one version of optical recording, a voltage-sensitive dye is applied to the surface of the brain. The molecules in the dye bind to cell membranes, and they change their optical properties in proportion to variations in membrane potential."
5039,"The change is detected with either an array of photodetectors or a video camera. If this technique is used to record from a single neuron, the output of the optical detector is similar to an intracellular recording. In recordings from the cerebral cortex, the activity of individual neurons cannot be resolved, and the optical signal represents a summation of the changes in membrane potential of the neurons and glial cells in an area about 100 μm across."
5040,"A second way to optically study cortical activity is to image intrinsic signals. When neurons are active, numerous changes occur in the neurons themselves and in the surrounding tissue. Examples of such changes are ion movement, neurotransmitter release, and alterations in blood volume and oxygenation."
5041,"Because these factors are correlated with the level of neural activity and they affect the reflection of light from the brain, they are called intrinsic signals for optical recording. Thus, when intrinsic signals are used to study brain activity, membrane potentials or action potentials are not directly measured. To record intrinsic signals, light is projected onto the brain, and a video camera records the reflected light."
5042,"With the wavelengths of light usually used for illumination, the intrinsic signal is dominated by changes associated with activity-dependent increases in blood volume or blood oxygen saturation. One disadvantage of this technique is that its reliance on slow vascular changes makes it incapable of the millisecond temporal resolution possible with voltage-sensitive dyes. Figure A shows the vasculature in a portion of primary visual cortex."
5043,"Figure B shows ocular dominance columns in the same patch of striate cortex obtained by imaging areas in which blood flow changes occurred during visual stimulation. This figure is actually a subtraction of two images—one made when only the right eye was visually stimulated, minus another when only the left eye was stimulated. Consequently, the dark bands represent cells dominated by the left eye, and the light bands represent cells dominated by the right eye."
5044,Figure C is a color-coded representation of preferred orientation in the same patch of striate cortex. Four different optical images were recorded while bars of light at four different orientations were swept across the visual field. Each location in the figure is colored according to the orientation that produced the greatest response at each location on the brain.
5045,"Consistent with earlier results obtained with electrodes, in some regions, the orientation changes progressively along a straight line. However, the optical recording technique reveals that cortical organization based on orientation is much more complex than an idealized pattern of parallel ""columns."" The anatomy and physiology of the central visual pathways, from retina to striate cortex, are consistent with the idea that there are several channels that process visual input in parallel."
5046,Each one appears to be specialized for the analysis of different facets of the visual scene. Dr. Margaret Livingstone and her colleagues at Harvard University have explored the fascinating correspondence between the organization of visual pathways and the receptive field properties of neurons.
5047,"On the basis of anatomy and physiology, we can distinguish a magnocellular pathway, a parvo-interblob pathway, and a blob pathway. These pathways are summarized in Figure 10.25."
5048,"In addition to this segregation into parallel pathways, there appears to be modular processing in V1 based on retinotopy and the organization into ocular dominance columns, orientation columns, and blobs. The magnocellular pathway begins with M-type ganglion cells of the retina."
5049,"These cells project axons to the magnocellular layers of the LGN. These layers project to layer IVC of the striate cortex, which in turn projects to layer IVB. The pyramidal cells in layer IVB have binocular receptive fields of the simple and complex types."
5050,"They are orientation selective, and many are direction selective. They are generally not wavelength sensitive. Because this pathway contains neurons with transient responses, relatively large receptive fields, and the highest percentage of direction-selective neurons, it is thought to be involved in the analysis of object motion and the guidance of motor actions."
5051,"The parvo-interblob pathway originates with P-type ganglion cells of the retina, which project to the parvocellular layers of the LGN. The parvocellular LGN sends axons to layer IVC of the striate cortex, which projects to layer II and III interblob regions. These neurons are not generally direction selective or wavelength sensitive."
5052,"The binocular receptive fields are orientation selective and simple or complex. Neurons in this pathway have the smallest orientation-selective receptive fields, suggesting that they are involved in the analysis of fine object shape. The origin of the blob pathway is more mixed than that of the magnocellular and parvo-interblob pathways."
5053,Unique input to the blob pathway arises from the subset of ganglion cells that are neither M-type cells nor P-type cells. These nonM-nonP cells project to the koniocellular layers of the LGN. The koniocellular LGN projects directly to the cytochrome oxidase blobs in layers II and III.
5054,"The blobs are a site of convergence of parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular inputs. Typical receptive fields in the blobs are center-surround and color-opponent. They are often monocular and lack orientation selectivity."
5055,"The uniquely high incidence of wavelength sensitivity in the blobs suggests that the neurons are involved in the analysis of object color. While parallel pathways are a compelling feature of the visual system, it is important to note that they are not “pure.” There is some mixing both within V1 and beyond, resulting in the interaction of signals from the magnocellular, parvo-interblob, and blob pathways."
5056,"At present, we do not know whether this mixing is useless “contamination” that degrades information transmission within pathways or the source of valuable integration of different visual attributes. Cortical modules. Each point in the visual world is analyzed by thousands of cortical neurons."
5057,"The retinotopic organization of the projections from the retina to the LGN to the primary visual cortex ensures that all the neurons analyzing a point in visual space are within a circumscribed patch of the cortex. Hubel and Wiesel showed that the image of a point in space falls within the receptive fields of neurons within a 2 × 2 mm region of layer III. For a complete analysis, this 2 × 2 mm patch of active neurons must include representatives from each of the processing channels from the right and left eyes."
5058,"Fortunately, a 2 × 2 mm chunk of cortex would contain two complete sets of ocular dominance columns, 16 blobs, and, in the cells between blobs, a complete sampling of all 180° of possible orientations. Thus, Hubel and Wiesel argued that a 2 × 2 mm chunk of striate cortex is both necessary and sufficient to analyze the image of a point in space, necessary because its removal would leave a blind spot for this point in the visual field and sufficient because it contains all the neural machinery required to analyze the participation of this point in oriented and/or colored contours viewed through either eye. Such a unit of brain tissue has come to be called a cortical module."
5059,"The striate cortex is constructed from perhaps a thousand cortical modules, and one is shown in Figure 10.26. We can think of a visual scene being simultaneously processed by these modules, each “looking” at a portion of the scene."
5060,"Just remember that the modules are an idealization. Optical images of V1 activity reveal that the regions of the striate cortex responding to different eyes and orientations are not nearly as regular as the “ice cube model” in Figure 10 suggests. In thinking about what factors led to my favorite discoveries, I recall that there always seemed to be a combination of luck and having the right question percolating around in my mind."
5061,"David Hubel and I worked out the interlacing connectivity between the different subdivisions of V1 and V2 because we had been recording from the V1 blobs and were very curious about their connectivity. The lucky part was that a colleague gave us a very large number of squirrel monkeys—otherwise, we would not have had enough money to do the study. We started looking at the roles of the magno and parvo systems in perception after seeing Patrick Cavanagh’s astonishing demonstration of the slowing down of motion perception at equiluminance."
5062,"On seeing the demonstration, I immediately said, “That’s because the magno system is color-blind.” David Hubel replied, “That’s ridiculous; if that were the case, then stereopsis should be color-blind.” So we looked at some stereograms at equiluminance, and sure enough, we couldn’t see stereopsis at equiluminance."
5063,"Each time I thought we had settled the hypothesis that magno functions should be diminished at equiluminance, David would object, saying that some other visual task should be similarly affected. After 2 years of arguing and doing every experiment he could think of, we finally convinced ourselves that it was the case and published a very long paper on the parallel processing of form, color, motion, and depth. We looked at all kinds of visual functions to see which ones were diminished at equiluminance to determine whether they might be carried selectively by the magno system, and one of the things we found that was adversely affected at equiluminance was reading."
5064,"This got me interested in looking at dyslexia. People with dyslexia often complain that ordinary text seems jittery, just like what non-dyslexics experience when reading equiluminant text. I got lucky in sharing this idea with Al Galaburda because he turned out to have an entire collection of dyslexic and control brains, and this collaboration led to our developing a theory about the etiology of dyslexia."
5065,"Whenever I would give scientific talks about the parallel processing of form, color, motion, and depth, I would use works of art to illustrate the points about how various visual functions would disappear at equiluminance, because a lot of op art uses just this principle. I found that people in the audience were often more interested in the art than the science, so I started including more art and less science in my lectures. I also started collecting the best examples I could find of works of art that illustrated various points in my lectures."
5066,"After a while, I had so many of them that I started writing an article, thinking I would publish it in Scientific American, but I had collected so many examples that it turned into a book. An editor I was working with on the book told me that although it was obvious I knew a lot about art, it was equally obvious that I knew nothing about art history, and he recommended I read an art history book. So I did, and when I got to the Renaissance, the author urged the reader to look carefully at the Mona Lisa and observe how lifelike she seemed, and how her expression seemed to change."
5067,"I noticed that her expression did change, but it changed systematically with my gaze direction. I realized this was because her smile was blurry and therefore more visible to my low-resolution peripheral vision than to my high-acuity central vision. From my work on dyslexics, I became interested in the possibility that artistic talent might have some biological basis."
5068,"An astonishing number of talented artists, musicians, actors, and computer programmers contacted me and told me that they were dyslexic. It became clear that some of them were so talented that their success couldn’t be simply compensation for being bad at reading, and the idea that something that might be a disability in one realm of life might be an asset in another was forced upon me. I began thinking that one small component of artistic talent in dyslexics might be poor depth perception because a painter’s job is to flatten the 3-D world onto a flat canvas, and I started looking for evidence of poor depth perception in artists."
5069,"Mostly, I looked at photographs of famous artists because you can legitimately diagnose strabismus, which would result in stereoblindness, from photographs. During vacation, I noticed that all four of the Rembrandt self-portraits in the Louvre look walleyed. I looked at a very large number of Rembrandt self-portraits, but I couldn’t see any pattern as to which eye deviated outward, which you would expect if Rembrandt had had one bad eye."
5070,"One of my students, Bevil Conway, is himself a stereoblind artist, and he pointed out that we should look at etchings and paintings separately, because etchings are mirror image reversed from the plate. Then we saw the pattern! So for me, Pasteur’s maxim that luck favors the prepared mind has repeatedly been true. The striate cortex is called V1, for “visual area one,” because it is the first cortical area to receive information from the LGN."
5071,"Beyond V1 lie another two dozen distinct areas of cortex, each of which contains a representation of the visual world. The contributions to vision of these extrastriate areas are still being vigorously debated. However, the emerging picture is that there are two large-scale cortical streams of visual processing: one stretching dorsally from the striate cortex toward the parietal lobe and the other projecting ventrally toward the temporal lobe."
5072,"The dorsal stream appears to serve the analysis of visual motion and the visual control of action. The ventral stream is thought to be involved in the perception of the visual world and the recognition of objects. These processing streams have primarily been studied in the macaque monkey brain, where recordings from single neurons can be made."
5073,"However, functional magnetic resonance imaging research has begun to identify areas in the human brain that have properties analogous to brain areas in the macaque. The dorsal and ventral streams in the extrastriate cortex are related to the magnocellular, parvo-interblob, and blob pathways in V1. As we will see below, the properties of dorsal stream neurons are most similar to magnocellular neurons in V1, and ventral stream neurons have properties combining features of parvo-interblob and blob cells in V1."
5074,"It appears to be a reasonable approximation to view the dorsal stream as an extension of the V1 magnocellular pathway and the ventral stream as an extension of V1 parvo-interblob and blob pathways. However, each extrastriate stream receives some amount of input from all the pathways that are segregated in the primary visual cortex. Thus, the extrastriate streams appear to be dominated by input from particular V1 pathways rather than exclusive extensions of them."
5075,"The cortical areas composing the dorsal stream are not arranged in a strict serial hierarchy, but there does appear to be a progression of areas in which more complex or specialized visual representations develop. Projections from V1 extend to areas designated V2 and V3, but we will skip farther ahead in the dorsal stream to Area MT."
5076,"In an area known as V5 or MT, strong evidence indicates that specialized processing of object motion takes place. Area MT receives retinotopically organized input from a number of other cortical areas, such as V2 and V3, and it is also directly innervated by cells in layer IVB of the striate cortex. Recall that in layer IVB, the cells have relatively large receptive fields, transient responses to light, and direction selectivity."
5077,"Neurons in area MT have large receptive fields that respond to stimulus movement in a narrow range of directions. Area MT is most notable for the fact that almost all the cells are direction-selective, unlike areas earlier in the dorsal stream or anywhere in the ventral stream. The neurons in MT also respond to types of motion, such as drifting spots of light, that are not good stimuli for cells in other areas—it appears that the motion of the objects is more important than their structure."
