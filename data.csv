"Almost all living organisms from humans to bacteria possess a circadian clock . This internal timekeeping system enables organisms to anticipate and adapt to the rhythmic environmental changes that occur over a 24-hour cycle. At their molecular core, these clocks are comprised of cell-autonomous transcription-translation negative feedback loops ."
"In most animals, the master circadian clock in the brain receives light cues via the eyes which enable synchronization  with the external 24-hour light-dark cycles. The master clock sits at the top of the hierarchy and in turn modulates the activity of downstream neurons, as well as the peripheral clocks located in tissues throughout the body via endocrine and systemic signaling. In vertebrates, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  of the hypothalamus and is comprised of approximately 20,000 neurons ."
"Extensive intercellular coupling between these neurons likely via neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gap junctions forms a neuronal network that is resilient to internal and environmental perturbations . Systematic characterization of these diverse coupling mechanisms between clock neurons is thus crucial to understanding circadian clock entrainment and the mutual coupling of the clock neurons. In addition, unraveling the clock output pathways which generate rhythmic behaviors and hormonal signaling can provide mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of organismal physiology and homeostasis."
"These aims are particularly challenging to accomplish in vertebrates due to the large neuronal network size and resultant increase in complexity. However, the molecular clock architecture as well as the neuronal network motifs are highly conserved from humans to insects . Hence, Drosophila melanogaster with its powerful genetic toolkit and a complete brain connectome represents an ideal system for deciphering the clock network and its input and output pathways ."
"Not surprisingly, the fly circadian clock, generally regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons, is extremely well characterized . These neurons have historically been classified into different groups of Lateral and Dorsal Neurons  based on their size, anatomy, location in the brain, and differences in gene expression . Further, these neuronal subgroups are active at different times during the day and are consequently distinct functionally ."
"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing analyses of clock neurons recently revealed additional heterogeneity within some of these clusters, which can largely be explained by neuronal signaling molecules that they express . Comprehensive mapping of the synaptic partners of clock neurons and comparing this connectivity can determine if the molecular heterogeneity based on gene expression also translates into heterogenous synaptic connectivity. Nonetheless, given the rich array of neuropeptides expressed in clock neurons, both synaptic and paracrine signaling appear crucial in mediating the connectivity between clock neurons as well as their output pathways."
"Here, we harnessed the power of connectomics to generate the first comprehensive connectivity map of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, we identified additional DN in the network, thus showing that the Drosophila circadian clock is in fact comprised of at least 240 neurons instead of 150 neurons. In addition, our analyses revealed that light input from extrinsic photoreceptors to the clock neurons is largely indirect."
"Furthermore, we discovered extensive ipsilateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons and identified a subset of DN as an important hub that link the clock network across the two brain hemispheres via contralateral projections. We also elucidated the output pathways from the clock network that could affect general behavioral activity levels and organismal physiology. In particular, we characterized clock inputs to subsets of neurosecretory cells  in the brain which collectively represent a major neuroendocrine center ."
"We observed sparse monosynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC, suggesting that multi-synaptic connections and peptidergic signaling account for most of the connectivity, as is characteristic of the vertebrate clock output pathways . Hence, as a complementary approach, we also deciphered putative paracrine signaling pathways within the clock network by extensively mapping the expression of clock neuropeptides and their receptors, and filtering them based on the topographical constraints determined by the connectome. This peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity within the clock network and is the major output pathway to the neuroendocrine center which regulates systemic physiology."
"The master clock in the Drosophila brain is widely regarded to be comprised of approximately 150 neurons. This number is derived from neuronal expression of different clock genes . Clk856-Gal4, based on the Clk promoter, faithfully recapitulates expression in most of these clock neurons ."
"These neurons can be broadly classified into four classes each of LN and DN . The LN comprise Lateral Posterior Neurons , dorsoLateral Neurons , Ion Transport Peptide -expressing LN , and Pigment-Dispersing Factor - expressing ventroLateral Neurons . Conversely, the DN include anterior Dorsal Neurons 1 , posterior DN1 , DN2 and DN3."
"These clock neuron classes can be further subdivided into different cell types . Morphological characterization of some DN1p and DN3 subtypes is currently lacking . Moreover, the estimated number of clock neurons in Drosophila is likely an underestimation as the precise number of DN3 has not been determined thus far ."
"This is partly because drivers like Clk856-Gal4 only include a small proportion of DN3 . In addition, most DN3 have small somata that are densely packed together, making it difficult to count. Majority of these small DN3 project to the central brain, and hence they are aptly called small Central Projecting DN3   ."
"Similarly, a pair of DN3 with large somata project to the central brain , whereas about 6 neurons per brain hemisphere project to the anterior brain  . These latter cells also have larger somata than the s-CPDN3 . Despite the large number of DN3, previous studies suggest that they are less important for behavioral rhythmicity compared to some of the LN, which are regarded as the master pacemaker neurons ."
"As a first step in determining the synaptic connectivity within the clock network, we used a systematic approach  to identify most, if not all, of the clock neurons in the FlyWire connectome generated in our companion papers . In total, we successfully identified 242 clock neurons based on a combination of morphology, previously determined connectivity, and location of their cell soma  . The number of clock neurons that we identified in the connectome was considerably higher than the expected number of clock neurons  in the adult brain ."
"This was mainly due to the presence of more s-CPDN3 in the connectome than estimated, which prompted us to accurately quantify the total number of DN3 in adult brains. To comprehensively quantify DN3, we used antibodies against clock proteins Period  and Vrille  in tim-Gal4 > GFP expressing flies. Since PER and VRI exhibit peak expression at different Zeitgeber times , the inclusion of three clock markers  can provide a reliable estimate of the total number of DN3 ."
"Indeed, our analyses revealed that there are more than 70 DN3 per hemisphere in both males and females . Thus, the number of DN3 identified in the connectome  is in line with our DN3 estimate  based on anatomical analysis. The majority of these are s-CPDN3  which we now classified into five subtypes  based on morphological similarity ."
"These five DN3 subtypes are comprised of 26 distinct cell types  and could thus be subdivided further in the future. Additionally, we also identified several candidate DN1p which could not be classified into previously characterized DN1p cell types . To verify if these neurons identified in the connectome are indeed DN1p, we characterized them anatomically."
"Specifically, we performed multi-color flip out  analysis of DN1p using Clk4. 1M-Gal4 to elucidate the morphology of this densely packed neuronal cluster. In total, about 14 DN1p per hemisphere are labeled with the Clk4."
1M-Gal4 . MCFO analysis revealed DN1pA  and DN1pB  subtypes characterized previously . Our analysis additionally revealed the morphology of previously uncharacterized DN1p subtypes .
"DN1pC and DN1pE are each comprised of two neurons per hemisphere . DN1pD is comprised of four neurons per hemisphere . Two of these project over the midline while the other two remain ipsilateral, suggesting that the DN1pD is comprised of two morphologically distinct subtypes."
"Notably, our analysis confirmed that the candidate DN1p identified from the connectome are in fact morphologically similar to DN1pC-E subtypes labeled by Clk4. 1M-Gal4. Taken together, our identification and morphological characterization of novel DN3 and DN1p subtypes provide a solid framework to comprehensively examine the connectivity of clock neurons."
"The FlyWire connectome combines automatically detected chemical synapses with proofread neurons. These synapses represent an additional anatomical feature that could potentially distinguish neuronal groups. Consequently, we asked whether the classification of clock neurons based on differences in their synaptic connectivity aligns with the traditional anatomical and recent gene expression-based classification."
"To address this, we clustered clock neurons based on cosine similarity between their total synaptic inputs and outputs. Our clustering analysis shows that neurons of a given clock cell type  usually cluster together, suggesting that neurons from the same group are more similar  to each other than to other clock neurons . For example, all three LNd CRY- from one hemisphere are part of the same clade."
"Similarly, the two DN2 are part of a clade. Exceptions to this are the clades containing DN1p and DN3. For DN1p, this can be explained by our findings which show that this group comprises five morphologically distinct subtypes."
"In the case of DN3, while some of them form their own cluster, other DN3 cluster together with different clock neuron subtypes. On one hand, this is not unexpected since it is unlikely for such a large group of neurons to have similar connectivity patterns. On the other hand, this is quite interesting since it provides insights into their possible function."
"For instance, heterogenous clusters comprising clock neurons of different classes have similar synaptic inputs and outputs, and may thus play similar roles in the clock network and beyond. Moreover, the connectivitybased clustering does not resolve the five subtypes of the s- CPDN3. This suggests that these five s-CPDN3 subtypes comprise synaptically heterogeneous cell populations."
"Nonetheless, synaptic connectivity-based classification of clock neurons largely aligns with the ones determined based on anatomical and gene expression differences. Having identified all the clock neurons, we next sought to determine their synaptic interconnectivity which could facilitate intercellular coupling within the network. Generally, we regarded >4 common synapses per neuron as significant connections and >9 synapses as strong connections."
"We first wanted to validate our analysis by comparing it with previously reported connections. In agreement with previous reports , we observed strong synaptic connectivity from DN1a to LNITP, from DN1pA to LNITP and LNd, and from DN1pB to DN2 clusters , highlighting the robustness of our approach. Importantly, our analysis also uncovered novel connections between the different subgroups."
"Specifically, we observed strong contralateral and ipsilateral connectivity from DN1pA to LNITP, as well as additional significant connections with s- CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, and LNd CRY+ across both hemispheres. Similarly, LNITP also provide synaptic inputs to s-CPDN3 clusters in both hemispheres . This raised the question of whether DN1pA represents a heterogeneous population where one subgroup forms ipsilateral connections and the other contralateral."
"To address this, we examined the connectivity at cellular resolution  which revealed that individual DN1pA indeed form both ipsilateral and contralateral connections . Our analysis thus identified DN1pA as an important center which links the clock network across the two brain hemispheres. These results are in line with previous reports of contralateral projections of DN1p ."
"In contrast, there are virtually no synaptic connections between the s- LNv and the LNd neurons , which control morning and evening activities, respectively. This is consistent with previous analyses using the hemibrain connectome . Interestingly, the connectivity of clock neurons across both hemispheres is not symmetrical, owing to the differences in the number of synapses ."
"To assess the extent of inter-individual differences in the numbers, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity of clock neurons, we next performed comparisons with the partial hemibrain connectome . Several groups of clock neurons were previously identified in the hemibrain connectome including all s-LNv, l-LNv, LNd, LNITP, LPN, DN1a, and some DN2, DN1p, and DN3 . Here, we identified additional DN1p and DN3 ."
"In total, 64 clock neurons can be identified in the hemibrain connectome, with the majority of missing neurons belonging to the DN3 subgroups . Comparison of different subgroups revealed stable neuronal numbers across the two connectomes . Similarly, there is a high degree of stereotypy in the connectivity between the clock clusters ."
"For instance, l-LNv and DN2 form the least synaptic contacts with other clock clusters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, s-CPDN3A are connected to all the clock clusters except for s-LNv, l-LNv, DN1a, and DN1pE. Given its partial nature, the hemibrain connectome lacks information about all contralateral connections, reiterating the significance of characterizing information flow across entire networks."
"Taken together, our analyses revealed hitherto unknown connectivity between the clock neurons which could contribute to the robustness of the master clock. Moreover, the identification of the complete circadian neuronal network in the FlyWire connectome underscores the power of the fruit fly in pushing forward the frontier of our understanding of chronobiology. Validating clock neuron connectivity using trans-synaptic tracing While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, we further used an independent approach to validate our connectivity analyses."
"We performed light microscopy-based trans-synaptic circuit tracing by expressing trans-Tango  using specific driver lines for different populations of clock neurons . Upon driving trans-Tango with Clk4. 1M-Gal4 which labels most DN1p , we observed post-synaptic signals in DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, 5th-LNv, and s-LNv ."
"However, l-LNv and DN1a were not post-synaptic to DN1p. Thus, our trans-Tango analysis of DN1p agrees with the connectivity of DN1p based on the connectomes . Similarly, a split- Gal4 line targeting DN3 drives post-synaptic signals in DN1a, DN1p, DN2, DN3, LPN, LNd, and l-LNv , which mirrors the connectivity seen in the connectomes."
"While post-synaptic signal was not detected in most clock neurons of control flies, occasionally, a false post-synaptic signal was detected in two clock neurons  from the entire network . Hence, any potential synaptic output to LNd should be treated with caution. Overall, we observed similar congruency between the two approaches with other Gal4- lines including those targeting DN2 , LPN , and LNITP ."
"Differences compared to the connectomes were observed when driving trans-Tango with Pdf-Gal4   and with the DN1a-specific split-Gal4 line . In both cases, trans-Tango generated postsynaptic signals in more clock neurons than anticipated based on the connectomes. This discrepancy could be explained by: 1) the presence of additional neurons in the Gal4 ) and/or 2) daily remodeling of neural circuits, as shown previously for s-LNv and DN1a ."
"In summary, our trans-Tango analysis is largely in agreement with the clock network generated using the connectomes. Deciphering light input pathways via in-silico retrograde tracing of clock neurons Following the successful validation of our connectivity data, we next identified all the major classes of neurons providing inputs to the clock network. To this end, we utilized the annotation scheme of our companion paper , which provides a hierarchical classification of all neurons in the connectome ."
"We found that neurons intrinsic to the brain provide the majority of the inputs to the clock network . This includes visual centrifugal neurons projecting from the central brain to the optic lobes, visual projection neurons projecting from the optic lobes to the central brain, as well neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes and central brain . Examining inputs to specific clock clusters, we observed differential inputs across all the subgroups ."
"As expected, s- LNv and l-LNv receive most of their input from optic lobe and visual centrifugal neurons as they have a large number of input sites in the optic lobes and the accessory medulla  . In contrast, APDN3, l-CPDN3, and LNITP populations receive major inputs from visual projection neurons. The remaining clock clusters receive most of their inputs from central brain neurons ."
"In some cases, such as DN1pC-E, DN2, and s-CPDN3A-E, a significant portion of these central neurons are clock neurons themselves, confirming prominent intercellular synaptic connectivity between some clock clusters. Interestingly, only 4 sensory neurons provide direct inputs to the clock network. These are anterior cells    which provide temperature inputs to LPN, DN1pC, and DN1pE ."
"Having broadly classified the inputs from different neuronal super classes to the clock network, we probed further and identified individual cells providing the strongest synaptic inputs to clock neurons. For this purpose, we used a stringent threshold of 80 synapses to obtain a narrow list of candidate inputs. Our analysis discovered 13 neurons, including 7 aMe neurons  that are strongly connected to specific downstream clock neurons ."
"For example, individual aMe3 and aMe6a neurons can form more than 79 synapses with APDN3, while aMe8 are similarly connected to LNd CRY+ & ITP clock neurons . The unifying feature of these aMe neurons is their dense arborization in the AME and posterior lateral protocerebrum , where they anatomically interact with clock neuron dendrites  . Interestingly, the aMe neurons themselves receive strong inputs from the extraretinal photoreceptors."
"Specifically, aMe3 and aMe6a neurons receive strong inputs directly from the Hofbauer- Buchner  eyelets . Conversely, aMe8 receive indirect inputs from ocellar retinula cells via the ocellar ganglion neurons  type 2c  . This suggests that the clock receives strong light inputs from extrinsic photoreceptor cells, albeit indirectly."
"This is not surprising since light is the most important Zeitgeber for circadian clocks . Flies synchronize their circadian clocks with the light-dark cycles using these extrinsic photoreceptor cells as well as via the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome , which is expressed in about half of the clock neurons  . While CRY interacts with the core clock protein Timeless and can quickly reset the clock, the different photoreceptor cells are important for sensing dawn, dusk, high light intensities, and day length, and for adapting morning and evening activities to the appropriate time of day."
"Regardless, we found little direct inputs from the photoreceptor cells and other sensory cells to the clock neurons . This is consistent with previous findings which revealed that most of the light input to the clock appears to be indirect . In light of this and our in-silico circuit tracing analysis described above, we comprehensively characterized indirect connectivity between photoreceptor cells and clock neurons."
"Therefore, we traced all the disynaptic connections between them. Using the normal threshold of >4 synapses, we again recovered the strong connections from the H-B eyelets via the aMe3/aMe6a to the APDN3, and additional weaker connections to the s-CPDN3A, LNITP, l-LNv, and LNd CRY+ . Furthermore, we revealed connections from R7/R8 compound eye photoreceptors to several clock neurons via aMe12  and other interneurons."
"While we did not observe any disynaptic connections from the ocellar retinula cells to clock neurons using the normal threshold , reducing the threshold to >2 synapses revealed connections from the ocelli to APDN3 and l-CPDN3 via OCG02c . The synaptic connections from the ocelli to OCG and beyond are extensively characterized in our companion paper and demonstrate interesting details that may also be valid for the other photoreceptor inputs to clock neurons . The majority of ocellar photoreceptors are synaptically connected to ocellar ganglion neurons with thick axons  or directly to descending neurons ."
"These connections likely enable fast behavioral responses. In contrast, axons of OCG02c that connect to the clock neurons are rather thin and not suited for fast neurotransmission. Instead, these neurons appear suited for collecting light information over time – a property needed for entraining the circadian clock."
"Further, collecting light information over larger time intervals may not require a high synapse density. Thus, 3 to 4 synapses between retinula cells and the relevant downstream OCG observed here could be sufficient for this purpose . The same is also true for the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes."
"Reducing the threshold of significant connections from 5 to 3 synapses revealed indirect clock input from additional photoreceptor cells, including those that project from the dorsal rim area of the eye . These photoreceptor cells are involved in polarized vision and might contribute to time-compensated sun compass orientation . Whether the connectivity observed with a lower threshold of >2 synapses is functional in vivo remains to be seen; however, this is very likely since there are usually many photoreceptor cells that synapse onto only a few aMe neurons."
"For example, theoretically, the ~300 pale R8 cells project to only 3-4 aMe12 neurons , resulting in ~100 connections on average per aMe neuron. Even if each of these connections were mediated via only 3 synapses, each aMe neuron could potentially receive inputs from R8 cells via 300 synapses, which is quite substantial . In-silico anterograde tracing of clock neurons Delineating the output pathways that translate daily 24-hour oscillations of the molecular clock into physiological and behavioral rhythms remains a major focus in chronobiology."
"Using the same strategy as above to identify the inputs, we systematically classified all the neurons downstream of the clock network. Most synaptic output from the clock network is directed to intrinsic brain neurons, and in particular, the central brain neurons . Except for l-LNv, all clock clusters have a majority of their output onto central brain neurons."
"l-LNv mostly provide inputs to Medullary intrinsic neurons in the optic lobe , consistent with their role in adapting the sensitivity of the visual system to the time of day . Further, the majority of the output from DN1pA is onto visual projecting and central brain neurons that are part of the clock network . After broadly classifying clock outputs, we next focused on specific cell types which receive the strongest synaptic inputs  from clock neurons using an approach similar to the one used earlier for clock inputs."
"Our analysis identified the enigmatic Clamp neurons , which receive strong synaptic inputs from APDN3. While the functions of most of these clamp neurons are still unknown, some of them output onto descending neurons, while others promote sleep . Moreover, DN1pB provide strong inputs to Tubercleinnervating neurons , which are part of the anterior visual pathway ."
"Lastly, several clock neurons are strongly connected to diverse neurons from different neuropil regions . Next, we examined clock inputs to descending neurons which could influence locomotor and other behaviors regulated by neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, clock neurons provide direct inputs to 18 descending neurons ."
"These descending neurons include those which have not yet been classified , as well as Allatostatin-C  and SIFamine  peptidergic neurons , the latter of which modulate feeding, mating, and sleep . Direct synaptic inputs to downstream descending neurons predominantly derive from s-CPDN3A-D, and LPN . When considering disynaptic connections, the connectivity between the clock network and descending neurons increased drastically, with approximately 24% of all descending neurons receiving indirect inputs from most of the clock neurons ."
"In summary, our connectivity analysis indicates that the clock can have a major influence on diverse behaviors, including locomotion, via outputs to descending neurons. In addition, the circadian clock is also known to modulate behaviors such as activity/sleep, spatial orientation, and learning and memory . These behaviors are regulated by higher brain centers such as the central complex and mushroom bodies."
"Consistent with previous results , we found few direct connections from the clock to neurons associated with the central complex  and mushroom bodies . Consequently, we predicted that the clock output to these higher coordination centers is either indirect or paracrine via neuropeptides. In line with this prediction, we found prominent disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and central complex neurons  and ellipsoid body neurons ), as well as between clock neurons and Kenyon cells , dopaminergic neurons  and mushroom body output neurons  ."
"In support of paracrine signaling, receptors for several clock neuropeptides are also enriched in higher brain centers . Taken together, circadian modulation of neurons regulating diverse behaviors is largely indirect or paracrine. Similarly, we observed very few direct connections between clock neurons and endocrine cells which influence organismal physiology and systemic homeostasis ."
"We address this connectivity in more detail below. Identification and characterization of the neuroendocrine center in the FlyWire connectome While recent work has unraveled some clock output pathways to endocrine cells, our collective understanding of the circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms is poor . To address this knowledge gap, we first identified and classified all endocrine or NSC in the brain which are a major source of circulating hormones."
"These endocrine cells can be broadly classified into lateral, medial, and subesophageal zone NSC  based on their location in the brain. Their axons exit the brain via a pair of nerves , and depending on the cell type, innervate the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata, hypocerebral ganglion, crop, aorta, or the anterior midgut . Their axon terminals form neurohemal sites through which hormones are released into the circulation or locally on peripheral targets such as the crop."
"Collectively, the NSC form a major, yet distributed, neuroendocrine center that is functionally analogous to the hypothalamus . We identified all brain NSC in the FlyWire connectome by isolating the nerve bundle containing their axons . In total, we independently identified 80 brain NSC , in agreement with our companion studies ."
"We propose and utilize a systematic nomenclature for all brain NSC based on their location and neuropeptide identity . While all adult SEZ-NSC and some l-NSC can easily be classified based on their morphology and location , this approach is not feasible for m-NSC since they are clustered together in the superior medial protocerebrum and appear similar based on gross morphology. Therefore, we asked whether cosine similarity-based clustering, such as the one used previously for clock neurons, can be used to distinguish and identify different m-NSC clusters, as well as the l-NSCCRZ cluster."
"As expected, SEZ-NSCHugin, SEZNSCCapa, and l-NSCDH31 form three separate clusters . Most l-NSCITP  do not have any input synapses in our dataset and were thus excluded from this analysis. Notably, this analysis resulted in two clusters of m- NSC comprising 4 and 6 neurons each."
"Hence, these clusters likely represent m-NSCDMS and m-NSCDH44, respectively . We obtained two additional clusters of m-NSC comprising 18 and 12 neurons, with the latter having low similarity between the neurons. The cluster comprising 18 m-NSC represents IPCs ."
"Whether all cells in this cluster express DILP2,3 and 5 remains unknown; however, DILP2 is expressed in more than 14 neurons in adults . Interestingly, we could only reliably identify 6 out of the expected 14 l-NSCCRZ . These 6 neurons cluster into two separate clades  as they represent a heterogenous population both anatomically and functionally ."
"Our inability to identify the remaining 8 CRZ neurons inspired us to examine if these adult-specific CRZ neurons are indeed neurosecretory. Using Gr64a-Gal4 to label the adult-specific CRZ neurons , we showed that there are only 6 adult l-NSCCRZ . Contrary to our expectation, the adult-specific CRZ neurons do not project via the NCC and are thus not endocrine."
"Hence, our clustering analysis accounts for all the NSC that persist into adulthood. Additionally, it uncovered 12 putative m-NSC and 14 putative l-NSC in the adult brain . These neurons have smaller somata compared to other identified NSC  and have relatively fewer dense core vesicles than neurons such as l-NSCITP ."
"Hence, the type  and the identity of the signaling molecules within these neurons remain unknown. Informed by these new insights on different subgroups of NSC, we first explored potential inputs from clock neurons. Intriguingly, we observed sparse direct inputs from clock neurons to most NSC , despite clock neuron projections being closely associated with NSC dendrites in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum."
The only exceptions are l-NSCDH31 which receive inputs from LNITP and s-CPDN3B. . This observation prompted us to examine other types of synaptic inputs to NSC to ensure that the lack of synaptic connectivity between the clock network and NSC was not due to false negatives.
"Consistent with the location of m-NSC dendrites in the tritocerebrum , a large portion of their inputs derive from central, ascending and sensory neurons . Therefore, a lack of direct clock output to the NSC is genuine, and this connectivity is likely indirect or paracrine in nature. To explore the extent of indirect connections, we examined disynaptic connectivity between clock neurons and NSC."
"Approximately 43% of the clock neurons provide inputs to half of the NSC disynaptically. The interneurons which facilitate these connections mainly include central neurons  and descending neurons . Taken together, these prominent indirect connections between the clock network and NSC could form the basis of circadian regulation of systemic physiology."
"Identifying the molecular basis of paracrine clock output pathways Given the large repertoire of neuropeptides previously shown to be expressed in clock neurons , we predicted that peptidergic combined with immunohistochemical localization and T2AGal4 lines. Unsupervised clustering of all clock neuron transcriptomes using t-SNE analysis yields 32 independent clusters , 16 of which have high expression of clock genes  and can be reliably identified based on known markers . Our analysis revealed that most clock clusters express at least one neuropeptide ."
"Consistent with previous studies, l-LNv express high levels of Pdf, whereas s-LNv express both Pdf and short neuropeptide F  . Similar coexpression of neuropeptides is also observed in other clusters including the “DN1p CNMa & AstC” cluster which coexpresses CNMamide , AstC, and Dh31 neuropeptides. In total, at least 12 neuropeptides are highly expressed in the clock network ."
"Importantly, this includes novel clock-related neuropeptides, namely DH44 and Proctolin . Dh44 is expressed in several clock clusters including DN1a, DN1p AstA, DN1p sNPF, DN3 VGlut, LPN and LNd NPF . We independently confirmed the presence of DH44 peptide in these clusters using a combination of DH44 antibody or DH44-T2A-Gal4 ."
"Proc, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in the DN1p CNMa and weakly in DN2 clusters which was verified by driving GFP using a Proc-T2A-LexA driver . Proc expression in other clock clusters such as LNd NPF and DN3 VGlut, remains to be validated. Lastly, we also detected AstC expression in additional clock neurons."
"AstC immunoreactivity was previously localized in DN1p, DN3, and LPN , which is in agreement with AstC transcript expression in DN1p Rh7 and DN1p CNMa & AstC clusters . Here, we show that AstC is additionally expressed in DN2, which were labeled using an antibody against VRI . Our expression analyses revealed the comprehensive neuropeptide complement of clock neurons  and provides the basis to explore paracrine targets of clock neurons."
"As a first step in this direction and to validate our approach, we focused on select NSC which have been extensively characterized previously. We predicted that NSC are targeted by clock-related neuropeptides since they receive sparse monosynaptic inputs from clock neurons despite being closely associated with them anatomically. To investigate potential paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC, we again turned our attention to singlecell transcriptomics."
"We identified single-cell RNA transcriptomes of m-NSCDH44, m-NSCDILP, l-NSCCRZ, l- NSCDH31, and l-NSCITP  based on previously identified markers, and quantified the expression of clock peptide receptors . We could not reliably mine m-NSCDMS due to the lack of multiple molecular markers. We also disregarded SEZ-NSCCapa and SEZNSCHugin from this analysis since they are much further away from clock neuron projections."
"Consistent with our prediction, our analysis indicated that multiple receptors for clock peptides are indeed expressed in NSC. Modulatory inputs to m-NSCDILP have been examined extensively and our analysis is in agreement with previous expression and functional studies . Taken together, our analysis uncovers the molecular substrates of paracrine signaling between clock neurons and NSC."
"We next explored the magnitude of peptidergic paracrine signaling between clock neurons themselves. To predict putative paracrine connections, we extensively mapped the expression of clock neuropeptide receptors within the clock network. Consistent with promoter and genomic fragmentbased Pdfr-Gal4 expression , Pdf receptor  transcript is highly enriched in most clock clusters , which we verified independently by expressing GFP using Pdfr[RA]-T2A-Gal4 ."
"Other receptors are more sparsely expressed within the clock network . However, most clock clusters express at least two receptors, with DN1p sNPF expressing at least 7 receptors. We validated our single-cell transcriptome analysis by mapping the expression of select receptors using T2A-Gal4 knock-in lines."
"Our anatomical mapping of receptors  is largely in agreement with transcriptome data. In some cases, however, receptor mapping can provide additional insights. For instance, there are four transcript variants  encoding the Drosophila Neuropeptide F receptor ."
"Using Gal4 lines specific for NPFR-A/C and NPFR-B/D isoforms, we showed that these isoforms are differentially expressed across the clock clusters, with A/C isoforms expressed more broadly than B/D isoforms . Finally, we utilized our expression data of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors in clock neurons to delineate putative paracrine signaling pathways within the network. For this, we utilized an approach  similar to the one used recently to predict the Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide connectome ."
"Briefly, we used expression data based on independent methods to conservatively localize the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors across all the clock clusters. We also utilized the connectome to factor in the distance between neurons of different clusters. This was done to ensure that the cells releasing the peptide and those expressing its receptor are not further apart than a cut-off of 14μm, which was set based on a previous paracrine connectivity study ."
"Lastly, we only considered strong peptide-receptor interactions by disregarding ligands with EC50 values for receptor activation higher than 500nM. This stringent in silico approach allowed us to predict paracrine connectivity within the clock network with high confidence. Taking s-LNv as an example, this cluster expresses both PDF and sNPF."
"Following our expression thresholding, PDFR is expressed in most clock clusters, whereas sNPF receptor is expressed in DN1p, DN3, LPN and l-LNv . Thus, in addition to providing synaptic inputs to DN3, s-LNv can potentially provide paracrine inputs to most clock clusters across both hemispheres . Connectivity from l-LNv is also enhanced by paracrine signaling, although not to the same extent as it is for s-LNv."
"Expanding this analysis to other clock clusters allowed us to comprehensively identify putative peptidergic signaling pathways between clock clusters . These pathways, however, can only be considered putative for three main reasons:  all clock neuropeptides are also expressed in other non-clock neurons , suggesting likely inputs from neurons extrinsic to the clock network,  we don’t account for peptide efficacies and receptor affinities since these values were independently determined in distinct systems thus making comparisons difficult and  despite our best efforts to account for it, distance of peptide diffusion may vary. Nonetheless, the presence of receptors for clock peptides in other clock neurons provides the molecular basis for potential paracrine signaling between them."
"In summary, peptidergic signaling greatly enriches the connectivity between different subsets of clock neurons. Additional investigations are necessary to determine which of these putative connections are functional in vivo. Discussion Peptidergic signaling supplements synaptic connectivity within the circadian clock network Using a multipronged approach centered around the Fly- Wire connectome , we describe the first whole-brain neural connectome of an animal circadian clock."
"Our analysis using the complete brain connectome eluded identification of one DN2, and a couple of s-CPDN3. Nevertheless, given the fact that we identified almost all of the expected clock neurons as well as several additional DN3 , our clock neuron synaptic wiring diagram is complete enough to be regarded as a connectome. Our clock connectome is also a significant upgrade  compared to the partial connectivity diagram based on the hemibrain connectome reported earlier ."
"The previous analysis was based on only 24 clock neurons and largely focused on LN clusters, while excluding l-LNv, and several DN1p, DN2, and DN3 clusters due to the incomplete nature of the dataset. However, as evident from our analysis here, the DN in fact represent an important hub in the clock network and display high synaptic connectivity. In particular, DN1p play a large role in clock cluster interconnectivity and DN3 appear important for clock output pathways."
"Our analysis also sheds light on the precise number of DN3 in the clock network. Although approximately 80 DN3 were previously estimated in the entire clock network, there are in total about 170 DN3 based on our connectome and anatomical analyses. We anticipate that resources such as NeuronBridge , which allow for comparisons between electron and light microscopy datasets, will facilitate the identification of Gal4 drivers that target the novel s-CPDN3 subtypes identified here."
"In addition, we also characterized the molecular basis for neuropeptide connectivity between the clock neurons, consequently highlighting putative peptidergic pathways within the clock network. Similar to vertebrates , the Drosophila clock network is highly peptidergic, with all clock neuron clusters expressing at least one neuropeptide. Notably, a majority of the clock clusters express two neuropeptides, and several express three, while the LPN express four neuropeptides."
"Similar neuropeptide coexpression is also evident in SCN neurons and thus appears to be a common feature of clock neurons . Surprisingly, there is little to no overlap in the neuropeptide complement of the Drosophila and vertebrate clock neurons . Orthologs of vertebrate clock neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide, arginine vasopressin, neuromedin S, cholecystokinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, and prokineticin 2 are either absent in the Drosophila genome or expressed outside the clock network."
"Hence, Drosophila and vertebrates have evolved to utilize different signaling molecules while still conserving the diversity of neuropeptide signaling within the clock networks. Remarkably, except for PDF, there appears to be little conservation in neuropeptide identities of clock neurons across different insects . This suggests that it is more important to conserve the mode of communication  rather than the messenger ."
"Contralateral connectivity within the network prevents decoupling of clock neurons across the hemispheres Analysis of interconnectivity within the clock network revealed extensive contralateral synaptic connectivity between the clock neurons, which is largely mediated by DN1pA and to a lesser extent by s-CPDN3C, s-CPDN3D, l- CPDN3, and LNITP. Furthermore, paracrine peptidergic signaling amongst clock neurons has the potential to further strengthen this contralateral connectivity. Such a strong bilateral coupling of clock neurons prevents the internal two hemispheres – a phenomenon that can happen in other insects and even in mammals, but so far has not been observed in fruit flies ."
"In addition, consistent with previous analysis using the hemibrain connectome , we did not observe any synaptic connectivity between the s-LNv and the LNd neurons, which control morning and evening activities, respectively. In line with this observation, the phase relationship between morning and evening oscillators is plastic, consequently facilitating seasonal adaptations as in mammals . Our data may also explain how the morning and evening oscillators in flies internally desynchronize under certain conditions ."
"One such relevant condition is increased PDF signaling during long days , which was shown to delay the evening oscillators  and may lead to internal desynchronization . Here, we confirm the presence of PDFR in the evening neurons. Thus, enhanced PDF signaling could delay the evening neurons and bring them out of phase with the morning neurons, especially because the two sets of neurons are not connected via synapses."
"Taken together, the lack of interconnectivity between s-LNv and LNd could potentially be a factor promoting adaptation to different seasons and contexts. Light and other inputs to Drosophila and vertebrate circadian clocks Our analyses reveal that extrinsic light input from the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, HB eyelets, and ocelli to the clock neurons is largely indirect, with the former two transmitting light inputs via aMe neurons. This situation may appear to be different from mammals where intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the retina project directly through the retinohypothalamic tract onto the SCN neurons  ."
"However, even the mammalian clock receives indirect photoreceptor inputs from rods and cones via bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, indirect light inputs may reach the SCN also via the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus . Altogether, this suggests that the fly and mammalian system are not fundamentally different."
"One apparent difference is the presence of CRY, a cell-autonomous circadian photoreceptor, in subsets of Drosophila clock neurons that is sufficient for light entrainment in eyeless mutants . Mammals lack light-sensitive CRY. Instead, they possess light-sensitive melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells, and mice lacking rods and cones can still entrain to light/dark cycles due to melanopsin ."
"Thus, flies and mice possess several redundant and partly parallel light-input pathways to entrain their clocks. The similarity is even higher when comparing flies with vertebrates in general. For instance, fish, birds, and reptiles possess additional photoreceptors in the pineal gland, which is reminiscent of the extraretinal HB eyelets or even the ocelli of flies ."
"Most importantly, vertebrates and flies use their eyes for both vision and entraining their circadian clocks, tasks that require completely different properties of light inputs. Vision requires image formation and fast neurotransmission, whereas circadian entrainment is dependent on integrating light collection over a longer time that can be at a slower rate. The connectome reveals that the number of synapses as well as the axon thickness of the neurons mediating this connectivity are very different between the two types of photoreception."
"Hence, they are aptly suited to perform their required functions. Paracrine modulation of the neuroendocrine system by circadian clock Since circadian control of organismal physiology is likely mediated via hormones, in parallel with the clock connectome, we also identified the cells that make up the neurosecretory center of an adult Drosophila brain. This neurosecretory center is comprised of 80 endocrine cells, located in distinct regions of the brain and having unique neuropeptide identities."
"Neurosecretory connectomes of larval Drosophila and the marine annelid, Platynereis dumerilii have been established previously . Unfortunately, these studies did not examine the connectivity between the circadian clock and the neuroendocrine centers. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the largely indirect and paracrine signaling between the adult Drosophila circadian network and NSC is a phenomenon conserved across other animals."
"However, given the relatively slow timescales at which the circadian output needs to be propagated to downstream neurons, neuropeptides seem suited for this role. Limitations of our approach The novel synaptic and putative paracrine connections reported here can only be considered predictions until they are functionally verified. In the case of paracrine connectivity, functional connectivity experiments  using electrophysiological methods or genetically encoded secondary messenger sensors  are needed to confidently establish functional paracrine connectivity."
"Additionally, the synaptic connectivity reported here is likely an underestimation due to several factors: 1) we did not explore connectivity via gap junctions, 2) approximately 30% of synapses are missing for photoreceptors  and 3) we generally used a connectivity threshold of >4 synapses. Preliminary expression analysis using the single-cell transcriptomes of clock neurons suggests that gap junction genes are enriched in the clock network  and they can influence activity-rest rhythms . It remains to be seen which clock neurons are additionally coupled via gap junctions and how this electrical connectivity complements synaptic and peptidergic connectivity detailed here."
"Moreover, as discussed earlier, fewer than 5 synapses could also represent functional connections which were largely disregarded in our analyses. While the FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes exhibit a high degree of stereotypy, they are both based on an adult female brain. The lack of a male brain connectome currently prevents any comparisons on sex-specific differences within the circadian network and its output pathways which could influence sexually dimorphic behaviors and physiology."
"Further, the connectome provides a singular snapshot of connectivity which could change depending on the time of day, the age of the animal as well as its internal state. Conclusion In conclusion, our circadian clock connectome, the first of its magnitude, is a significant milestone in chronobiology. Given the high conservation of circadian network motifs between Drosophila and vertebrates, this connectome provides the framework to systematically investigate circadian dysregulation which is linked to various health issues in humans including sleep, metabolic, and mood disorders."
"Moreover, it will also facilitate the development and experimental validation of novel hypotheses on clock function. that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation."
The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown. We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. .
"In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons. Of these, more than half , are shared between the two circuits . We also examined bitter responsive neurons and Ir94e responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz."
"Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste . This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds4. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies29,46."
"To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity. We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water, and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9 . Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each the Drosophila feeding initiation circuit because it has well-defined taste sensory inputs and motor outputs that are contained in the Flywire electron microscopy volume."
"Thus, computational modelling of the feeding initiation circuit permits analysis of an entire sensorimotor circuit, in contrast to other sensorimotor circuits that require descending neurons, which are incomplete in the Flywire volume. Furthermore, gustatory sensory neurons that respond to sugar, water and bitter tastes have been identified in the electron microscopy volume23, permitting a detailed analysis of how these modalities interact. In addition, extensive experimental analysis provides a ground truth for computational studies4,5,23–32."
"We further assessed the performance of the model in another well-defined but non-overlapping circuit—the antennal grooming circuit—as an independent evaluation of the model6–10. As with the feeding initiation circuit, the antennal grooming circuit has well-defined sensory inputs, and a discrete, easily quantified behavioural output: antennal grooming behaviour. In both circuits, we tested specific predictions that the computational model generated using cell-type-specific genetic tools, optogenetics and functional imaging."
"We find that the model makes predictions consistent with our empirical observations, such as identification of neurons required for behavioural output. Thus, our computational model reduces the vast complexity of the connectome into simple, intuitive circuits. In Drosophila feeding initiation, detection of appetitive substances in hungry flies results in proboscis extension and consumption33."
"Gustatory receptor neurons  on the body surface of the fly, including the labellum  or the legs, respond directly to tastants and project to the primary taste centre of the insect brain—the suboesophageal zone 23,33–37. GRNs respond to specific taste categories, such as appetitive sugar or aversive bitter compounds, resulting in acceptance  or avoidance, respectively24,33,35,38. To examine the neural circuits that influence feeding in response to taste detection, we focussed on four GRN categories: sugar, water, bitter and a fourth GRN category labelled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e."
"Ir94e neurons respond to salt and the presentation of male genitals, but the exact tastants Ir94e neurons respond to are not well understood31,33,37,38. These GRNs have been identified and classified previously in the electron microscopy brain volume23; we verify and expand on this classification by clustering on the basis of connectivity and comparing this clustering with response properties of second-order neurons . When a fly encounters sugar, activation of appetitive GRNs results in activation of proboscis motor neurons  ."
"The proboscis consists of three segments: the rostrum, the haustellum and the lip-like labella, controlled by the activity of 16 MNs32. We find that computational activation of labellar sugar-sensing GRNs activates several proboscis MNs involved in feeding, including MNs 6, 8, 9 and 11 39. Consistent with the model’s predictions, MN9 and MN11 have been shown previously to respond to sugar stimulation in vivo5,39."
"In total, we find that the computational model can model a complete sensorimotor transformation. To assess the ability of our computational model to predict the composition and function of the feeding initiation circuit, we focussed specifically on the activity of MN9, which controls rostrum lifting during proboscis extension5,32. The rostrum is the largest portion of the proboscis, permitting quantification of MN9 activity by measuring rostrum lifting."
"Although the exact correlation between MN9 firing rate and rostrum lifting is not known, we assume that increased MN9 firing rates correspond with increased rostrum lifting probability. Remarkably, unilateral sugar GRN activation activates the contralateral MN9 more strongly compared with the ipsilateral MN9 when either the left  or the right  hemisphere GRNs are activated, consistent with behavioural experiments showing that unilateral taste detection on the legs promotes proboscis extension that is curved and directed towards the food source26,40. Thus, we show that in silico sensory activation produces MN activity that is consistent with the observed behaviour of the fly taste sensorimotor circuit."
"To confirm that our computational activation of MN9 depends on the actual connectivity weights determined from the fly connectome, we tested whether distorting synaptic weights would impair the ability of sugar sensory neurons to activate MN9. In these experiments, connectivity weights were shuffled randomly . Although modelling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did ."
"Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome. We next examined whether the computational model could accurately predict the neuronal cell types that are known to compose the feeding initiation circuit4. We first examined the neural network activated upon unilateral sugar GRN activation."
"We note that, given the variety of assumptions the model relies upon, absolute firing rate predictions are unlikely to be accurate; therefore, we examined network activity upon sugar GRN activation ranging from 10 to 200 Hz . We find that increasing sugar GRN firing rate increases activity of MN9, as well as MNs 6, 8 and 11. Of the 127,400 neurons modelled, we found that 45 are predicted to respond to 10 Hz sugar GRN activation, and 455 to 200 Hz ."
"Activated neurons are defined as neurons that have greater than 0 Hz firing. Thus, the computational model predicts a large network activated by sugar taste detection that includes known sugar-responsive MNs. Sugar taste detection influences activity in nutritive state and memory circuits, and modulates a broad range of behaviours, including feeding, oviposition and foraging33,37,41."
"To specifically evaluate the subset of predicted sugar-responsive neurons that influence feeding initiation, we performed two further in silico experiments. First, as a strategy to identify neurons that drive feeding initiation, we computationally stimulated each of the top sugar-responding neurons in the network to identify those that drive activity in MN9 . Second, to identify neurons required for feeding initiation to sugars, we computationally activated sugar GRNs, silenced each of the top 200 sugar-responsive neurons one at a time, and measured the change in predicted MN9 firing ."
"For these silencing experiments, we activated sugar-sensing neurons at frequencies ranging from 50 to 120 Hz in 10 Hz increments. Neurons that our model predicts to be required for feeding initiation will have decreased MN9 firing when silenced. We defined neurons predicted to cause a silencing phenotype as any neuron whose silencing causes MN9 firing to be 80% or lower compared with control MN9 firing at any of the eight sugar activation frequencies tested ."
"In general, silencing of individual neurons had the greatest effect when sugar GRNs were activated at low frequencies, implying greater redundancy in the circuit as sensory stimulation increases. In total, our analyses identified 47 neurons predicted to be sugar-responsive, and sufficient for feeding initiation. Of these 47 neurons, 14 are also predicted to be required for MN9 activity ."
"We next evaluated whether the predicted neurons for feeding initiation include neurons shown experimentally to participate in feeding initiation behaviour. Previous experimental studies identified ten neural classes that respond to sugar, and are sufficient for proboscis extension4 . Our computational model correctly predicts that all ten cell types respond to sugar ."
"Of these ten neurons, eight are predicted correctly to be sufficient to activate MN9  . We previously found that five of the ten are required for sugar feeding initiation4 . Of these five, three are predicted by our computational model to cause a greater than 20% decrease in MN9 firing, and one of the others is predicted to cause a statistically significant decrease in MN9 firing, but less than 20%, when silenced."
"Although the model predictions generally match previous experimental results, there are some deviations. For example, the model fails to correctly predict that the Phantom cell type will activate MN9  . This cell type is predicted to be inhibitory."
"Phantom strongly synapses onto Scapula—a neuron that is also predicted to be inhibitory; Scapula, in turn, synapses onto Roundup, the pre-MN with the strongest predicted silencing phenotype. We speculate that activation of Phantom inhibits Scapula, potentially permitting Roundup and MN9 firing. Because the basal firing rate of all neurons in the model is 0, activation of inhibitory neurons in the model, in the absence of other input, cannot alter the firing of downstream neurons."
"A further explanation for incorrect predictions could be neuromodulation, which is not accounted for in our model. Particular neurons may be subject to neuromodulation, causing their activity to be different from predictions on the basis of connectivity. Alternatively, neurons that express neuromodulators may be poorly modelled."
"We speculated that the Usnea cell type, which has a strong experimental activation and silencing phenotype4 yet is not predicted to be either necessary or sufficient for proboscis extension, might be neuropeptidergic. To test this, we performed cell-specific knockdown of the gene Amontillado—a prohormone convertase required for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila42,43. Knockdown of Amontillado phenocopied the Usnea silencing phenotype , indicating that Usnea activity may require neuropeptide processing."
"Additionally, incorrect neurotransmitter predictions or other assumptions of the model may explain discrepancies between the prediction of our model and our experimental results. Despite these limitations, overall, this analysis demonstrates that our computational model correctly identifies known neurons in a sensorimotor circuit. As an independent assessment of whether the computational model accurately predicts neurons that elicit MN9 activity, the output of our sensorimotor circuit, we compared optogenetic activation phenotypes with their corresponding computational activation phenotypes."
"To do this in a non-biased way, we performed a screen in which we optogenetically activated individual neuronal cell types with split-GAL4 lines and monitored the activity of MN9. The SEZ split-GAL4 collection labels 138 cell types in the SEZ—the primary feeding region of the brain44. We identified 106 of these labelled cell types in the Flywire volume."
"Next, we crossed these split-GAL4 lines to create flies expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson. We then optogenetically activated these neurons, and measured whether MN9 is activated by observing rostrum extension. We compared the predicted in silico MN9 activation phenotypes of these cell types when we activate them between 10 Hz and 200 Hz with the actual optogenetic activation MN9 phenotypes we observed."
"When we activate each cell type at 50 Hz, 11 are predicted to activate MN9 ; notably, 10 of 11 of these cell types actually do elicit rostrum extension when optogenetically activated . Furthermore, of the 95 predicted not to elicit proboscis extension due to 50 Hz activation, just 4 have non-zero rostrum extension. Activation of these cell types at 200 Hz, rather than 50 Hz, results in the addition of five false positives."
"At 10 Hz activation, six cell types are predicted to cause MN9 activation; of these five, six do indeed cause proboscis extension. Thus, the computational model can predict the activation phenotypes of a non-biased sample of cell types at greater than 90% accuracy. The accuracy of the model indicates that it provides a powerful platform to discover how different taste modalities are processed to influence feeding initiation."
"We first tested whether the model can predict the response to coactivation of both an attractive sugar stimulus and an aversive bitter stimulus. Bitter detection inhibits proboscis extension motor activity45 . Indeed, the addition of bitter GRN activity to sugar GRN activation in our model resulted in an inhibition of MN6 and MN9 ."
"We previously found, using calcium imaging, that bitter GRN activation inhibits the sugar pathway at the level of pre-MNs4, consistent with the predictions of the computational model . We next examined the predicted circuit activity caused by GRNs labelled by the ionotropic receptor Ir94e; these neurons have been identified previously in the electron microscopy volume23. Ir94e neurons respond to low salt concentrations and the presentation of male genitals, among other substances31,38, and are suggested to play a role in mediating attraction to low salt31."
"However, the role they play in proboscis extension has not been described. Notably, the computational model predicted that activation of Ir94e GRNs, rather than promoting MN9 firing, inhibits MN9 firing . Therefore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs is sufficient to inhibit proboscis extension, similar to bitter activation."
"Indeed, we found that optogenetic activation of Ir94e GRNs or bitter GRNs was sufficient to inhibit the proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose, as our modelling predicted . Interestingly, we noted a quantitative difference between the model’s predictions for bitter versus Ir94e activation. Strong bitter activation is predicted to eliminate MN9 firing to strong sugar stimulation, but strong activation of Ir94e neurons is not predicted to do so ."
"We therefore tested the proboscis extension response  to 1 M sucrose while optogenetically activating bitter or Ir94e GRNs. Optogenetic bitter activation eliminated consumption of 1 M sucrose , but Ir94e activation did not . Thus, we conclude that Ir94e GRN activity inhibits proboscis extension, but fails to fully inhibit proboscis extension to strong sugar stimuli."
"These results indicate that our computational model can predict previously unknown circuit functions and properties. Finally, we sought to predict how water taste detection influences feeding initiation. The degree to which sugar GRNs and water GRNs activate pathways that are distinct or shared is unknown."
"We found that activation of water GRNs in our model activates many downstream neurons that are also activated by sugar stimulation. . In particular, comparing neurons activated by sugar GRNs with those activated by water GRNs, at a stimulation frequency at which each pathway activates MN9 at 40 Hz, predicted that the sugar pathway activates 377 neurons, while the water pathway activates 391 neurons."
"Of these, more than half , are shared between the two circuits . We also examined bitter responsive neurons and Ir94e responsive neurons at the minimal activation sufficient to reduce 40 Hz MN9 firing to 1 Hz. Only two neurons were common between sugar and bitter activation, and 30 between sugar and Ir94e activation, demonstrating segregation of neurons activated by aversive and appetitive taste ."
"This prediction is consistent with our previous calcium imaging experiments demonstrating that, across nine sugar-responsive cell types, zero respond to a mixture of bitter compounds4. In contrast, our model predicts central neurons that respond to both sugar and water taste activation, as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons, consistent with brainwide calcium imaging studies29,46. To identify interneurons that compose the water feeding initiation circuit, we used the computational model to analyze the water-responsive neurons that influence MN9 activity."
"We stimulated the top 200 neurons that are predicted to respond to water, and identified the subset that computationally activates MN9 . Next, we also computationally activated water-sensing GRNs, silenced each water-responsive neuron, and monitored the change in MN9 activity . Using our computational model, we identified 39 water-responsive neurons that are also sufficient for MN9 activation."
"Of these 39, 30 are also predicted to be activated by sugar GRNs . Furthermore, we identify nine neurons predicted to be both necessary and sufficient for water feeding initiation . As with sugar, we defined a neuron predicted to be required for water feeding initiation as any neuron that, when silenced, caused MN9 firing to be less than 80% of that of the unsilenced control."
"To test these predictions experimentally, we performed calcium imaging on two neurons predicted to respond to water: Fudog and Zorro. We found that both neurons indeed responded to water . Additionally, we examined six neurons predicted to have water silencing phenotypes."
"Five of these, when silenced optogenetically, indeed decreased significantly proboscis extension to water, while a sixth, G2N-1, did not . We also examined five neurons that respond to computational water activation, but are not predicted to cause a water silencing phenotype. Of these five neurons, four did not have a water silencing phenotype, as predicted, although one, Usnea, did decrease proboscis extension significantly when silenced with GtACR1 ."
"Our computational model predicts that the water and sugar pathways share a common set of neurons . Do these shared neurons contribute to feeding initiation? Our calcium imaging experiments  combined with previous experiments4 confirm that five neurons predicted to respond to sugar and water do respond to both sugar and water in vivo: Clavicle, Fudog, Phantom, Rattle and Zorro."
"Moreover, four of these neurons had been shown previously to be sufficient for proboscis extension, and three are also required for sugar feeding initiation4. All three are among the neurons we found experimentally to be required for feeding initiation to water, as predicted . Furthermore, the two other cell types we found experimentally to be required for water—Bract and Roundup—are also predicted to respond to both water and sugar , and have been found to respond to sugar4."
"However, previous calcium imaging studies did not identify water responses in these two cell types4. This discrepancy may reflect the greater sensitivity of the behavioural silencing experiments compared with calcium imaging of water responses4. Finally, a further cell type, Usnea, has been shown to respond to water, but not sugar4; our model correctly predicts Usnea responds to water, but incorrectly predicts that it will also respond to sugar."
"Usnea has previously been shown to be required for feeding initiation to sugar, and our Amontillado RNAi experiments indicate that it may be neuropeptidergic. We find that it is also required for proboscis extension to water . Usnea synapses directly onto both sugar and water GRNs , and may tune the response of these neurons."
"Thus, we identify a set of neurons involved in the processing of both sugar and water. To explore the relationship between the water and sugar pathways, we computationally activated both sugar and water GRNs simultaneously and examined the effect on MN9. Our computational modelling predicts that activation of water and sugar GRNs work synergistically to promote MN9 firing ."
"If sugar and water do act synergistically, then both sugar GRNs and water GRNs may be involved in water consumption. Only water GRNs have been implicated in proboscis extension to water; we asked whether sugar GRNs might also be required. Indeed, silencing of sugar GRNs reduced the fraction of flies that extended their proboscis to water ."
"Further, silencing water-sensing neurons reduced consumption of 50 mM sucrose, although a confound is that these water-sensing neurons are known to respond to this concentration of sucrose . In total, our computational modelling, optogenetic behaviour experiments and functional imaging indicate that the water and sugar pathways share, at least in part, common components to form an appetitive consumption pathway. To test the general applicability of the computational model to study sensorimotor processing, we sought to determine whether it could predict circuit properties in another system—the well-studied antennal grooming circuit6–10."
"In this system, activation of a set of mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston’s organ—a chordotonal organ in the antennae—elicits grooming of the antennae8,47 . These mechanosensory neurons, abbreviated JONs, synapse onto two interneuron types, named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2 , which in turn synapse onto two descending neurons, aDN1 and aDN2 . There is a single aBN1 per hemisphere, while there are several aBN2 neurons per hemisphere."
"Each of these cell types—aBN1, aBN2, aDN1 and aDN2—are sufficient for antennal grooming, while aBN1 and aBN2 are each at least partially required for antennal grooming8. We first sought to test whether the computational model could identify the previously described neurons in the circuit. We activated a set of 147 previously identified JONs of the JO-C, JO-E, JO-F and JO-m subclasses8,47."
"Indeed, the model identified that aBN1, aBN2, aDN1 and aDN2 respond to JON activation . To determine which of these JON-responsive neurons might drive antennal grooming, we computationally activated these neurons and asked whether they could elicit activity in either of the two descending neurons that evoke antennal grooming: aDN1 or aDN2 . Next, we asked, among the top neurons predicted to respond to JON activation, which are required for activation of aDN1 or aDN2 ."
"Notably, only four neurons, beyond aDN1 itself, were identified that could elicit aDN1 activity: aBN1, aDN2 and two other neurons that elicited less than 2 Hz aDN1 activity . Moreover, only three neurons, besides aDN1 itself, were identified that reduced aDN1 activity by more than 20% at 140 Hz JON activation: aBN1; a descending member of the BN2 class; and aDN2 . Thus, the computational model identifies members of each of the previously identified critical nodes of the antennal grooming circuit purely from knowledge of the sensory inputs and descending outputs."
"We next tested how different JON subpopulations influence antennal grooming. JONs send their projections to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the ventral brain. JO-C and JO-E neurons respond to antennal vibrations and project medially into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, while JO-F neurons project into a distinct region8."
"Optogenetic activation of both JO-CE and JO-F neurons is sufficient to trigger antennal grooming, but it is not known whether these two populations generate distinct patterns of downstream firing. Both JO-CE and JO-F neurons synapse onto aBN1 , raising the possibility that they elicit grooming by activating aBN1. Our computational model predicts that, whereas JO-CE neurons will elicit robust aBN1 activity, JO-F neurons will not, despite synapsing directly onto aBN1 ."
"To test this prediction, we optogenetically activated each population of JONs and performed calcium imaging in aBN1. Consistent with the prediction of this model, JO-CE activated aBN1 robustly, but JO-F neurons did not . Why do JO-F neurons fail to activate aBN1 robustly?"
"We identified three putative inhibitory neurons that are directly postsynaptic to JO-F neurons and synapse directly onto aBN1. Computational silencing of these three neurons permits JO-F neurons to activate aBN1, but this remains to be tested empirically . Our analysis of the antennal grooming circuit demonstrates that our computational model can provide insights into complex circuits, purely from knowledge of sensory input and descending output."
"We demonstrate that modelling brain circuits purely from connectivity and neurotransmitter identity is sufficient to reliably describe, at least at a coarse level, entire sensorimotor transformations. In conclusion, we report a computational model on the basis of connectivity and neurotransmitter predictions of the entire fly connectome that can predict circuit neural activity, the neurons required for activation of output neurons and the integration of several sensory modalities. We use the model to create predictions of the sugar, water, bitter and Ir94e pathways and validate many of these predictions experimentally."
"We show that the Ir94e neurons, previously considered to be attractive, instead inhibit proboscis extension. The results of our modelling indicate that sugar, bitter and Ir94e GRNs activate generally distinct populations of neurons. In contrast, sugar and water GRNs activate many of the same central neurons as well as sugar-specific and water-specific neurons."
"In addition, we recapitulate the antennal grooming circuit purely from sensory input and descending output, and identify a subpopulation of JONs that, despite strong connectivity onto aBN1, fail to activate it. These studies demonstrate the power of computational modelling to explain sensory processing features in complex networks. Our analysis of the taste and antennal grooming circuits shows we can model local sensorimotor transformations in the taste and antennal grooming circuits."
"The computational model, implemented in the widely used Brian2 library22, allows for perturbations that are easily interpreted. We believe our computational model will be a useful tool for the study of sensorimotor transformations and the exploration of interactions between overlapping neural pathways . Connectome models We implement here a brainwide leaky integrate-and-fire model— one of the simplest biologically plausible neural models."
"The recent creation of connectome datasets has also coincided with methods to model these connectomes. Two different approaches have been used thus far to analyze the recent Drosophila hemibrain and larval connectomes13,16. First, graph theoretical approaches, such as the probabilistic graph traversal model13, or the signal cascade approach16 can be used to model information flow in the Drosophila brain."
"These models estimate the path length from one neuron to another on the basis of probabilistic traversal through the connectome depending on connection strength13,16. However, because these models measure traversal length, rather than a measure of activation, they are unlikely to be useful for predicting what neurons contribute most to a given circuit. A second approach is to train a deep neural network to perform a task, and measure how neurons in that model compare with actual neurons in the brain15,48."
"However, these approaches generally use markedly more free parameters , and need a clearly defined behavioural task. In contrast to these approaches, our computational model generates an intuitive readout, changes in spiking rates of neurons, with no training of the model necessary. The model permits hypotheses about the function of particular neurons, and allows for modelling of the interactions of circuits that were previously studied only in isolation."
"For example, by activating neurons involved in locomotion simultaneously with sugar-sensing neurons, which are known to inhibit locomotion, Sapkal et al. use our computational model to correctly identify neurons that regulate walking, thereby identifying circuits involved in foraging49. What are the requirements for our model to make accurate predictions, and what circuits or conditions might result in poor modelling?"
"Our model failed to predict behavioural results in the SEZ split-GAL4 screen  when the neurons tested were predicted to be inhibitory  or neuromodulatory . We conclude that circuits in which there is extensive basal inhibition, not captured by the model because of the zero basal firing rate, may be poorly simulated in our model. Further, circuits with extensive neuromodulation or extrasynaptic signalling will be poorly modelled."
"This is consistent with recent studies showing that activity propagation measured by calcium imaging is not well predicted by anatomical connectivity alone in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating the importance of extrasynaptic signalling not accounted for in our model50. Finally, precise dynamics may be poorly simulated by our computational model, although a similar LIF model accurately produced Drosophila ring attractor dynamics18. Drosophila taste coding Our computational and experimental results generate new contributions to our understanding of Drosophila taste coding."
"First, we identify that sugar and water form a shared attractive pathway. We have found previously that hunger impinges primarily at sugar-sensing neurons, and at select second-order neurons; water-sensing neurons also are tuned by thirst4. By altering the tuning of water- or sugar-sensing neurons at the periphery, followed by funnelling their activity onto a shared appetitive circuit, the Drosophila brain may allow for a compact representation of attractive tastants."
"We also find that Ir94e is an aversive taste modality; Ir94e GRNs in virgin females have been shown to respond to the presentation of male genitals38. Additionally, we find that bitter and Ir94e inhibit proboscis extension by impinging on pre-MNs. A strength of computational modelling in general is that it is explicit about its assumptions and limitations."
"In this simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, we treat each neuron identically as a spiking neuron and ignore neural morphology as well as different neurotransmitter receptor dynamics17. Furthermore, the model does not account for gap junctions, non-spiking neurons, internal state or long-range neuropeptides, and assumes that the basal firing of each neuron is zero51–55. In addition, the accuracy of the model is limited by the underlying synapse and neurotransmitter prediction accuracy3,21."
"Moreover, studies of the connectomes of C. elegans and the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion demonstrate that connectivity knowledge constrains, but does not dictate, a particular circuit mechanism56–58. Despite these limitations, the model performs remarkably well for the demonstrated use cases."
"Across 164 predictions we were able to test empirically, 91% were consistent with our empirical results . Excluding our optogenetic split-GAL4 experiments , in which the vast majority of cell types did not elicit MN9 activation, the accuracy of the model is 84% . Further refinements of our computational model, for example, more complete neurotransmitter or receptor information, or more sophisticated treatment of the morphology of each neuron, may improve the accuracy of future models."
"We show here that, in the intermediate complexity of the entire Drosophila brain, a simple connectome-based computational model can reliably describe entire sensorimotor transformations from sensory input to descending or motor output. Circadian rhythms in multiple aspects of cellular physiology help organisms across taxa, from unicellular cyanobacteria to multicellular animals, adapt to environmental day–night changes . In mammals, neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus  show circadian rhythms in gene expression, intracellular calcium, neural activity, and other cellular properties ."
"Circadian rhythms in SCN neuronal outputs coordinate circadian rhythms in other cells throughout the body and generate behavioral rhythms . The rhythms of SCN neuronal outputs can be generated cell intrinsically by the negative transcription/translation feedback loop of core clock genes as a molecular clock, which then generates 24-h oscillations in a series of genes . These gene oscillations then regulate different aspects of membrane physiology, such as the expression levels of channels for potassium, sodium, and calcium ."
"The mechanisms by which the molecular clockworks coordinate complex membrane physiology to generate neural activity rhythms within individual circadian pacemakers remain to be defined. Calcium signaling regulates many cellular processes, such as neural excitability, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression . Cytoplasmic calcium can be regulated from extracellular calcium influx as well as from intracellular calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum  and mitochondria ."
"Studies on SCN neurons in vitro  and recently, in vivo  measured circadian calcium rhythms  in SCN neurons. Some studies suggested that calcium rhythms were driven by neuronal firing and voltage-gated calcium channels , while others suggested they were driven by intracellular stores via the ER channel ryanodine receptor  . These alternative hypotheses may derive from the technical differences in the various studies, including the details of in vitro preparations, but also, due to a lack of single-cell resolution in the calcium measurements."
"In Drosophila, circadian pacemaker neurons also show clock-driven CCRs . The dynamics can be resolved across all five major pacemaker groups , and each group exhibits distinct and sequential daily peak phases. Within such groups, the rhythms can be measured in single identified cells ."
"The multihour phase diversity exhibited by this network requires a series of delays effected by environmental light and by noncell-autonomous modulation mediated by different neuropeptides . Precisely how neuropeptide signaling regulates calcium activity in pacemaker neurons over long  durations is unknown. To begin to understand these critical mechanisms of pacemaker modulation, we begin by addressing the cellular and molecular basis of pacemaker calcium rhythms with physiological, genetic, and behavioral measures."
"In this study, we again used in vivo calcium imaging at single-cell resolution, here using a high-speed light-sheet microscope termed OCPI-2 ; the acronym OCPI stands for objective-coupled planar illumination. OCPI-2 represents a fundamental technical advance because it permits sampling frequencies to capture stacks of large tissue volumes, without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Whereas OCPI-1 methods permitted us to sample a whole-brain volume once every 10 min across the 24-h day, OCPI-2 methods permit us to sample volumetrically at rates as high as 5 Hz."
"Thus, we simultaneously measured both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations at single-cell resolution over entire 24-h durations. We found circadian rhythmicity in both measures. We consider the fast fluctuations to represent events closely coupled to neuronal firing, as have previous studies conducted in much more restricted temporal durations  ."
"In all the Drosophila pacemaker neurons we studied, these two layers of calcium rhythms shared the same daily temporal pattern . To gain insights into the mechanism of these patterns, we exploited the fact that in Drosophila, many calcium channels are encoded by single genes , and we used genetics to study the roles of individual channels in generating daily pacemaker calcium rhythms. Here, we present results of experiments in which we knocked down RNAs encoding different calcium channels selectively in all or a subset of pacemakers."
"We evaluated the impact of individual channels in setting both slow daily changes in basal calcium levels and in fast fluctuations. Finally, we measured PERIOD  protein staining levels and behavior to determine which channels provide feedback to the molecular clock and which are required for normal circadian output from the pacemaker network. Results The Rhythms of Slow and Fast Calcium Activity Changes Show Similar Daily Patterns."
"Previously, we reported that five major groups of circadian pacemaker neurons each exhibit daily calcium rhythms with distinct phases . These results stand in apparent contrast to descriptions of synchronous daily electrical activity rhythms among three of these groups: s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1 . The electrical activity rhythms were recorded ex vivo from different brains isolated at four to six different time points of the day."
"In contrast, we measured calcium rhythms in vivo by scanning individual flies every 10 min for 24 h. Because of the close peak phases of calcium rhythms in s-LNv, l-LNv, and DN1   and because of the coarse sampling of electrophysiological studies, it is not certain whether calcium and electrical activity patterns are in fact distinct. To help clarify apparent differences in results derived from the two sets of studies, we began by performing short-term continuous in vivo calcium imaging  on fly brains that were exposed acutely before each imaging experiment at five different times of day."
"We focused on the LNd because this group has a phase of calcium rhythms most distinct from those of s-LNv, l- LNv, and DN1. In addition, the daily electrophysiological activity pattern of LNd has not previously been reported. We found that ∼0."
"1-Hz calcium fluctuations peaked at around the same ZT8 to ZT12 , at which time this pacemaker group shows peak intensity in its daily calcium rhythm . The time course of “fast”  calcium fluctuations in the late day suggests they might be caused by the calcium influx that occurs during single action potentials or bursts of them  . This result suggested that one or more LNd pacemakers exhibit a daily rhythm in electrical neural activity that is roughly cophasic with this pacemaker group’s slow daily calcium rhythm."
"Because the slow and fast calcium LNd rhythms are synchronous as measured, it is formally possible that one rhythm is downstream of the other; for example, the slow calcium rhythm could be the consequence of a rhythm in the fast. Alternatively, these two processes could be completely distinct. To better understand the relationships between the two and better describe their phases across the entire network, we performed a series of short-term  high-frequency  in vivo calcium imaging episodes at 1-h intervals using the light-sheet microscope dual-channel Objective Coupled Planar Illumination  ."
"In so doing, we tracked both slow basal calcium level and fast calcium fluctuations in the same individual neurons from all five major circadian pacemaker groups; we collected these data consecutively from single brains for entire 24-h durations . To ensure minimal disruption to the circadian clocks due to repeated optical scanning, we used cry01 flies for these experiments, which are null for the internal photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME . On average, all circadian neuron groups displayed slow calcium rhythms comparable with those we previously reported , except for l-LNv, which showed additional daily calcium activation peaks right after the time of lights off and again just before lights on."
"Nevertheless, all pacemaker groups displayed daily changes in the minimal calcium level, demonstrating that their basal calcium levels cycle with a daily rhythm . We found that within all five pacemaker groups, changes in basal calcium levels and in fast calcium fluctuations shared similar daily patterns; when basal calcium levels were high within a single pacemaker group, that group also exhibited largeramplitude fast calcium fluctuations . Power spectrum analysis clearly revealed that, for individual neurons within each pacemaker group, calcium activity at all frequency domains increased when the basal calcium level was high ."
"We asked whether the change in the incidence of high-frequency fluctuations, measured using the geneticallyencoded calcium reporter GCaMP6s could have a technical basis: specifically, whether it derives from a higher level of photon shot noise due to the higher baseline intensity. In order to normalize the effect of shot noise, we also calculated the intensity of the calcium signal as the square root of photon number collected from an individual region of interest . In this analysis, we still found daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations ."
"These results support the hypothesis that, in each circadian pacemaker group, fast calcium fluctuations exhibit a daily rhythmic pattern that is cophasic with a slow daily rhythm in basal calcium levels. An RNAi Screen to Identify Potential Contributions of Different Calcium Channels. The observations described above support the conclusion that for individual pacemakers, slow and fast calcium activities covary across the day."
"Yet, these observations do not reveal whether the two rhythms are mechanistically linked or represent independent functions. To identify the sources for different calcium rhythms and ask about their relatedness, we used RNA interference  methods to knock down different calcium channels. We performed a limited screen for calcium channels, including three subtypes of α1-subunits and one type of α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels."
"In addition, we tested two types of storeoperated calcium entry, dSTIM and dOrai, and two types of calcium channels on the ER, RyR and inositol trisphosphate receptor ; finally, we included the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump . By knocking down these genes selectively in circadian pacemaker neurons using tim-GAL4 or in a subset of eight pacemaker neurons that express the pigment dispersing factor neuropeptide  using pdf-GAL4, we first tested whether any of these genes are required for normal circadian behavioral rhythms. We found evidence for the involvement of three  as indicated by increases in the percentage of arrhythmic  flies tested under constant darkness ."
"Reduced expression of the α1T channel, which encodes the α1-subunit for the T-type voltagegated calcium channel, caused the strongest behavioral arrhythmicity when driven by either pdf-GAL4 or tim-GAL4  with one of the two RNAi lines tested . Likewise, knockdown of expression of the SERCA calcium pump caused strong arrhythmicity in two different RNAi lines. Yet, knocking down SERCA with the stronger RNAi line in all circadian pacemakers by tim-GAL4 also shortened the flies’ life spans; 69% of flies died during behavioral experiments."
"Knockdown of another calcium channel on the ER membrane, Itpr, also affected the circadian rhythm in behavior when driven by tim-GAL4. These behavioral deficits suggested that α1T, SERCA, and ITPR might be involved in the regulation of calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons. Slow Calcium Rhythms Require inositol trisphosphate receptor ."
"We then asked whether the α1T, SERCA, and ITPR channels that regulate circadian behavior also influence calcium rhythms. We measured GCaMP6 fluorescence during in vivo 24-h recordings in Drosophila knockdowns in all circadian neurons or in just the subset of PDF-positive ones . Although knocking down α1T caused the strongest behavioral deficits, the slow calcium rhythms of all pacemaker neuron groups in these flies were similar to those in the control genotypes."
"The amplitude of calcium rhythms in flies with α1T knocked down in all pacemaker neurons showed a nonsignificant trend of decrease to 59. 3% on average , while their activity phases were still normal . In contrast, when SERCA was knocked down in PDF neurons  or in all circadian neurons  , the slow calcium activities of these neurons were largely AR."
"The amplitudes of calcium fluctuations were decreased to 37. 8% on average , and the coherence was lost within groups . Likewise, the calcium rhythms were still normal when Itpr was knocked down in PDF neurons  but became largely AR when Itpr was knocked down in all circadian neurons ."
"In the latter case, the coherence of peak phase was lost within groups , consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the two manipulations for Itpr RNAi. Together, these results implicate SERCA and IP3R channel activities as essential for slow calcium rhythms and suggest that the ER may be a key calcium source for the daily fluctuations of the basal calcium levels in circadian pacemaker neurons. Because the slow calcium rhythms are driven by molecular clock gene oscillations , we asked whether the molecular clock controls slow calcium rhythms by regulating SERCA and/or ITPR levels."
"If SERCA and Itpr are downstream of the molecular clock, knocking down these genes would affect calcium rhythms and behavior but not affect the molecular clock itself. We examined PER protein levels in all five circadian pacemaker groups at four 12-h light:12-h dark  time points, and we found that PER cycling appeared robust in Itpr knockdown flies but was clearly diminished in SERCA knockdown flies . Therefore, in this system, only Itpr appears to operate principally downstream of the molecular clock and is necessary to generate daily rhythms in basal calcium levels."
"Fast Calcium Fluctuations Require α1T Calcium Channels and ITPR. Knocking down the RNA for α1T voltage-gated calcium channels in pacemaker neurons impaired circadian rhythms in behavior but did not affect circadian rhythmicity in basal calcium levels within those neurons. Therefore, we next asked whether α1T may underlie the circadian rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations in pacemakers."
"To test this, we again performed imaging across a series of short-term  high-frequency  calcium measurements on the same flies for a 24-h day with 1-h intervals . By comparing control Drosophila with those with α1T knocked down in all circadian pacemaker neurons by tim-GAL4, we found that knocking down α1T did not affect the daily rhythms in the basal  calcium level in any pacemaker group except for the DN1, which showed a reduction in the day–night difference of the basal calcium level . These high-frequency measures of slow basal calcium levels largely conform with those obtained with the slow-frequency  recording sessions ."
"However, the high-frequency recording revealed that fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the α1T knockdown flies, except for l-LNv . That specific pacemaker group instead displayed higher levels of fast calcium fluctuations. These results indicated that, at least in the majority of circadian pacemaker neurons, α1T is required for strong daily rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations and that the rhythm of fast calcium fluctuations can be selectively impaired."
"We then asked whether the fast calcium fluctuations are also affected in flies with Itpr knocked down in all pacemaker neurons. We performed the same high-frequency calcium imaging and analysis in Itpr knockdown flies  as in α1T knockdown flies. The daily variation of pacemaker calcium was greatly reduced in Itpr knockdown flies , which largely recapitulated previous observations with less frequent sampling ."
"In addition, fast calcium fluctuations were significantly reduced in all circadian pacemaker neurons of the Itpr knockdown flies . These results suggested that rhythms in basal calcium levels, regulated by ITPR, may be necessary for rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations. Discussion In this study, we used in vivo 24-h high-frequency calcium imaging and genetic screening to study the cellular biology of daily calcium rhythms in circadian pacemaker neurons of Drosophila."
"We found that the calcium rhythm is in fact a composite; it reflects daily fluctuations in both a slow component  and a fast one . We interpret fast calcium fluctuations as representations of calcium dynamics that occur as neurons fire single action potentials or bursts of them. While it is not sufficient to resolve single action potentials, GCaMP6-induced fluorescence is a good index of neuronal electrical activity ."
"For individual identified pacemakers, these two calcium rhythms share the same daily pattern, yet distinct calcium sources appear to contribute differentially to these two rhythms. An extracellular calcium influx, through plasma membrane calcium channels that include the α1T subunit, is critical for the fast calcium fluctuations. In contrast, calcium fluxes from the ER via the channel ITPR are required for both the slow rhythms in the basal calcium levels and the fast ones."
"Importantly, both channels are essential for normal circadian behavior. Thus, the molecular clocks may drive circadian rhythms in pacemaker neuron output by regulating different calcium sources to generate coordinate but distinct rhythms in its calcium activities. CCRs are widespread across taxa ."
"Calcium rhythms are required for circadian pacemaker functions in both rodents and Drosophila . Studies on mammalian circadian pacemakers in the SCN are controversial regarding the temporal relationship between the CCR and rhythms in electrical activity, such as in spontaneous firing rate  and in resting membrane potential . Recordings from SCN slice cultures showed that the phases of CCR in individual pacemakers are diverse and could be different from the populational phase of SFR rhythms ."
"However, the populational SFR phase is composed of many diverse phases of SFR rhythms on the individual cell level ; it is unclear whether SFR phases align with the phases of CCR. Imaging with both voltage sensor and calcium sensors in SCN slices, Brancaccio et al. concluded that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase, yet Enoki et al."
"concluded that RMP rhythms and CCR were in phase in the ventral SCN but that in dorsal SCN, the CCR phase led the RMP rhythms by ∼2 h. Because the voltage sensor signal measured from dorsal SCN may derive from the neural processes of ventral SCN neurons, the cellular interpretation of these results is unclear. Another source for the inconsistency might be the culture conditions; in fact, when SCN neurons were recorded in vivo by photometry, the rhythms in fast calcium activity were in phase with slow calcium rhythms ."
"In general, comparisons of population rhythms and rhythms in single cells are not easily reconciled. Our recordings that tracked pacemaker neurons from different identified groups in vivo for 24 h showed that at the single cell level, slow calcium rhythms  were unambiguously in phase with rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations; the latter likely reflects rhythms in SFR . To measure the fast calcium fluctuations, we employed a high-frequency light-sheet scanning microscope termed OCPI- 2 ."
"OCPI-2 resolved limitations present in previous microscope designs that created a bottleneck in terms of the rate at which tissue volumes can be repeatedly scanned. Importantly, it does so without compromising photon efficiency or spatial resolution. Its use here was instrumental in letting us sample the whole-brain volume at frequencies as high as 5 Hz periodically throughout the day."
"As before , we were mindful that the wavelength and amount of total incident light may activate pacemaker neurons and alter molecular clocks . We used cry01 flies to avoid the direct light responses of pacemaker neurons and found that all pacemaker groups displayed slow calcium rhythms, with patterns that were comparable with those we previously reported , except for that of l-LNv . That group displayed an additional calcium peak in the early evening and another just before lights on."
"Because l-LNv innervates the optic lobes and receives large-scale visual inputs , we speculate that the repeated optical scanning might anomalously activate l-LNv in the evening via visual systems. In the later experiments, when we reduced the illumination duration per hour from 31. 5 s   to 2."
"4 s  , l-LNv did not show the additional evening peaks; this was true even when measured in flies wild type for cry. Shorter durations of light exposure permit all pacemaker groups to display slow calcium rhythms  with phases similar to those obtained with the slow-frequency  recording sessions . Therefore, the concern to avoid technical artifacts when imaging from light-sensitive pacemaker appears especially acute in the case of l-LNv."
"Nevertheless, by carefully tuning the illumination intensity for calcium imaging, we propose that it is possible to monitor normal slow calcium rhythms and fast calcium fluctuations from the same individual pacemaker neurons. The causal relationships between clock gene rhythms, calcium rhythms, and electrical activity rhythms in the SCN remain generally unresolved. Treating SCN slices with Tetrodotoxin  diminished SFR rhythms , partially affected RMP rhythms and CCRs , and slowly affected clock gene rhythms over several days ."
"Dispersed SCN cells in vitro showed a TTX-resistant CCR, suggesting that CCR is driven by clock gene rhythms . Thus, the variation in CCR sensitivity to TTX treatment might be caused by the degree to which clock gene rhythms in vitro become progressively dysfunctional. In Drosophila, our findings suggested that clock gene rhythms drive two components of the CCR—both basal calcium levels and fast calcium fluctuations—via circadian regulation of the ER channel ITPR and membrane voltage-gated calcium channel α1T."
"Both channels might then contribute to SFR and RMP rhythms. Similarly, in SCN pacemakers, pharmacologically blocking another ER channel RyR affected both CCR and SFR rhythms , suggesting that rhythms in basal calcium levels are regulated by calcium from ER and are required for fast electric activity rhythms. In addition, SCN pacemakers also showed a circadian rhythm in fast calcium activity mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels ."
"Pharmacologically blocking these membrane channels affected SFR rhythms and in some case, affected CCR . In our studies, manipulating a membrane voltage-gated calcium channel in all or a subset of pacemakers selectively affected rhythms in fast calcium fluctuations, which likely reflected SFR rhythms and thus, impaired circadian outputs; however, it did not significantly affect the slow rhythms in basal calcium levels . Manipulating the ER calcium channel IP3R in all pacemakers affected rhythms in both slow and fast calcium rhythms."
"Therefore, in parallel to mammalian SCN neurons, Drosophila circadian pacemakers generate calcium rhythms by regulating both ER and extracellular calcium sources. Since our results suggest little or no role for the RyR channel , the daily rhythmic regulation in fly pacemakers likely acts on a different set of ER and cytoplasmic membrane channels from those in mammalian pacemakers. We also presented RNAi evidence implicating the Itpr and Ca-alpha1T genes in pacemaker cell calcium fluxes."
"However, for each, only a single RNAi proved effective in reducing rhythmic power and increasing percentage of arrhythmicity. Corroboration for our findings is provided by a prior report , which found that the same RNAi line we used decreases Itpr RNA levels. Likewise, we find corroboration in a prior report by Jeong et al."
", who described a specific Ca-alpha1T insertion line as a protein null mutation that exhibited reduced percentage of rhythmicity and power in DD but without a change in circadian period or in the daily per rhythm. They concluded that Ca-alpha1T expression does not affect the central clock mechanism and surmised instead that it likely affects the output of the circadian system, specifically via a requirement for the channel to permit normal physiological activation of pacemaker neurons. That work provides independent genetic confirmation of our RNAi results, and its conclusions align precisely with our own."
"The RNAi knockdown experiments indicate a role for the ER calcium channel SERCA in supporting slow calcium rhythms in Drosophila pacemakers and behavioral rhythms. However, SERCA knockdown also produced high rates of lethality and among survivors, strong effects on the PER molecular oscillation. We conclude that SERCA, which maintains the ER cytoplasmic calcium gradient, is essential for the normal physiology of the cells but that these additional phenotypes precluded an assessment of its precise role in circadian rhythmicity."
"In contrast to the situation with SERCA, our results support a hypothesis that ITPR is a crucial actuator of the molecular clock. Previous transcriptomic analysis also supports that possibility; in circadian neurons, Itpr displays rhythmic expression, while SERCA does not  . Knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons  generally caused stronger deficits in both behavioral rhythms and calcium rhythms than in just the PDF-positive neurons ."
"One possibility might be that the RNAi expression level is lower when driven by pdf-GAL4 than when driven by tim-GAL4. However, in SI Appendix, Fig. S5A, knocking down Itpr in all circadian neurons caused stronger deficits in the amplitude of calcium rhythms of non–PDF-positive neurons  than in those of PDF-positive neurons ."
"Hence, a difference in the vulnerability to IP3R disruption between PDF-negative and PDF-positive neurons might provide an additional or alternative explanation for why the pdf-GAL4–driven knockdown of Itpr affected neither calcium rhythms nor behavior. We also note that the literature provides examples, wherein a single RNAi line produces stronger behavioral effects when coupled with pdf-Gal4 than with tim-GAL4 . Such findings suggest that the final result in such experiments will represent a mixture of GAL4 driver line strength and the differential contributions of the UAS:Responder gene product across different positions within an affected neural circuit."
"Finally, the RNAi knockdown of the plasma membrane calcium channel α1T indicated a role for voltage-gated T-type calcium channels in the final rhythmic output of the pacemakers. Consistent with a role in the presumed output pathway, impairing the rhythm of fast calcium activity strongly affected circadian behavior but did not affect the molecular clock  or the slow calcium rhythms. T-type channels play a crucial role in other pacemakers, such as the Sino-Atrial node of the mammalian heart ."
"Their conduction in the hyperpolarized state and closure at more depolarized potentials are central to their role in generating bursting dynamics with periods much longer than the membrane time constant . Given the power spectrum of the fluctuations we observed, it seems possible that α1T channels play a similar role in the fast  fluctuations of Drosophila circadian neurons. Remarkably, the expression of α1T also displays a circadian rhythm, with distinct phases in different groups of pacemaker neurons  ."
"Collectively, these results suggest that Itpr and α1T channel activity are together critical to produce clock regulation of rhythms in both slow and fast calcium activities of key pacemaker neurons. Materials and Methods Fly Stocks. Flies were reared on standard yeast-supplemented cornmeal/agar food at room temperature."

"Flies were first anesthetized by CO2 and immobilized by inserting the neck into a narrow cut in an aluminum foil base. A portion of the dorsoanterior cuticle on one side of the head, an antenna, and a small part of one compound eye were then removed. For slow calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom horizontalscanning Objective Coupled Planar Illumination microscope ."
"The scanning was done by moving the stage horizontally every 10 min for 24 h. Each scan contained 20 to 40 separate frames with a step size of 5 to 10 μm. For fast calcium rhythm measurements, imaging was conducted with a custom high-speed OCPI- 2 microscope ."
"Each scanning session involved moving the objective using a piezo motor at 1 to 5 Hz for 1 to 2 min. The same scans were then repeated on the same specimens every hour for 24 h. During both slow and fast imaging modes, fresh haemolymph-like solution  was continuously perfused ."
"Locomotor Activity Rhythm. The Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor system was used to monitor the locomotor activity rhythms of individual flies; 4- to 6-d-old male flies were monitored for 6 d under LD cycles and then, for 9 d under DD conditions. The circadian rhythmicity and periodicity were measured by χ2 periodograms with a 95% confidence cutoff and SNR analysis ."
"Arrhythmicity was defined by a power value  less than 10, a width lower than one, and a period less than 18 h or more than 30 h. Immunocytochemistry. The flies were entrained for 6 d under LD and dissected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18."
"After dissection in ice-cold, calcium-free saline, fly brains were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 7%  picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PER [1:5,000; provided by M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA ]."
Secondary antisera were Cy3-conjugated . Images were taken on the Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. PER protein immunostaining intensity was measured in ImageJ-based Fiji .
"Imaging Data Analysis. Calcium imaging data were acquired by custom software, Imagine , and preprocessed using custom scripts in Julia 0. 6 to produce nonrigid registration, alignment, and maximal projection along the z axis."
The images were then visualized and analyzed in ImageJ-based Fiji by manually selecting ROIs over individual cells or groups of cells and measuring the intensity of ROIs over time. Slow calcium activity was analyzed as described previously . Fast calcium activity in each scanning session was analyzed similarly.
"Between sequential scanning sessions, the ROIs for individual neurons were manually corrected for position drifts. For the calcium signal of each ROI in each session, the mean of calcium intensity  was measured. The range of calcium transients  was measured by the average maximal calcium intensity at each time point and by the average minimal calcium intensity at each time point."
"The power spectrum  was generated by fast Fourier transform. Then, the calcium signal was filtered by a high-pass filter , and the SD of calcium changes was measured. Calcium activity trace analysis and statistics were performed using R 3."
3. 3 and Prism 8 . Network theory has been applied to connectomes at multiple scales to understand brain-wide organization6–12.
"Such analyses quantify the interconnectivity and robustness of a network13 and can identify highly connected nodes that may act as hubs14. They also serve as a basis for comparison across brain regions, individuals, developmental stages or species, enabling researchers to identify commonalities and differences in brain organization. Mesoscale connectomes have been constructed for the brains of humans and other mammals from MRI and MEG data6,15,16, relying on functional activity correlations to infer connectivity at the millimetre scale."
"Rich-club organization has been observed in several mesoscale connectomes: in humans, other mammals8,9,17 and light-level  connectomes in Drosophila18,19. Rich-club organization has been proposed to contribute to the ability of brains to efficiently integrate and disseminate information. Advancements in electron microscopy and dense volumetric reconstruction have enabled researchers to examine increasingly larger brain networks at the microscale."
"These methods do not make assumptions about the relationship between neuron connectivity and functional correlations; nodes and edges can be directly related to neurons and synaptic connections. For example, rich-club neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are part of well-studied motor control circuits7,20,21. Patterns of neuronal connectivity that reoccur in different brain areas, known as motifs, have been proposed as ‘building blocks’ of networks22,23, and their prevalence in neural networks has been studied to identify organizational principles7,10–12,24–26."
"Motifs such as reciprocal connections7,11,12,21,27, feedforward loops7,24,25 and 3-unicycles12 have received considerable attention in neuroscience owing to their implications for local computation and information flow. In this study, we characterize the network properties of the wholebrain, synapse-resolution connectome generated by the Flywire Consortium3,5, the first complete wiring diagram of an adult brain, that of a female Drosophila melanogaster1, and we lay the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical studies in this model system. A summary of data products can be found in Table 1."
"Summary of the dataset and definitions Here we analyse the v630 snapshot of the Drosophila connectome as a directed weighted graph . Synapses were detected automatically28 and, for each α→β neuron pair, the total number of synapses between two neurons defines the connection weight . Consistent with the flagship connectome paper3, we applied a threshold of five synapses per connection, unless otherwise noted ; however, we also examined the robustness of several results to variation in the synapse threshold ."
"This gives us a graph with 127,978 neurons and 2,613,129 connections3 . The connectome also contains synapse-level neurotransmitter predictions4. The classifier discriminates between six neurotransmitters: the fast-acting classical neurotransmitters acetylcholine , GABA and glutamate , and the monoamines dopamine , octopamine  and serotonin ."
"In Drosophila, ach is excitatory and GABA is inhibitory. Glutamate can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within the brain of the fly, it has largely been observed to be inhibitory29,30. The distribution of degrees reflects the amount of connectivity between neurons."
"A neuron’s in-degree is defined as the number of presynaptic partners, and the out-degree is defined as the number of postsynaptic partners. The average in/out-degree of an intrinsic neuron in the brain is 20. 5 , but in-degree and out-degree are not highly correlated ."
"The average connection consists of 12. 6 synapses3, and the connection probability is 0. 000161."
"This makes the fly brain a very sparse matrix when compared with the C. elegans nervous system or the partial wiring diagrams of larval zebrafish and mouse, with or without a threshold applied . This sparsity is due in part to the size of the fly brain."
"The connection probability is highest among neurons with nearby arbours. Only 3% of neuron pairs have arbours within 50 μm of each other, but such pairs make 71% of all connections . However, even in this close regime, the connection probability  in the fly is lower than in other wiring diagrams."
"Neurons form one connected component To assess interconnectivity, we searched for strongly  and weakly  connected components . Despite its sparsity, the brain forms a highly connected network—93. 3% of neurons are contained in a single SCC, while 98."
"8% of neurons are contained in a single WCC . These giant connected components, which contain the majority of neurons, persist when either the strongest or weakest connections are pruned  and are robust to threshold choice , indicating that connectivity is robust: many paths connect neuron pairs. Within the giant SCC, the average shortest directed path length between neuron pairs is 4."
"42 hops, with every neuron reachable within 13 hops . In the giant WCC, the average shortest undirected path length between neuron pairs is 3. 91 hops, with every neuron reachable within 11 hops ."
"These numbers are comparable to those found in a similar analysis of the hemibrain dataset31. The short path lengths show that the fly brain is relatively shallow compared with artificial networks. The similarities in size and path length distribution between the giant SCC and WCC highlight the prevalence of recurrent connections in the brain: in a mostly feedforward network, one would expect a smaller first SCC with longer path lengths."
"To assess whether high interconnectivity is a consequence of a relatively large number of interconnected neurons, or a small number of very highly connected neurons, we constructed survival curves, observing whether large connected components persist when neurons are removed. Removing neurons from the directed network, starting with those of largest total degree, we find that the first SCC persists until a total degree of 50, at which point the network splits into two SCCs of roughly equal size . These two SCCs correspond to the left and right hemispheres, and do not split into separate networks until about 60% of neurons are removed."
Removing neurons from the network by smallest total degree does not result in division of the first SCC . These results highlight the brain’s robust interconnectivity—it is not dependent on a small population of neurons. We observed similar behaviour in the undirected network .
"These results remain qualitatively consistent when neurons are removed by in-degree or out-degree alone . Spectral analysis of the brain To better understand the brain’s topology, we performed a spectral analysis of a random walk in the giant SCC , which converges to a stationary distribution over all neurons in which 3% of neurons were visited 61. 2% of the time ."
"These top-visited neurons are classified as attractor nodes. These attractors often make connections in the gnathal ganglia , a large midline neuropil that sends and receives information from the periphery and contains many connections to the ventral nerve cord . We also performed a reverse walk within the giant SCC, which converges to a stationary distribution in which 3% of neurons were visited 42."
"4% of the time . These neurons are repeller nodes, and include many with synapses in the antennal lobes  and medullae , brain regions that are close to the olfactory and visual periphery, respectively. The fly brain has a large rich club Many networks exhibit the rich-club property8,14,20, in which wellconnected nodes are preferentially connected to other well-connected nodes ."
"Comparing the observed network to a degreepreserving configuration  random model, there exists a rich-club regime in the fly brain, with a cut-off of total degree = 37 . This regime contains 40,218 neurons, approximately 30% of neurons in the brain . The connection probability within the rich club is 0."
"000870, 5. 4 times higher than the overall connection probability. The size of the rich club suggests that the network topology of the fly brain is fairly distributed, consistent with the connected component results."
"A rich-club analysis considering in-degree alone finds a rich-club regime with an in-degree threshold of 10, while no rich club is observed when considering out-degree alone . Note that, as we continue to remove nodes, we enter a regime  where the remaining neurons are no longer preferentially connected to each other . We further consider this very-high-degree regime in the Discussion."
"To examine the extent to which long-distance connections contribute to the rich-club property that we observe in the fly brain, we constructed an extension of the CFG model in which we constrain the random network by enforcing the measured connection probabilities between the 78 neuropils. By fixing the number of connections between and within neuropils, this neuropil connection  model implicitly contains mesoscale spatial information . We find that the observed network is not more highly connected than the NPC model , indicating that interneuropil connections contribute to the rich-club effect."
"The fraction of neurons in the rich-club regime in the fly is substantially larger than in C. elegans, which has a rich club of 11 neurons 20. Note that the differences in rich-club size are sensitive to the criteria used to determine the rich-club cut-off, and may also be a consequence of the different scales of these two networks."
"Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that, while the worm rich club contains known hub neurons, such as the command neurons AVA and AVB, such highly connected hub neurons do not seem to be present in the fly brain—although there are neurons with very high degrees, there also exist alternative paths between most neuron pairs. Recurrent motifs are over-represented Connection reciprocity is a measure of the amount of direct feedback in the brain. Across the brain, this connection reciprocity probability is 0."
"138 , higher than in both the Erdős–Rényi  and CFG random models . The over-representation of reciprocal connections in brains is well established, and our results are consistent with previous observations both in Drosophila31–33 and in other species7,11,21,24,25,34. The clustering coefficient, a metric that assesses the prevalence of triplet structures in the network, is 0."
"0477 in the fly brain , higher than in both the ER and CFG models. The high clustering coefficient demonstrates that the network is highly connected and is non-random in its structure. We present these metrics alongside those for two existing wholeanimal connectomes, the hermaphrodite and male C."
"elegans7,21,35, and two subvolume wiring diagrams, the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish12 and a region of L2/3 mouse visual cortex11 . Despite differences in the sparsity of the different brain networks, the values of reciprocity and clustering coefficient are comparable across all five datasets. The ER and CFG models do not contain any spatial information, instead assuming that any neuron pair may randomly connect."
"Our NPC model contains mesoscale spatial information but does not make distance comparisons for each neuron pair. We therefore constructed a neuron–neuron distance  model with two different spatial zones of connection probability, informed by the distribution of connections as a function of distance . We computed the reciprocity and clustering coefficient for both the NND and NPC models and found that the metrics for the real network were higher than in both spatial null models, suggesting that the nonrandom connectivity observed in the brain is not solely a consequence of spatial or morphological constraints."
"Direct comparisons of networks of different sizes should be interpreted with caution36–38. While the fly and worm datasets are complete brains, the zebrafish and mouse datasets are derived from brain subvolumes with truncated neurons. Moreover, differences in synapse detection and thresholding will impact topological metrics such as connection probability and reciprocity ."
Varying the synapse threshold in the fly did not substantially change these metrics . Small-worldness of the fly brain A small-world network is one in which nodes are highly clustered and path lengths are short13. High small-worldness coefficients are associated with efficient communication between nodes39.
"The small-worldness coefficient of the whole-brain fly connectome is SΔ = 141, higher than that of the C. elegans connectome  and close to that of the internet 13, implying highly effective global communication among neurons in the brain. Neurotransmitter makeup of reciprocal connections The average strength of edges participating in reciprocal connections is higher than the average strength of unidirectional connections ."
"The majority of unidirectional connections are cholinergic , while the edges participating in reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic neurons and more GABAergic neurons . Inhibitory connections in the brain have more synapses on average compared with excitatory connections3, which may partially explain the higher average strength of reciprocal connections. The most common reciprocal pairing is ach–GABA, and the second most common pairing is ach–glutamate ."
"Both of these reciprocal motifs are excitatory–inhibitory, and both are over-represented when compared to the neurotransmitter frequencies observed for reciprocal connections . By contrast, excitatory–excitatory ach–ach pairs are under-represented, as are inhibitory–inhibitory GABA–GABA pairs. We observed reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory  connection strengths to be only weakly correlated, whereas ach–ach pairs were uncorrelated ."
"Examples of reciprocal neuron pairs are shown in Fig. 2g. Reciprocal degree across the population Of the 127,978 neurons in the brain, 77,607 participate in at least one reciprocal connection: approximately 2 in every 3 neurons ."
"Many neurons participate in multiple reciprocal connections. We define reciprocal degree as the number of reciprocal connections made by a given neuron . Plotting the distributions of reciprocal degree by neurotransmitter, we observe that the majority of neurons with a high reciprocal degree  are GABAergic , while, at lower reciprocal degrees , all three primary neurotransmitter types are well represented."
"For most neurons, the fraction of reciprocal connections is low—on average 23% of incoming and 18% of outgoing connections are reciprocal. Plotting the fraction of reciprocal incoming connections against the fraction of reciprocal outgoing connections, we observed only a weak correlation , suggesting that the reciprocal degree is not strongly coupled to either in-degree or out-degree. Similarly, there is no relationship between the total degree and the reciprocal degree ."
"However, dividing the neuron population by neurotransmitter, we find that neurons of high total degree are mostly GABAergic and, for many of these neurons, more than half of their total connections are reciprocal . Neurotransmitter composition of three-node motifs The high clustering coefficient of the brain implies an overrepresentation of triplet structures. We determined the frequency at which each of the 12 directed three-node motifs occur in the brain ."
"Feedforward motifs  are under-represented when compared to both ER and CFG models, while all others, including the highly recurrent motifs , are over-represented. The strengths of edges participating in three-node motifs are higher than the average edge strength . Complex three-node motifs that contain reciprocal connections tend to be stronger than feedforward motifs."
"Examining the neurotransmitter composition of two of these motifs, feedforward loops  and 3-unicycles  , we found that edges that participate in feedforward loops were predominantly cholinergic, and that the most common neurotransmitter composition is three cholinergic neurons, a feedforward excitatory configuration . The next most common compositions contain either one or two inhibitory  edges. Feedforward loops with one inhibitory edge are probably feedforward inhibition motifs, whereas loops with two inhibitory edges are probably disinhibition motifs."
"By contrast, 3-unicycles contain a higher proportion of inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, and the three most common 3-unicycle compositions all contain at least one inhibitory neuron . These cycles may act as indirect feedback inhibition circuits. Notably, observed neurotransmitter composition frequencies are closer to what may be expected by chance for feedforward loops than for 3-unicycles."
"Examples of neurons that form three-node motifs are shown in Fig. 3f. A high clustering coefficient and an over-representation of highly connected motifs suggest that the local structure of the brain displays a high degree of non-randomness, consistent with previous studies in C."
"elegans7,21 and in the mouse cortex11,24,25. The over-representation of feedforward loops has been widely observed in other biological networks, such as in the rat cortex and C. elegans7,21,24,25."
"This over-representation is present in most neuropils in the brain. Large-scale connectivity in the brain Neurons with few inputs and many outputs may function as broadcasters of signals, while those with many inputs and few outputs may act as integrators. To examine such neurons, we divided the intrinsic rich-club neurons into three categories on the basis of their relative in-degree and out-degree , defining broadcasters as those for which out-degree ≥ 5 × in-degree and integrators as those for which in-degree ≥ 5 × out-degree."
"These definitions, while arbitrary, enable us to describe neuron populations with unbalanced in-/out-degrees. Given these definitions, we find 676 broadcasters and 638 integrators. The remaining intrinsic rich-club neurons , including most highly reciprocal neurons, fall into the balanced category."
"In comparison to the overall population, rich-club neurons are less likely to be cholinergic and more likely to be GABAergic . Integrators are even less likely to be cholinergic , and include a large fraction of dopaminergic neurons that may be engaged during learning. By contrast, broadcasters are predominantly cholinergic ."
"Central brain neurons are substantially over-represented in the rich club, while optic lobe intrinsic neurons are under-represented . Many integrators are either central-brain-intrinsic neurons or visual projection neurons, while few broadcasters are intrinsic to the central brain—many are visual centrifugal neurons or optic lobe intrinsic neurons. Broadcasters include a large number of Mi1 and Tm3 neurons—excitatory cells in the ME known to have key roles in the motion detection circuit32,40."
"Most neurons are restricted to a single hemisphere—11% have inputs in both hemispheres and 11% have outputs in both hemispheres3 . Rich-club neurons are more likely to have inputs or outputs spanning both hemispheres: 18% and 17%, respectively. This is more common for integrators  than for broadcasters ."
"Some examples of broadcasters, integrators and balanced neurons are shown in Fig. 4d. The rich club is close to sensory inputs To assess the distance of the rich-club neurons from sensory inputs, we used a probabilistic information flow model to determine the relative distance of each neuron from a set of seed neurons3,41 ."
"The model was run with different sets of seed neurons, each corresponding to a specific set of sensory inputs to the brain . This includes all sensory receptors projecting to the central brain as well as the population of visual projection neurons . Ranking these distances and normalizing returned the percentile rank of each neuron with respect to each modality."
"Neurons with percentile rank < 50% are closer than average to the given input, while neurons with percentile rank > 50% are farther. The rich-club neurons have a mean percentile rank of 44% relative to the set of all sensory inputs . Integrators have a mean percentile rank of 43%, while broadcasters have a mean percentile rank of 53%."
"The distribution of broadcasters is bifurcated, with one peak closer to inputs and another peak far from inputs. The second peak consists primarily of broadcasters in the optic lobe, which are far from sensory inputs to the central brain . Examining the ranks with respect to individual sensory modalities, we find that rich-club neurons are again closer than average to each modality ."
"Examining the distance of neurons to multiple sensory modalities, we find that broadcasters and integrators, while scattered throughout these distributions, tend to be closer than average to multiple sensory inputs . Integrators and broadcasters that are low in rank relative to multiple modalities may be candidate sites of multisensory integration and information propagation. Network differences across brain regions The Drosophila connectome has been segmented into 78 neuropils , each with different average connection strengths3."
"To understand information flow between neuropils, we used a fractional weighting method accounting for each neuron’s projections to and from every neuropil3 . We computed for each neuropil the relative fraction of internal, external incoming and external outgoing connection weights . These fractions reflect, respectively, the net number of connections within, being received and being sent from each neuropil."
"We find differences in these fractions across brain regions: the ellipsoid body  and fan-shaped body  of the central complex have the highest fraction of internal connections, while in other regions, such as the mushroom body , the majority of connections are external . Some regions, such as the lateral horn, send more connections than they receive, while others, such as the lobula plate, receive more connections than they send. The fraction of internal connection weights is not correlated with neuropil size: while large neuropils such as the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebra  have sizable fractions of internal weights, they do not rank the highest."
"Note that internal weights include any neurons with endings outside the brain, such as sensory, ascending and descending neurons, accounting for the high fraction of internal weights in regions such as the ME, which receive inputs from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and the GNG, which connects with large numbers of ascending and descending neurons. Across the brain, 52% of all connection weights can be classified as internal. Comparing the neurotransmitters of the neurons contributing connection weights, we see that internal connections are more likely than external ones to be inhibitory  ."
"We also see differences in the neurotransmitter composition across regions . Reciprocal connections in neuropils To perform motif analyses within each neuropil, we identified neuropil subnetworks that treat all connections within a neuropil as edges . Different neuropils differ in connection strength and density ."
"Computing the reciprocity in each neuropil , we found regions with high reciprocity probabilities, including the central complex ) and the ALs. The relative number of reciprocal connections is high in the MB and ME . Note that, for these motif analyses, the results for small neuropils such as the cantles, bulbs, galls, accessory ME and ocellar ganglion are less interpretable owing to the small number of neurons."
"In most neuropils, as in the whole brain, reciprocal connections are stronger than unidirectional connections . Exceptions include the protocerebral bridge, MB calyces and bulbs, which have stronger unidirectional than reciprocal connections. There are differences in the relative prevalence of each neurotransmitter in reciprocal and unidirectional connections across neuropils : while, in most neuropils, reciprocal connections contain fewer cholinergic and more GABAergic edges, there are notable exceptions, such as in the neuropils of the central complex ."
"In the MB, we find especially large differences in the neurotransmitter composition between unidirectional and reciprocal connections. Comparing the edge strengths of reciprocal excitatory–inhibitory  connections within neuropil subnetworks, we observe that excitatory–inhibitory connection strengths are more strongly correlated in some neuropils  than in others . These correlations do not appear to be dependent on neuropil size ."
"Identifying NSRNs We searched for intrinsic highly reciprocal rich-club neurons that make the majority of their connections within a single neuropil, and found 1,863 neurons that meet these criteria . These neuropil-specific highly reciprocal neurons  are predominantly inhibitory: 54% are GABAergic and another 10% are glutamatergic . In some neuropils, such as the AL and EB, there are many NSRNs, while in other neuropils, there exist only a handful of such neurons."
"Some NSRNs, like the APL neurons in the MB42, CT1 neurons in the lobula 43 or AL local neurons 44, are known to provide global feedback inhibition in these regions. These neurons tend to be highly branched, with individual processes making reciprocal connections with different feedforward neurons. Some have been shown to have compartmentalized activity, raising the possibility of local computation45,46."
"NSRNs that have yet to be characterized may have similar roles in other circuits—for example, it is likely that NSRNs found in the AVLP provide feedback to the auditory circuits in this region47. Interneuropil reciprocal connections While many reciprocal connections occur within single neuropils, 12. 1% of all reciprocal pairs are formed by connections in two neuropils ."
"Mapping these reciprocal connections, we find off-diagonal terms that represent pairs connecting across neuropils . The compartments of the MB are linked by many reciprocal connections, while the neuropils of the suboesophageal zone, including the GNG, saddle  and prow , form a connected block. Strong reciprocal connectivity also occurs across the midline, such as between the left and right ALs."
"Neuropils close to the midline, such as superior medial protocerebrum , superior posterior slope  and inferior posterior slope , tend to have many cross-hemispheric reciprocal connections. There also exist reciprocal connections that span the central brain, such as those between the left and right anterior optic tubercles  or the left and right lateral accessory lobes , demonstrating that recurrent motifs are not limited to local connections— they also exist at large spatial scales. Examples of such pairs are shown in Extended Data Fig."
"7e. We also compared the map of reciprocal connections to the projectome map of all connections . For example, the superior lateral protocerebrum  and superior intermediate protocerebrum  are connected to the FB in the projectome but have no reciprocal connections."
"Similarly, the laminae has many internal connections but few reciprocal ones. Examining ach–GABA reciprocal connections highlights deviations from symmetry that represent a net imbalance of excitatory–inhibitory reciprocal connections . For example, between the LO and PVLP, most ach–GABA reciprocal connections share directionality: the ach connections are in the LO and the GABA connections are in the PVLP."
"Three-node motifs differ across regions We computed the prevalence of three-node motifs in each neuropil subnetwork relative to ER and CFG null models . Across most neuropils, we observed the same trend as we do across the entire brain: an under-representation of feedforward motifs  and an over-representation of complex motifs . However, there are notable differences between neuropils."
"In the cantles, epaulettes and gorgets, for example, the frequency of three-node motifs was closer to that expected in a CFG null model, while, in the FB and EB, complex motifs are particularly over-represented, consistent with their high reciprocity . Feedforward loops  are over-represented in most neuropils, except for the FB, EB, NO and MB compartments. This suggests a relative under-representation of both feedforward excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits in these brain regions."
"3-unicycles , an indirect feedback inhibition circuit, are over-represented across the entire brain  but are under-represented in most neuropils. The notable exceptions, the ME and GNG, are very large neuropils with many sensory inputs. The over-representation of 3-unicycles in the ME implies the existence of localized cyclic structures in early visual circuitry."
"Notably, this motif is also over-represented in the zebrafish oculomotor circuit12. Motifs 7–10 are under-represented in the ALs, perhaps a result of the small number of unidirectional edges in these regions. In most neuropils, we find that edges participating in underrepresented motifs are weaker on average than edges participating in over-represented motifs , and that edges participating in three-node motifs are stronger than average ."
"This is broadly consistent with the whole-brain three-node motif strength results. A notable exception is the laminae, where feedforward connections are strong despite being under-represented. Discussion The completion of a wiring diagram of the full brain of D."
"melanogaster enabled us to characterize its network properties, laying the groundwork for connecting circuit motifs to biological function. Our analysis leverages spatial information, neuron class distinctions , cell type labels  and neurotransmitter predictions to interpret the network features we uncovered. Despite its sparsity, the fly brain is a robust and highly interconnected network, with over-represented reciprocal and recurrent motifs spanning multiple brain regions."
"These long-range connections may explain results from recent brain-wide neural recording experiments in fly48–50 and other species51–53 that have uncovered widespread activity related to both sensory processing and behaviour . We provide searchable and filterable lists of the neurons discussed in this study, as well as a motif search and visualization tool to facilitate hypothesis generation and model development online through Codex . Limitations The availability of neurotransmitter predictions4, for at least ach, GABA, glut, da, ser and oct, greatly enhanced our ability to interpret the circuit motifs we identified in the connectome."
"However, although neurotransmitter predictions are 94% accurate when compared to a set of ground truth neurons, there are cases in which the predicted neurotransmitter does not align with the known transmitter. Here we manually corrected the Kenyon cells to be cholinergic . There may exist other populations that are also systematically misidentified, but which currently lack ground truth neurotransmitter information."
"While we assume that neurons obey Dale’s law , there are several known examples of co-transmission in Drosophila54. It remains unclear how widespread neurotransmitter co-transmission is. Note also that the synaptic connectome does not provide a complete picture of information flow in the brain."
"We do not currently have a map of gap junction synapses in the fly or of the extent of neuropeptide signalling55. Some analyses, particularly those dependent on network topology, are sensitive to our choice of synapse threshold. While connectomes in C."
"elegans have been proofread to the level of individual synapses21,27,35, this is not feasible in larger datasets2,3,31. We therefore rely on automated synapse detection algorithms with a non-negligible error rate28. Not all synapses are successfully attached to neurons, and this completion rate varies across brain regions3."
"Although some of these low-synapse-number connections may be spurious, it is likely that some weak connections persist across individuals, as has been found in C. elegans27. Our companion paper on the fly optic lobe has found that a lower synapse threshold is important for correct cell type identification in those brain regions, further suggesting the importance of some low-synapse connections56."
"Here we applied a consistent and conservative threshold of five synapses per connection between neurons , and we demonstrated that our interpretations of connected components, sparsity, reciprocity and clustering coefficients are not dependent on this threshold. It is likely that the fly brain is more strongly interconnected than the results here indicate. Local circuit motifs are often inferred to be feedforward or feedback connections."
"However, it is difficult to place local circuits in the context of global directionality from sensory input to motor output. In shallow networks, the directionality of the wiring diagram is clear. However, the larger the network becomes, the more difficult it becomes to establish directionality."
"In this study, we used an information flow method to rank neurons relative to various sensory modalities3. Ultimately, directionality of information flow in particular circuits, especially those in regions of the brain far from sensory inputs or motor outputs, must be determined experimentally. Neuropil-specific differences Different neuropils in Drosophila are known to have different functions."
"Studying network topology at the brain scale enables us to highlight how these functional differences are subserved by network differences. For example, the MBs are known to be a centre for learning and memory in the fly brain32. We find in the MB compartments the largest fraction of dopaminergic connections , the biggest differences between reciprocal and unidirectional neurotransmitter percentages , and a three-node motif distribution close to that of null models ."
"This combination of network characteristics is unique across the neuropils of the brain. Another well studied neuropil, the EB, is known to be involved in navigation, supporting persistent activity correlated to heading direction57–59. We observed that the EB has one of the highest reciprocity rates , one of the highest average connection strengths  and very large over-representations of highly recurrent three-node motifs ."
"This represents a unique combination of neuropil-scale network properties. By contrast, while the GNG has a similar three-node motif profile , it has much lower The rich club and anatomical bottlenecks The anatomy of the fly brain suggests two potential bottlenecks: one between left hemisphere and right hemisphere and one between the central brain and optic lobes. Only 12% of neurons cross hemispheres and 6% of neurons cross between the central brain and optic lobes3,5."
"Despite these bottlenecks, the brain is still robustly interconnected with short path lengths. The large rich-club regime in the fly brain may explain these short path lengths. When compared to the average neuron in the brain, rich-club neurons are more likely to contain synapses in both hemispheres, and are also more likely to connect the optic lobes to the central brain."
"The broad spatial reach of these rich-club neurons also keeps path lengths short across these bottlenecks. In the human brain, it has been proposed that rich-club hubs in functional connectomes help keep path lengths short. In the fly brain, we see that the rich-club neuron population indeed contributes to short path lengths."
"Future functional experiments in the fly focusing on the rich-club population may shed light on whether this is the case at the neuron scale. We also expect that the ascending and descending neurons, which form a bottleneck between the brain and the VNC, will be part of the central nervous system rich club. Many ascending and descending neurons appear to have high degrees when examined within either the brain or the VNC60."
"We await the completion of a complete CNS connectome to verify the rich-club membership of such neurons. The very-high-degree regime Our rich-club analysis showed that we enter a rich-club regime above total degree 37. However, as we continue to remove neurons, we find that the population of neurons above degree ~100 are no longer preferentially connected relative to either CFG or NPC random networks ."
"On the basis of the SCC and WCC survival curves , these very-high-degree neurons do not form multiple islands of connectivity. Rather, the first connected component persists until nearly all neurons are removed, and the second connected component never approaches the size of the first. The under-representation of connections between the very highest degree neurons is correlated with neurotransmitter composition—most are GABAergic ."
"These very large GABAergic neurons are less likely than chance to form connections with each other. Comparing connectomes across animals Comparing network properties across different species has the potential to uncover conserved and divergent properties of brain organization. Similarities in reciprocity and clustering coefficient across animals, which vary substantially in both size and connection density , hint at the possibility that some features of circuit architecture may be broadly conserved across nervous systems ."
"However, comparisons of graph metrics across networks of different sizes, even for neuron-normalized metrics such as reciprocity and clustering coefficient, must be made with care36–38. Moreover, as mentioned previously, differences in proofreading and thresholding will impact topological metrics, which treat all edges as equivalent. Applying the same threshold across datasets does not resolve this, as a given number of synapses may have different biological implications across species."
"It has also been observed, both in this work and in past studies, that different parts of the brain of the fly differ in their connectivity properties31,33. It is likely that the same is true in larger brains, meaning that statistics derived from partial wiring diagrams may not be representative. In C."
"elegans, there is substantial variability in the connectomes of genetically identical individuals27. Comparisons between the FlyWire and hemibrain datasets have already revealed similarities and differences between individual flies, as outlined in our companion paper5, but more datasets will be needed before we fully understand the variability between individuals in Drosophila. Fortunately, more whole-brain connectomes are on the horizon."
"The network analysis of the fly brain presented should serve as a valuable baseline for comparison, both to the connectomes of other Drosophila individuals and to the connectomes of other species, to identify which network features are common and which are species- or individual-specific. A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ‘parts list’ of the brain1, and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function2,3. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision4,5."
"Here we analyse the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families 6–10 at least double in number of types."
"A new serpentine medulla  interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of crossneuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analysing the distances in high-dimensional feature space, and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features."
"We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object and colour vision. Connectivity with ‘boundary types’ that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development."
"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the twentieth century concern the neural basis of sensory perception. Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery of simple and complex cells in the visual cortex not only entered neuroscience textbooks, but the hypothetical neuronal wiring diagrams in their 1962 paper11 also inspired convolutional nets12,13, which eventually ignited the deep-learning revolution in artificial intelligence14. It may come as a surprise that directly mapping such wiring diagrams, influential as they may be, has been highly challenging or even impossible in mammalian brains."
"Progress is being made by visual physiologists15–17, and the reconstruction of a column of visual cortex from electron microscopy images is also becoming feasible18,19. These are tiny slivers of visual systems; scaling up to the full complexity of mammalian vision is still aspirational. To imagine the future of visual neuroscience, it is helpful to extrapolate from a brain of a more modest size—that of the fly."
"Especially over the past 15 years, visual neural circuits have been intensively investigated in Drosophila4 with great progress in understanding the perception of motion5,10, colour20 and objects21, as well as the role of vision in complex behaviours like courtship22. The release of a neuronal wiring diagram of a Drosophila brain23–25 poses an unprecedented opportunity. The first wiring diagram for a whole brain contains as a corollary the first wiring diagram for an entire visual system, as well as all the wiring connecting the visual system with the rest of the brain."
"About 38,500 neurons are intrinsic to the right optic lobe of the reconstructed Drosophila brain . The full wiring diagram for these neurons is too complex to comprehend or even visualize. It is essential to reduce complexity by describing the connectivity between types of cells."
"For example, the roughly 800 ommatidia in the compound eye send photoreceptor axons to roughly 800 L1 cells in the lamina, which in turn connect with around 800 Mi1 cells. That is a lot of cells and connections, but they can all be described by the simple rules that photoreceptors connect to L1, and L1 connects to Mi1. Some such rules are known7,26–30, but this knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete."
"Here we exhaustively enumerate all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, and find all rules of connection between them. We effectively collapse 38,500 intrinsic neurons onto just 227 types, a reduction of more than 150×. The wiring diagram is reduced from a 38,500 × 38,500 matrix to a 227 × 227 matrix, an even greater compression."
"We additionally provide rules of connectivity between intrinsic types and 500 types of boundary neurons , which have also been annotated25. In our connectomic approach, a cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar patterns of connectivity9, and such cells are expected to share the same function2. By the same logic, cell types with similar patterns of connectivity should have similar functions."
"This logic will be used to generate hypotheses about the functions of newly discovered cell types, as well as the previously known cell types for which functional information has been lacking. Class, family and type Neurons intrinsic to the optic lobe are those with almost all of their synapses inside the optic lobe , and are the main topic of this study . Moreover, there are boundary neurons that straddle the optic lobe and the rest of the brain ."
"Boundary neurons fall into several classes: visual projection neurons  project from the optic lobe to the central brain, visual centrifugal neurons  do the opposite and heterolateral neurons extend from one optic lobe to the other while making few or no synapses in the central brain. Targets of boundary neurons in the central brain are generally multimodal and/or sensorimotor24, mixing information coming from the eyes and other sense organs, so we regard the optic lobe proper as the fly’s visual system. The brain of a single Drosophila adult female was reconstructed by the FlyWire Consortium24,31."
"We proofread around 38,500 intrinsic neurons in the right optic lobe , as well as 3,900 VPNs, 250 VCNs, 150 heterolateral neurons and 4,700 photoreceptor cells . In total, 77% of the synapses of intrinsic neurons are with other intrinsic neurons, and 23% are with boundary neurons. We divide optic lobe intrinsic neurons into four broad classes: columnar, local interneuron, cross-neuropil tangential and cross-neuropil amacrine ."
"Cells of the columnar class  have axons oriented parallel to the main axis of the visual columns . Following a previous study6, the arbour of a columnar neuron is allowed to be wider than a single column; what matters is the orientation of the axon, not the aspect ratio of the arbour. Photoreceptor cells are columnar but are not intrinsic to the optic lobe, strictly speaking, because they enter from the retina."
"Nevertheless, they will sometimes be included with intrinsic types in the following analyses. The optic lobe  contains four main neuropils  and a smaller fifth neuropil— the accessory medulla . We further distinguish between distal and proximal medulla, regarding them as two separate neuropils6 ."
"The border between them is layer 7 of the medulla , which is also known as the serpentine layer6,32. A columnar cell spans multiple neuropils . Cells of the local interneuron class  are defined as being confined to a single neuropil."
We also define two classes that cross multiple neuropils but are not columnar. A cross-neuropil tangential cell  has an axon that is oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the visual columns as it runs inside a neuropil. A cross-neuropil amacrine cell  lacks an axon.
"Interneurons are typically amacrine, but sometimes have an axon in the tangential orientation. Each class is divided into families. A family is defined as a set of cells that share the same neuropils ."
"For example, the Tm family projects from the distal medulla to the lobula, while the TmY family projects from the distal medulla to both the lobula and lobula plate . Each family is divided into cell types. All 227 intrinsic types as well as photoreceptor types are available for 3D interactive viewing at the Fly- Wire Codex ."
"Supplementary Data 1 includes a list of all intrinsic types and their properties. Supplementary Data 2 contains one ‘card’ for each type, which includes its discriminative logical predicate , basic statistics, diagram showing stratification and other single-cell anatomy, and 3D renderings of all the cells in the type. Most neurons in the optic lobe are columnar ), and half of the families are columnar )."
"Interneurons constitute just 17% of optic lobe intrinsic neurons, but the majority of cell types ). A columnar family  contains more cells than any other family ). An interneuron family  contains more types than any other family )."
"The columnar families  are well known6. The Sm interneuron family is new , and its name is inspired by its stratification in the serpentine medulla . Some of the cross-neuropil families are wholly or almost wholly new ."
"Over half of the cell types are new, and many of these are interneuron types. Connectomic approach to cell types For each cell, we define an output feature vector by the number of output synapses onto neurons of cell type t, which runs from 1 to T. The output feature vector is a row of the cell-to-type connectivity matrix ."
"For each cell, we similarly define an input feature vector by the number of input synapses received from neurons of cell type t. This is a column of the type-to-cell connectivity matrix . The input and output feature vectors are concatenated to form a 2T-dimensional feature vector ."
"The feature dimensions include only intrinsic types, so T is 227. A cell type is defined as a set of cells with similar feature vectors9. Cells of the same type are near each other in feature space, while cells of different types are far away ."
This was quantified using the weighted Jaccard distance . Our definition of feature vectors requires that some cell types should already exist. An initial set of cell types was defined by human analysts using traditional morphological criteria .
"These traditional cell types were used to compute feature vectors, and hierarchical clustering was applied. In many cases, this led to further division into cell types that could not be distinguished by traditional criteria. In other cases, it led to grouping of morphological variants into a single type."
"After splitting or merging types, the feature vectors were recomputed and the process was continued iteratively. The final cell types were validated in several ways . We show that our clustering is self-consistent, in the sense that almost all cells end up in the original cluster if we attempt to reassign each cell’s feature vector to the nearest cluster."
"For more interpretable evaluations, we construct compact connectivity-based discriminators that can predict cell type membership . We show that membership can be accurately predicted by a logical conjunction of on average five synaptic partner types. For each interneuron type, we also provide selected pairs of features that can be used to discriminate that type from others in the same neuropil ."
"Hierarchical clustering of cell types We defined a connectomic cell type as a set of cells with similar feature vectors based on connectivity. It follows that cells of the same type should share the same function, according to the maxim “Nothing defines the function of a neuron better than its connections”33. The same maxim also implies that cell types with similar feature vectors should have similar visual functions."
"A cell type feature vector can be obtained by summing the feature vectors over all cells in that type, followed by normalization . Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types . Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering , which will be interpreted later on."

"Computing the Jaccard distance between all pairs of cell type feature vectors and applying average linkage hierarchical clustering yields a dendrogram of cell types . Thresholding the dendrogram yields a flat clustering , which will be interpreted later on. connections."
"One that we have found to be helpful is to display the top input and output connections of each type . In such a graph, some nodes can have more than one outgoing and/or more than one incoming connection. A few of these nodes show up as ‘hubs’ with many visible connections."
"For example, Mi1 is the top input to a large number of postsynaptic types . The nodes of the graph were positioned in 2D space by a graph layout algorithm that tends to place strongly connected types close together . It turns out that nearby nodes in the 2D graph layout space tend to belong to the clusters that were extracted from the high-dimensional connectivity-based feature vectors ."
"We can also normalize the type-to-type connection matrix to be the fraction of synapses from cell type s to cell type t. Depending on the normalization, this could be the fraction of input to type t or fraction of output from type s . Input and output fractions are shown in Supplementary Data 5, and are equivalent to the cell type feature vectors defined earlier."
"The heat maps of Supplementary Data 5 are important because they show a much more complete set of connections than the wiring diagrams, which are highly selective visualizations. Perplexity as a measure of degree of connectivity The degree of a cell type can be defined as the number of cell types to which it is connected. Weak connections can be excluded from this definition by thresholding the type-to-type connection matrix before computing degree."
"For a threshold-independent measure, we instead calculate a ‘perplexity’34 for each cell type. The outgoing connection strengths  are normalized as if they were a probability distribution, and out-perplexity is defined as the exponential of the entropy of this distribution. Out-perplexity reduces to out-degree in the special case that the distribution is uniform over the connected partners."
"In-perplexity is defined analogously. If intrinsic cell types are ranked by the product of out- and in-perplexity , then TmY5a is the most connected hub, and various types in the lamina and distal medulla are the least hub-like. Motion-related cell types generally do not have high perplexity."
"Out-perplexity tends to be greater than in-perplexity , although they are positively correlated . One might expect that ‘early’ types in visual processing would have divergent connectivity, to distribute photoreceptor signals to many targets, while ‘late’ types would have convergent connectivity, summarizing the final results of optic lobe computations for use by the central brain. This idea can be tested by ranking types according to the ratio of out-perplexity to in-perplexity ."
"Indeed, the top of the list includes early types like the inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, L3 and L5, and many Dm and Pm interneuron types, and many Sm types are near the bottom of the list; they can be interpreted as ‘late’ types given their extensive connectivity with VPNs. The ‘numerous’ cell types Photoreceptor axons project retinotopically from the eye to the lamina  and distal medulla . The medulla is divided into columns, which are presumed to be in one-to-one correspondence with ommatidia of the compound eye."
"Cell types containing >720 cells in our reconstruction , as well as photoreceptor types, will be called ‘numerous’. The top end  of this range is probably the true number of columns in this optic lobe. For each numerous type, the cells appear to be distributed one per column , and the true number of cells is expected to approximate 800."
"The observed cell numbers are mostly smaller than 800; some cells are missing from columns, presumably due to under-recovery of cells by proofreading . The connections between numerous types agree well with a previous reconstruction of seven medulla columns27 . The 28 numerous types have long been known6."
"At the other extreme, 16 types contain only a single cell. Most types  lie between the extremes . It is the less numerous types of which our knowledge has been incomplete, and arguably they are where much of the magic of vision happens."
"As with the photoreceptors, neural activity in the numerous cell types like L1 and Mi1 mostly encodes information about the image at or near single points in visual space. But perception requires the integration of information from points that can be quite distant from each other, and this is done by the larger neurons that belong to the less numerous types. For most of the numerous types, visual responses have been observed previously4, and will be used to interpret the dendrogram of Fig."
"2c. We will see that the numerous types that belong to a single cluster have similar functions, which enables us to ascribe a function to each cluster as a whole. In other words, we extrapolate from the functions of the numerous types to yield preliminary clues regarding the functions of the less-numerous types."
"These extrapolations are speculative, and are merely starting points for hypothesis generation and experimental research, and the clusters are not set in stone. They were obtained by thresholding a hierarchical clustering , and adjusting this threshold will change the number of clusters . Rather than use our clusterings, some readers may prefer to directly consult the weighted Jaccard distances between types , from which the clusterings were derived."
"Other cautionary notes about the clusters are given in the Methods and Discussion. These caveats notwithstanding, we next proceed to functional interpretation of the clusters in Fig. 2c."
"ON, OFF and luminance channels Cluster 10 and cluster 11  both receive strong input from photoreceptors R1–6 , and we propose that they are regarded as OFF and ON channels, respectively, carrying information about light decrements  and light increments . Our concept is similar to the well-known ON and OFF motion pathways35,36, but differs because our ON and OFF channels are general purpose, feeding into the object and colour subsystems as well as the motion subsystem. Cluster 10 contains the OFF cells L2, L4, Tm1, Tm2 and Tm4."
"Cluster 11 contains the ON cells L5, Mi1 and Tm3, and also the OFF cell L1. It makes sense to assign L1 to the ON channel even though it is an OFF cell, because L1 is inhibitory/glutamatergic, so its effects on downstream partners are similar to those of an ON excitatory cell. Note that information about whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory was not used by our clustering algorithm."
"Cluster 11 also contains C2 and C3, which are expected to be ON cells because their top inputs are L1 and L5. A companion paper argues that the various Dm interneuron types in cluster 10 and cluster 11 normalize the activities of numerous types in the OFF and ON channels37. The ON and OFF motion pathways were traditionally defined by working backwards from the T4 and T5 motion detectors, which respectively compute the directions of moving ON and OFF stimuli4,5."
"The ON motion pathway is directly upstream from T4 and includes Mi1, Mi4, Mi9 and Tm3. The OFF motion pathway is directly upstream from T5 and includes Tm1, Tm2, Tm4 and Tm9. Figure 4 shows that these cell types have other strong targets besides T4/T5, so they do not seem to be solely or chiefly dedicated to motion ."
"L3 connectivity is sufficiently unique that it stands apart from all of the other cell types as a cluster containing only the single type L3 . This is consistent with current thinking that L3 constitutes a separate luminance channel, distinct from ON and OFF channels38. L3 is the only L type with a sustained rather than transient response39, and it encodes luminance rather than contrast40."
"Cluster 7 includes Dm4, Dm9, Dm12, Dm20 and Mi9, which all have L3 as their strongest input. Mi9 is also the strongest output of L3 and, like L3, exhibits a sustained response41. We therefore propose that cluster 7 should be lumped with L3 in a hypothetical luminance channel."
"Mi9 is traditionally grouped in the ON motion pathway, but Mi9 is an input to the object and colour subsystems, not only the motion subsystem. It is less obvious whether the remaining types in cluster 7  should be grouped in the luminance channel. Indeed, these types break off into a separate clusters when the threshold is adjusted to refine the flat clustering ."
"These types might alternatively be assigned to the colour subsystem as Mi15 and Dm2 are known to receive direct input from inner photoreceptor R842. Lawf2 is a cluster of its own. By targeting cell types  in cluster 11, Lawf2 provides centrifugal feedback to the ON channel ."
"However, the strongest output of Lawf2 is Lai , which is thought to mediate lateral inhibition in the lamina43 through pathways such as R1–6→Lai→R1–6 and R1–6→Lai→L326. Lawf2 may therefore modulate lateral interactions mediated by Lai. The strongest input to Lawf2 is OA-AL2b2, which could be octopaminergic or cholinergic44,45."
"If it is octopaminergic, this input could be the source of the previously reported octopaminergic gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons46. Lawf2 also receives strong input from cluster 9, which is hypothesized to be an object subsystem later on. Lai and Lawf1, the two types in cluster 8, have similar targets ."
"Cluster 8 provides centrifugal feedback to the OFF channel  and to R1–6 . Alternatively, cluster 8 could be interpreted as being part of the luminance channel, as cluster 7 is a strong input and L3 a strong output . Motion The motion-detecting T4 and T5 families belong to cluster 15 ."
"Cluster 16 contains CT1 and Tm9, which are well known to be important for motion computation4,5. It makes sense to regard Tm9 as dedicated to the motion subsystem rather than part of a general-purpose OFF channel, as 80% of its output synapses are onto CT1 or T5. Cluster 16 also includes Li14, an interneuron type with T5a as the strongest input, and T5a through T5d as the strongest outputs."
"T4/T5 neurons synapse onto VPNs that exit the optic lobe and enter the central brain . Cluster 13 and cluster 14 contain the lobula plate interneuron family, LPi1 through LPi156,8. Over half of these are new ."
"Some LPi types consist of one or two cells that cover the entire visual field . Two LPi types may stratify in the same lobula plate layers, but consist of cells with different sizes . Most LPi types are amacrine, but some exhibit axo-dendritic polarization ."
"Some types collectively cover only a portion of the visual field . All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 types, so it is clear that cluster 13 and cluster 14 are related to motion vision. All LPi types receive input from T4/T5 cells with a single preferred direction ."
"The only exception is LPi07, which receives inputs from T4/T5 cells with preferred directions c and d . LPi types synapse onto other LPi types and onto VPNs . Cluster 13 also contains columnar neurons from three Y types and all Tlp types."
"All of these are predicted to be glutamatergic, and are reciprocally connected with T4/T5 of particular preferred directions. The only exception is Tlp5, which receives input only from T4a/T5a. The Y and Tlp types also connect with LPi and columnar VPN types10."
"TmY20 and Am1 also belong to cluster 13, and were previously identified to be motion related10. Objects Cluster 9 includes the numerous types T2 and T3, which have been implicated in the detection of small objects47. Their downstream VPN partners LC1147 and LC1848  are also activated by small objects."
"On the basis of this information, we propose that cluster 9 is part of a hypothetical object subsystem . Cluster 9  includes many other types from columnar families , interneuron families  and cross-neuropil tangential and amacrine families . Downstream targets include LC, LPLC and LT types ."
"Mi1 and Tm1 are the most prominent inputs to the subsystem , and respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels defined above. They are top inputs to T3, explaining why T3 is ON–OFF47. T2 is ON–OFF because its top inputs are L5 and Tm2, which respectively belong to the ON and OFF channels."
"Note that the Tm1 input to T2 and the L5 input to T2 are second from the top, and therefore do not show up in Fig. 6, which is restricted to the top inputs and outputs. Several types are nearby T2 and T3 in the cell types dendrogram ."
"In particular, T2a, Tm21, Tm25, Tm27, TmY3 and Y3 are fairly numerous and excitatory, so we regard them as candidate object detectors. Despite its name, T2a is more similar to T3 in connectivity than to T2 . T2a also receives Mi1 and Tm1 input like T3, and is predicted to be ON–OFF."
"The top output of T2a is LC17, which is known to be activated by small objects49 and also receives input from T3. Cluster 12 contains Li19 and Li25 . Cluster 9 is both a strong input to cluster 12  and a strong output of cluster 12 , largely due to connections between Tm21 and Cluster12."
"We therefore include cluster 12 as well as cluster 9 in the object subsystem. Colour and polarization The inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 are important for Drosophila colour vision because their responses are more narrowly tuned to the wavelength of light than those of the outer photoreceptors R1–6. R7 prefers ultraviolet light, whereas R8 prefers blue or green light20."
"Cluster 4 contains Dm8a, Dm8b, Dm11 and DmDRA2, which are all inner photoreceptor targets42. Cluster 1 contains most of the remaining types so far implicated in colour vision. As originally defined by morphology6, Tm5 is a potential postsynaptic target of the inner photoreceptors because it stratifies in the distal medulla at the M7 border and also in the M3."
"These are the medulla layers containing the axon terminals of R7 and R87. We found that Tm5 consists of six cell types . Three of our connectomic Tm5 types correspond to canonical Tm5 types that were previously defined by morphology and Ort expression7,50."
"Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 input, while Tm5c receives R8 input. Moreover, we found three new types, Tm5d, Tm5e and Tm5f, that receive little or no photoreceptor input, although their stratifications are similar to those of the canonical Tm5 types . The correspondences between connectomic and morphologicalmolecular Tm5 types were established using morphological criteria ."
"However, the reader should be cautioned that there is considerable variability within a type, so reliably typing individual cells based on morphology alone is difficult or impossible. Connectivity is essential for reliable discriminations. Tm5a and Tm5b receive R7 and Dm8 input, as expected from previous reports42,50,51."
"Tm5c receives R8 input42,50, and also strong L3 input . While some synapses from Dm8 to Tm5c do exist50, this connection seems to be weak. Tm20 has been implicated in colour vision because it receives R8 input27,28,42."
"It also receives strong L3 input . Thus, Tm20 inputs are similar to Tm5c inputs, consistent with the physiological finding that these two types are more similar to each other in their chromatic responses than they are to Tm5a and Tm5b52. As Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c and Tm20 are known to be related to colour vision, we propose that the rest of cluster 1 is also part of a hypothetical colour subsystem ."
"The new Tm5 types  receive few or no synapses directly from photoreceptors, but Tm5d receives indirect R7 input from Tm5b and Dm8a, Tm5e receives indirect R8 input from Tm5c , and Tm5f receives indirect R8 input from Tm20 . Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic. We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively , and this preference is highly selective ."
"As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies 51,53 remains speculative . Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a and Tm8b , Tm16 and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37."
"The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula6. These types mainly stratify in serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in distal medulla . Nevertheless, we decided to lump them into the Tm family."
"Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few  cells, and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous  and predicted to be cholinergic . Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each, and are predicted to be cholinergic."
"Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm and Pm interneuron types, MLt types and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10. Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs."
"Mi4 has strong partners in the colour and object subsystems ). Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the colour subsystem. This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem."
"Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. Tm20 . Tm5d and Tm5e are predicted to be glutamatergic and Tm5f is predicted to be cholinergic."
"We have defined Dm8a and Dm8b, which synapse onto Tm5a and Tm5b, respectively , and this preference is highly selective . As with Tm5, splitting Dm8 is straightforward with connectivity but difficult or impossible with morphology. How our two Dm8 types correspond with the two types previously defined by molecular studies 51,53 remains speculative ."
"Cluster 1 also includes Tm7, Tm8a and Tm8b , Tm16 and wholly new types Tm31 to Tm37. The latter deviate from the classical definition of the Tm family, which is supposed to project from the distal medulla to the lobula6. These types mainly stratify in serpentine medulla and lobula, with little or no presence in distal medulla ."
"Nevertheless, we decided to lump them into the Tm family. Tm31 to Tm35 each contain relatively few  cells, and are predicted to not be cholinergic. This departs from the norm for existing Tm types, which are generally more numerous  and predicted to be cholinergic ."
"Tm36 and Tm37 contain more than 100 cells each, and are predicted to be cholinergic. Cluster 1 includes TmY types, Li, Sm and Pm interneuron types, MLt types and LLPt. Cluster 1 also includes Mi4 and Mi10."
"Mi4 was traditionally regarded as part of the ON motion pathway, but T4 cells are relatively weak outputs. Mi4 has strong partners in the colour and object subsystems ). Its strongest output is Mi9, which we have assigned to the luminance channel and is one of the major inputs to the colour subsystem."
"This diversity of targets shows that Mi4 is a major hub between multiple subsystems, although it has been assigned by the clustering to a single subsystem. Mi10 mediates a feedback loop L3→Mi9→Mi10→Lawf1→L3, so it might seem to belong to the luminance channel, but the clustering has placed it in cluster 1 because it is similar in connectivity to Mi4. in Tlp4 ."
"In the first stage of morphology-based classification, these errant cells were assigned to Y11. But such pseudo-Y11 cells were later reassigned to Tlp4 on the basis of connectivity. Their feature vectors match Tlp4 because their medullary projections make few synapses, and their connectivity in the lobula and lobula plate matches Tlp4."
"It is worth mentioning an unusual example in which ignoring morphological variation is correct in one sense, but ultimately turns out to be misleading. Three Li11 cells are annotated in the hemibrain reconstruction9, and three corresponding cells can be identified in our optic lobe25. We group two of these cells in one type ."
"The third cell can be paired with a fourth to form a pseudo-Li11 type with a small axonal projection into the central brain . Although the axon is visually striking, it has few synapses and therefore little impact on connectivity. Thus, it might be tempting to ignore the axon as a developmental ‘accident’ and merge Li11 and pseudo-Li11 into a single type."
"But it turns out that Li11 and pseudo-Li11 are distinct types, owing to their different connectivity in the lobula. For example, Li25 has strong LT61 output, while pseudo-Li11 has strong LT11 input. Pseudo-Li11 also exists in the hemibrain , although there it lacks the small projection."
"So the central brain projection of pseudo-Li11 exhibits variability across individuals, further evidence that it is a developmental accident. We introduce the new names Li25 and Li19 to replace Li11 and pseudo-Li11, A few cells were dismissed as developmental accidents. This could be done with high confidence when the cells were small and few in number."
"However, we had difficulty deciding about Li29 because it was a full-field cell in the lobula but it also extended a smaller secondary arbour into the lobula plate . Originally, we decided that this cell was a developmental accident, and did not include it in our list of types. Later on, we found that this odd-looking cell is repeated in the left optic lobe, and promoted it to a type."
"Spatial coverage All cell typing efforts must decide whether to split types more finely or merge types more coarsely. We resolved this lumper–splitter dilemma by using spatial coverage as a criterion2. As a general rule, the cells of a cell type collectively cover all columns of the optic lobe with a density that is fairly uniform across the visual field."
"This makes sense for implementing translation-invariant computations, a strategy that is commonly used in convolutional networks and other computer vision algorithms. Uniform spatial coverage is sometimes called ‘tiling’, although cell type arbours often overlap so much that the analogy to floor tiles is misleading. Spatial coverage is also a property of many cell types in mammalian retina2,56."
"In some types consisting of just one or a few cells, we identified an unconventional jigsaw-style spatial coverage. For example, LPi14, also known as LPi1-210, is a pair of full-field cells . We refer to them as a jigsaw pair because they jointly cover the visual field in an irregular manner, as if they were cut by a jigsaw."
"Jigsaw types can also be found in other interneuron families and include Pm14, Li27 and Li28. Our feature vector  includes no explicit information about the spatial coordinates of a cell. Thus, if clustering feature vectors results in cell types with good spatial coverage, that is an independent validation of the clustering."
"Coverage also solves the lumper–splitter dilemma. Suppose that we attempt to split one type into two candidate types, based on hierarchical clustering. If both candidate types exhibit good coverage, then we accept them as valid."
"If the cells of both candidate types seem randomly scattered, that means our split is invalid, because it is presumably discriminating between cells based on noise. Chromatic types like Tm5 and Dm8 might seem to be an exception to this rule, but their apparently random locations may turn out to depend systematically on pale and yellow columns . The above are easy cases, but there are also edge cases."
"Suppose that splitting results in two candidate types that neatly cover the dorsal field and the ventral field, respectively, without overlap. We then reject the split, preferring to lump the two candidate types in a single type that exhibits dorsoventral spatial variation in connectivity. On the other hand, if one candidate type covers the dorsal field and the other covers the full field, this is an acceptable split."
"With these heuristics, some of our cell types end up with only partial coverage of the visual field . This is especially common for boundary types. Sm is the intrinsic type family containing the most types with partial coverage."
"This makes sense, given that Sm cells interact closely with many boundary types arborizing in the serpentine layer. Cell types with partial coverage make sense in the later stages of vision. After the early stages of vision, computer vision also often discards translation invariance and may perform different visual computations in different regions of the visual field."
"Discussion The connectomic approach to cell typing has three powers. First, it is not subject to the incomplete and biased sampling that can affect other methods. Second, connectivity turns out to provide a rich set of features for distinguishing between cell types."
"Third, connectomic cell typing not only yields cell types, but also, importantly, tells us how they are wired to each other. Implications for visual function We clustered cell types with similar connectivity patterns , and proposed tentative interpretations of the clusters in terms of visual functions. These interpretations are speculations, but should be useful for generating hypotheses that suggest interesting experiments."
"Our hypothetical subsystems are devoted to motion, object and colour vision , and are fed by ON, OFF and luminance channels . The motion subsystem  contains not only the T4 and T5 families but also many interneuron types. Most interneuron types belong to the LPi family, which has been proposed to mediate opponent interactions between cells that are activated by different directions of motion8."
"Such opponency was demonstrated between LPi09 and LPi11, also known as LPi3-4 and LPi4-357. It is likely that LPi types can also mediate spatial normalization, as described in a companion paper37. Of the 51 types in the hypothetical object subsystem , T2 and T3 have been characterized by physiologists as object detectors47."
"Above we hypothesized that a number of other types  are object detectors, and these candidates can be tested by future experiments. The hypothetical colour subsystem  contains 91 types. One can only speculate about the reason for this numeric preponderance."
"Some insects are known to have sophisticated colour vision capabilities such as colour constancy58. The computations required for colour constancy are quite complex, requiring the integration of image information over long ranges59. This could potentially be implemented by the large number of Sm and Li interneuron types in the hypothetical colour subsystem, assuming that Drosophila turns out to exhibit colour constancy."
"Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 1 and cluster 3 have additional functions other than colour vision, and should be subdivided more finely . Future experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. A companion paper predicts that the six types in cluster 2  should exhibit orientation selectivity60, and hypothesizes that cluster 2 is a subsystem for form vision."
"Cluster 2 connects to cluster 1 , suggesting an interaction between form and colour computations. Although we have carved the optic lobe into distinct subsystems, we are aware that it is simplistic to assign every cell type to just one functional subsystem. This is the result of the ‘hard’ clustering algorithm that we have used, which always assigns a cell type to a single cluster."
"In reality, a cell type could have more than one function, or a cell type might mediate interactions between more than one subsystem. The wiring diagrams show many connections between cell types in different subsystems . Assigning such a cell type to a single subsystem is inherently ambiguous."
"Implications for visual development The detailed wiring diagram for an adult visual system precisely specifies the end goal of visual system development. Single-cell transcriptomics is providing detailed information about the molecules in fly visual neurons61–63. Comparison of transcriptomic and connectomic information is already uncovering molecules that are important for the development of the fly visual system64, and this trend is bound to increase in momentum."
"Such research could be aided by our low-dimensional discriminators of cell types . Complete and unbiased Early studies6,32 relied on Golgi staining to sample neurons from multiple individuals, a technique that is best suited for identifying the most numerous types. Most of our new types are not as numerous , which may be why they were missed."
"Furthermore, Golgi studies6 may have mistaken morphological variants for types, which could explain why many of their types cannot be identified in our optic lobe. Contemporary light-microscopy anatomy leverages genetic lines, but still does not evade the limitations of incomplete and biased sampling. The story of Tm5 serves as a case in point."
"A breakthrough in colour vision started by genetically labelling neurons that express the histamine receptor Ort7. Researchers reasoned that Ort would be expressed by cells postsynaptic to the chromatic photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are histaminergic. Then, light-microscopy anatomy was used to make fine distinctions between three Tm5 types labelled in the transgenic line7."
"The present connectomic work has revealed six Tm5 types, a finding that was only foreshadowed by previous work on the same EM dataset42. The three new Tm5 types were presumably missed by previous studies because they receive little or no direct photoreceptor input , and do not express Ort. Nevertheless, they are similar to the old Tm5 types in morphology  and connectivity , and have been grouped in the hypothetical colour subsystem ."
"The Tm5 example demonstrates that connectomics can find fresh patches in well-trodden ground. More telling is that connectomics can guide us to entirely new landscapes, such as the 43 Sm types in an entirely new type family. Distinguishing cell types using connectivity Features based on connectivity  enabled us to discriminate between cell types that stratify in very similar neuropil layers."
"Stratification constrains connectivity, because neurons cannot connect with each other unless they overlap in the same layers1. However, stratification does not completely determine connectivity, because neurons in the same layer may or may not connect with each other. Classical neuroanatomy, whether based on Golgi or genetic staining, relied on stratification because it could be seen with a light microscope."
"Now that we have electron microscopy data, we can rely on connectivity for cell typing, rather than settle for stratification as a proxy2. That being said, the present study used only connectivity at the final stage of cell typing, which was seeded by the morphological types identified during the first and second stages . It was possible to demonstrate self consistency of the final cell types using connectivity-based features only."
"We expect that it should be possible to eliminate all dependence on morphological typing, and base the approach on connectivity from start to finish. This challenge is left for future work. Spatial organization of connectivity According to our wiring diagrams , whether two neurons are connected depends on their cell types."
"Connectivity also depends on the locations of the neurons in the retinotopic maps of the optic lobe. As a trivial example, it is impossible for cells with small arbours to be connected if they are at distant locations. Less trivial dependences of connectivity on location also exist."
"We expect them to be important for understanding vision, although they turned out to be unnecessary for classifying cell types. To facilitate spatial analyses of connectivity, the FlyWire Codex maps a number of cell types to locations in the hexagonal lattice of columns and ommatidia. In such analyses, it may be helpful to regard cell types and spatial locations as discrete and continuous latent variables65."
"A companion paper demonstrates how to predict visual function by characterizing how connectivity depends on both cell type and spatial location. The cell types of cluster 2 are predicted to exhibit orientation selectivity and related phenomena reminiscent of the primary visual cortex60. Artificial intelligence This paper began by recounting the story66 of how wiring diagrams for visual cortex drawn in the 1960s inspired convolutional nets, which eventually sparked the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence."
"Convolutional nets have now been applied to reconstruct the fly brain from electron microscopy images24, making the current study possible. Coming full circle, the fly optic lobe turns out to be as literal an implementation of a convolutional net as one could ever expect from a biological system. The columns of the optic lobe form a hexagonal lattice, rather than the square lattice used in computer vision, but it is a highly regular lattice nonetheless, and the activities of the neurons in each cell type are analogous to a feature map in a convolutional net67."
"Although the connectional architecture of the optic lobe conforms closely to the definition of a convolutional net, the connections do not appear to be learned in the sense of artificial intelligence. No changes in VPN structure68 and function69, and only subtle changes in visual behaviour70 have been detected after rearing flies in darkness, suggesting that visual experience may have little role in Drosophila visual development. However, mechanisms based on spontaneous activity in the pupal brain  might have a role71."
"Implications for mammalian cell types In the central brain of Drosophila, cell types usually consist of just a pair of mirror symmetric neurons9,25 , as is also the case for C. elegans72. By contrast, most optic lobe cell types are represented by many neurons , a situation that is more reminiscent of mammalian brains3,73."
"Could our connectomic approach generalize to mammalian brain structures such as retina and cortex, which are laminated like the optic lobe? Single-cell transcriptomics, often hailed as the solution to classifying cortical cell types74, has also been applied to the Drosophila optic lobe. One study reported 172 transcriptomic cell types, a figure that includes VPNs as well as intrinsic neurons62."
"Our connectomic study has revealed the existence of a much larger set of types . Encouragingly, many connectomic types can be conclusively matched with transcriptomic types62. Failures to match are interesting because they illustrate potential pitfalls of the transcriptomic approach."
"For example, all eight T4/T5 types look like a single transcriptomic type in adult flies62, and are only transcriptionally distinct at earlier stages of development. This could be analogous to the fact that adult cortical neurons of the same transcriptomic type can have highly variable morphological properties75,76. It will be important to scale up the connectomic approach, and make it as definitive for the cortex as it is now for the fly visual system."
"A first attempt has already been made in visual cortex19. As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function."
"Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analysing its structure to predict that three Dm3  and three TmY  cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity, and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical5,6 receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning7, position invariance8,9 and completion of noisy or illusory contours10,11."
"The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain12,13, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision14. The 40,000 neurons in an optic lobe of the Drosophila brain15–17 have now been completely classified into cell types4."
"Although the 200+ cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe are well defined by structural analysis, their functions are largely unknown because less than 20% have had their visual responses recorded by neurophysiologists. For the most part, at present the online catalogue of visual cell types  is an enigmatic museum of structures without functions. A beautiful example is Dm3, a trio of neuronal cell types that are intrinsic to the distal medulla."
"A Dm3 cell is tangentially oriented , and is orthogonal to the columnar cells that project from the medulla to other neuropils . The three Dm3 types are easily distinguished from each other because their dendrites point in three directions4 . For interactive visualizations of cells and pathways, see the URLs in Supplementary Data 1."
"Dm3 was originally called the line amacrine cell when it was discovered in 1970 in dipterans1. It was named Dm3 in Drosophila in 19892, and split into two types in 20153,18,19. A third Dm3 type was recently identified in a large-scale connectomic census4."
No recordings of Dm3 visual responses have ever been reported by physiologists. Dm3 function has remained unknown. I will begin by attempting to predict Dm3 function from structure.
"The field of connectomics has been motivated by a conviction that the computational capabilities of the brain depend strongly on the connectome20,21. Indeed, neural circuit functions such as the computation of visual motion22, heading direction23, and reward and punishment signals24 are now known to be supported by specific patterns of neural connectivity in the Drosophila brain. These successes of structural explanation came after neurophysiologists had already identified circuit functions25–27."
"The present study attempts to go beyond explaining post facto. I tackle the challenge of predicting function ex ante, a more stringent test of the power of structure–function relationships. Predictions of Dm3 receptive fields The receptive field of a visual neuron was classically defined as “the region of the retina which must be illuminated in order to obtain a response”28."
"I predict Dm3 receptive fields by mapping their input connections from Tm1, a cell type that is in one-to-one correspondence with the hexels  of the compound eye . Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3 , and Dm3 is a strong output of Tm1 . Figure 1e shows a typical Dm3 cell receiving strong Tm1 input in three collinear columns, even though the cell extends over many columns ."
The Tm1 cells presynaptic to each Dm3v cell were mapped to a hexagonal lattice . The colour of each hexel indicates the number of synapses received by the Dm3v cell from Tm1 cells. Aligning  and averaging all maps yielded an average Tm1–Dm3v input map .
This procedure was repeated for all three Dm3 types. The resulting average maps  show that the three Dm3 types are aligned to the three cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice29 . Cell-to-cell variation is visible in the individual maps for single Dm3 cells .
"To quantify variability, each Tm1–Dm3 connectivity map was approximated as an ellipse . The distributions of angular orientations for the Dm3 populations overlap little , and the median angles are close to the cardinal orientations of the hexagonal lattice. The aspect ratios of the ellipses have median values near 4 for all Dm3 populations ."
"To further characterize the size and shape of the predicted receptive fields, one-dimensional  projections of Tm1–Dm3 maps were computed . The longitudinal and transverse projections provide information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively. Standard deviations are marked to provide information about variability across cells."
"The Tm1 receptive field is radially symmetric, with a centre that is about one ommatidium wide30. As this is so narrow, Tm1–Dm3 connectivity maps  can be regarded as estimates of Dm3 receptive fields, assuming that a Dm3 cell sums inputs from its presynaptic Tm1 cells. Orientation selectivity was discovered in mammalian primary visual cortex, and found to be related to spatial orientation of the receptive field31."
"As the predicted receptive fields of Dm3 are oriented, I likewise predict that Dm3 cells prefer stimuli at the three cardinal orientations. Although Tm1 is the strongest input to Dm3 by a large margin , Dm3 also receives weaker input from other ‘hexel cell types’ . Maps of their connectivity with Dm3 look similar to Tm1–Dm3 maps ."
"Like Tm1, these inputs  are known to have receptive field centres that are roughly a single ommatidium in width30,32,33, and therefore are not expected to change the shape of the receptive field estimated from Tm1. All of these inputs are consistent with the prediction that Dm3 cells have OFF receptive fields . Predictions of TmY receptive fields Top targets of Dm3 include TmY4 and TmY9 , which project from the distal medulla to the lobula and lobula plate2 ."
"In the distal medulla, TmY4 dendrites are horizontally oriented, extending symmetrically on two sides of the main trunk . TmY9 has been split into TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ . In the distal medulla, both TmY9 types have dendrites that are asymmetrically directed to one side of the main trunk along the q and q⟂ directions."
"Tm1 is one of the top inputs to TmY4 and TmY9 . Once again, I predict receptive fields by mapping Tm1 inputs. The average maps have three distinct orientations ."
"Cell-to-cell variability  is visualized by approximating ellipses . The median orientations of the TmY4 and TmY9q⟂ ellipses are well approximated by the horizontal and q⟂ orientations of the hexagonal lattice . The median orientation of the TmY9q ellipses is between the q and p⟂ orientations, and closer to q ."
"Roughly speaking, each TmY orientation is orthogonal to one of the Dm3 orientations, although the orthogonality of TmY9q and Dm3p is less than perfect. Aspect ratios of the ellipses indicate the degree of anisotropy . Longitudinal and transverse 1D projections of Tm1–TmY maps  provide complementary information about the length and width of the predicted receptive field, respectively."
"From these estimates of receptive fields, TmY4, TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ are predicted to prefer visual stimuli at the horizontal, q and q⟂ orientations, respectively. On the basis of their strong Tm1 inputs, TmY4 and TmY9 are predicted to be OFF cells, although they also receive input from the ON hexel type Mi1 . Monosynaptic inputs to individual TmY cells from Tm1, Mi1 and other hexel types are mapped in Supplementary Data 4."
"Connectivity between Dm3 and TmY types Dm3 and TmY neurons are also connected with each other . Dm3 will be presumed inhibitory in its synaptic effects on other cells, and TmY will be presumed excitatory, on the basis of evidence from both electron micrographs and transcriptomic data . Each Dm3 type avoids synapsing onto cells of the same type, and prefers to synapse onto the other two Dm3 types, which have different dendrite orientations ."
"Each Dm3 type prefers to synapse onto a single TmY type, that with the orthogonal dendrite orientation . Therefore, Dm3 output connectivity conforms to cross-orientation inhibition, a connectivity motif proposed for visual cortex more than 50 years ago34,35. TmY cells prefer to synapse onto TmY cells of the same type ."
"It follows that TmY–TmY connectivity conforms approximately to iso-orientation excitation, a connectivity motif proposed for visual cortex more than 40 years ago8. In addition, there is some weaker connectivity from TmY9q to TmY9q⟂ . TmY4 and TmY9q cells synapse onto Dm3 cells of the orthogonal orientation ."
"By contrast, TmY9q⟂ shows no preference, synapsing onto Dm3 cells of all orientations . Therefore TmY-to-Dm3 connectivity is a combination of cross-orientation and indiscriminate connectivity. The above connectivity patterns are represented schematically in Fig."
3b. This is effectively a thresholded version of Fig. 3a that will be used in subsequent analyses.
"Figure 3c illustrates a Dm3 cell synapsing onto another Dm3 cell, which in turn synapses onto a TmY cell. Figure 3d illustrates reciprocally connected TmY4 cells. These visualizations suggest that there are spatial relationships  between the connected cells, which are not described by population-level wiring diagrams ."
The consequences of these spatial relationships for visual responses of cells will be predicted below. Dm3 extraclassical receptive fields The receptive field predictions of Figs. 1 and 2 were for the ‘classical’ receptive field .
"For some visual neurons, stimulation of areas outside the CRF may modulate the response to stimulation of the CRF5. These areas are sometimes called the ‘extraclassical’ receptive field . By definition, stimulating the ERF alone , should not result in any response."
"The amount of modulation induced by ERF stimulation may depend on the orientation, contrast or other properties of the modulating stimulus6. Locations outside an oriented CRF near the longitudinal axis will be called the end zones, and locations near the transverse axis will be called the side zones . I propose that the ERF of Dm3 cells is determined by disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3."
". I searched for such pathways with the greatest anatomical strength. In brief, the strength of the A-to-B connection was defined as the fraction of input synapses to cell type B provided by cell type A."
"The strength of the A-to-B-to-C disynaptic pathway was then defined as the product of the A-to-B and B-to-C strengths. Details about this strength estimate and its limitations are given in the Methods. Strong disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 were mapped , aligned and averaged across Dm3 cells ."
"For each Dm3 type, the average disynaptic pathway map overlaps with the average predicted CRF , but also extends beyond it. The beyond-the-CRF portion of each disynaptic pathway map will be regarded as a component of the predicted ERF. Henceforth, ‘pERF’ and ‘pCRF’ will be used as abbreviations for the predicted ERF component and predicted CRF, respectively."
"As the maps do not have sharp borders, they will be approximated as ellipses for the purpose of defining beyond-the-CRF regions . For each Dm3 type, the strongest two pERFs are from the other two Dm3 types. These mostly extend into the side zones of the pCRF , and are predicted to be suppressive because Dm3 is presumed inhibitory."
"Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning7. The next strongest pERF is mediated by T2a, and is predicted to be facilitating because T2a is presumed excitatory . The T2a-mediated average pERF covers both end zones of the Dm3v pCRF , and mainly the posterior end zone of the Dm3p and Dm3q pCRFs ."
"Ellipse approximations to Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps for individual Dm3 cells show that their orientations tend to be similar to those of the Dm3 pCRFs . For some Dm3p and Dm3q cells, the Tm1–T2a–Dm3 map is small and located in the pCRF end zone, not overlapping with the pCRF at all. This shows up as a hotspot in the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps ."
"1D projections of the average Tm1–T2a–Dm3 maps  show that they tend to be longer than the pCRFs, and result in pERFs that are biased towards the posterior pCRF end zone of Dm3p  and Dm3q . The remaining disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to Dm3 are substantially weaker by anatomical strength , but are included for completeness because they might turn out to be physiologically strong. It is not easy to predict the overall effect at locations where suppressive and facilitating pERFs overlap."
"I predict that suppression will be prominent in the pCRF side zones, where the Dm3-mediated pERFs seem numerically stronger. In the end zones, the T2a-mediated pERFs are largely unopposed by suppression, and should lead to facilitation that is not selective for orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus. pERFs for individual Dm3 cells are provided in Supplementary Data 3."
"There is considerable variability across cells of the same type, but the geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. TmY extraclassical receptive fields I predict the ERF of TmY cells by considering disynaptic pathways from Tm1 to TmY types. The strongest pathways are mediated by Dm3 , and the resulting pERF covers mainly the pCRF side zones and is expected to be suppressive ."
"Such cross-orientation suppression could have the function of sharpening orientation tuning7. Of the weaker pERFs that are facilitating , the TmY–TmY pERF extends the farthest into the pCRF end zones . Ellipse approximations show the degree of variability across cells ."
"1D projections show that the pERF extends into both end zones . This pathway could lead to iso-orientation facilitation in the end zones, as the TmY–TmY connections are between the same TmY type. The extension of the facilitating TmY–TmY pERF into the pCRF end zones is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity aids in the completion of noisy or illusory contours."
"A similar ‘collinear facilitation’ in visual cortex has been proposed to enable completion of noisy or illusory contours, because an orientation detector receiving weak or ambiguous input from the image can be driven over threshold by excitation from neighbouring orientation detectors10,11,36. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones. This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity8,9."
"pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in Supplementary Data 4. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells. Prediction of spatial normalization The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute."
"Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation . In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY ."
"A similar excitatory–inhibitory motif is found for many types in the Dm interneuron family and can be viewed as implementing spatial normalization, a common computation in image processing37. The inhibitory neuron pools activity of excitatory neurons over some spatial neighbourhood, and sends recurrent inhibition back to the same excitatory neurons. An unusual aspect here is that recurrent inhibition in the Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY pathway is opposed by recurrent excitation in the Tm1–TmY–TmY pathway, in the case of side-by-side stimuli at the preferred orientation."
"Pathways leaving the optic lobe I have predicted that the three Dm3 and three TmY types respond selectively to the local orientation of a visual stimulus. This is conceptualized as a decomposition of the image into small oriented elements such as edges or bars, similar to early visual processing in computer science38 as well as models of visual cortex39. In such models, the computation of local orientation is a general starting point for recognizing all visual forms by subsequent processing steps."
"Similarly, information about local stimulus orientation might be used by the fly brain for form vision. TmY cells synapse onto a number of visual projection neurons  that project out of the optic lobe into the central brain. I will focus on the most numerous of these VPN types, LC15 and LC10e, which number about 50 cells each ."
"These are of particular interest, because they retain more information about location and are therefore potentially more useful for recognizing complex visual forms. The other VPNs, by contrast, discard more information about location by pooling widely over space, and will be studied elsewhere. LC15 invariance to orientation LC15 neurons project from the lobula to the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum , a neuropil in the central brain13 ."
"LC15 receives input from all three TmY types . Direct connections from hexel types to LC15 are weak or non-existent, so here the top disynaptic pathways are mapped to predict feature selectivity . Aligning and averaging the maps yields Fig."
"6b. Maps for individual cells are in Supplementary Data 5, and are summarized by ellipses in Fig. 6c."
"Given that LC15 input from TmY cells of all three orientations is indiscriminate, it is natural to reason that LC15 responds indiscriminately to any orientation, detecting a disjunction  of activity in the three channels. If TmY orientation tuning is sufficiently broad, it follows that LC15 should be activated by a stimulus of any orientation. Indeed, recordings of LC15 visual responses show that LC15 is activated by bars of any orientation40,41."
"Other strong intermediaries of disynaptic pathways include T3, Tm25 and Tm21 . T3 is known to be a small-object detector42, and Tm25 and Tm21 may be object detectors on the basis of their connectivity4. Indeed, recordings of LC15 responses show that LC15 is also activated by small objects, although not as strongly as by bars40,41."
"LC10e as possible junction detector LC10 neurons project from the lobula to the anterior optic tubercle of the central brain12 . LC10 has been divided into four types  with distinct stratification profiles in the lobula13. I identified a new LC10e type, and further subdivided it into dorsal and ventral variants  on the basis of their distinct connectivity patterns ."
"Both variants receive inputs from TmY9 types, but these inputs are stronger for LC10ev , so I will focus on it. Disynaptic pathways starting from hexel types were mapped, and the top intermediaries turned out to be TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ . The maps were aligned and averaged ."
The average Tm1–TmY9q–LC10ev map is to the left of the average Tm1–TmY9q⟂–LC10ev map . The displacement vectors between ellipse centres  are within 90° of the q direction for almost all LC10ev cells. This suggests a systematic spatial relationship between the receptive field components mediated by TmY9q and TmY9q⟂.
"Noisiness in this relationship is evident in the maps for individual cells , but many individual cells are consistent with the systematic relationship. Although LC10ev receives input from both TmY9q and TmY9q⟂, it is unclear how these two pathways interact. One possibility is that LC10ev, like LC15, detects a disjunction of activity in two pathways, and responds to a stimulus at either the q or q⟂ orientation."
"Another possibility is that LC10ev detects a conjunction  of activity in the two pathways. In the latter case, LC10ev could be a detector of corners or T-junctions, owing to the systematic spatial relationship evident in Fig. 6e,f."
"This is just a speculation, because there are additional strong inputs to LC10ev other than TmY9 , and it is unclear how they shape the feature selectivity of LC10ev. Motion, object and colour vision TmY pERFs mediated by T4 and T5 cells  cover the pCRF end zones, and are facilitating. T4 and T5 neurons are activated by motion, and are also known to prefer oriented stimuli43."
"Therefore, input from the motion system may enhance the orientation selectivity of TmY cells, and also cause TmY responses to be stronger for moving stimuli than for flashed stimuli. Dm3 inputs and outputs do not contain cell types known to encode motion direction . TmY4 receives inhibition from several lobula plate interneurons, including the full-field cells LPi14 and LPi15 , which are presumed to be inhibitory , and receive strong input from T4a and T5a, and from T4b and T5b, respectively."
"This suggests that TmY4 might be suppressed by horizontal background motion. TmY9q⟂  receives input from LPi07 , suggesting that TmY9q⟂  might be suppressed by vertical background motion if LPi07 is inhibitory, because LPi07 receives input from T4c and T5c, and from T4d and T5d. TmY outputs include motion-related types."
"TmY4 synapses onto LPi07 cells , which synapse onto T4c and T5c, and from T4d and T5d. TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ synapse onto a number of types  that are reciprocally coupled to T4 and T5 cells4,44. The TmY–TmY pERFs also extend slightly into the pCRF side zones."
"This is consistent with the idea that TmY–TmY connectivity can give rise to positional invariance while preserving orientation selectivity8,9. pERFs and pCRFs for individual TmY cells are provided in Supplementary Data 4. The geometric relationships evident in the average pERFs do hold for many individual cells."
"Prediction of spatial normalization The TmY pERF was predicted above by disynaptic pathways terminating at TmY, but trisynaptic or longer pathways could also contribute. Of particular interest is Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY, which involves recurrent inhibition of TmY by Dm3. This pathway is expected to contribute a suppressive pERF located in the far side zones of the pCRF and tuned to the preferred orientation ."
"In the near side zones, this pathway could be obscured by a facilitating pERF due to Tm1–TmY–TmY . A similar excitatory–inhibitory motif is found for many types in the Dm interneuron family and can be viewed as implementing spatial normalization, a common computation in image processing37. The inhibitory neuron pools activity of excitatory neurons over some spatial neighbourhood, and sends recurrent inhibition back to the same excitatory neurons."
"An unusual aspect here is that recurrent inhibition in the Tm1–TmY–Dm3–TmY pathway is opposed by recurrent excitation in the Tm1–TmY–TmY pathway, in the case of side-by-side stimuli at the preferred orientation. Pathways leaving the optic lobe I have predicted that the three Dm3 and three TmY types respond selectively to the local orientation of a visual stimulus. This is conceptualized as a decomposition of the image into small oriented elements such as edges or bars, similar to early visual processing in computer science38 as well as models of visual cortex39."
"In such models, the computation of local orientation is a general starting point for recognizing all visual forms by subsequent processing steps. Similarly, information about local stimulus orientation might be used by the fly brain for form vision. TmY cells synapse onto a number of visual projection neurons  that project out of the optic lobe into the central brain."
"I will focus on the most numerous of these VPN types, LC15 and LC10e, which number about 50 cells each . These are of particular interest, because they retain more information about location and are therefore potentially more useful for recognizing complex visual forms. The other VPNs, by contrast, discard more information about location by pooling widely over space, and will be studied elsewhere."
"LC15 invariance to orientation LC15 neurons project from the lobula to the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum , a neuropil in the central brain13 . LC15 receives input from all three TmY types . Direct connections from hexel types to LC15 are weak or non-existent, so here the top disynaptic pathways are mapped to predict feature selectivity ."
"Aligning and averaging the maps yields Fig. 6b. Maps for individual cells are in Supplementary Data 5, and are summarized by ellipses in Fig."
"6c. Given that LC15 input from TmY cells of all three orientations is indiscriminate, it is natural to reason that LC15 responds indiscriminately to any orientation, detecting a disjunction  of activity in the three channels. If TmY orientation tuning is sufficiently broad, it follows that LC15 should be activated by a stimulus of any orientation."
"Indeed, recordings of LC15 visual responses show that LC15 is activated by bars of any orientation40,41. Other strong intermediaries of disynaptic pathways include T3, Tm25 and Tm21 . T3 is known to be a small-object detector42, and Tm25 and Tm21 may be object detectors on the basis of their connectivity4."
"Indeed, recordings of LC15 responses show that LC15 is also activated by small objects, although not as strongly as by bars40,41. LC10e as possible junction detector LC10 neurons project from the lobula to the anterior optic tubercle of the central brain12 . LC10 has been divided into four types  with distinct stratification profiles in the lobula13."
"I identified a new LC10e type, and further subdivided it into dorsal and ventral variants  on the basis of their distinct connectivity patterns . Both variants receive inputs from TmY9 types, but these inputs are stronger for LC10ev , so I will focus on it. Disynaptic pathways starting from hexel types were mapped, and the top intermediaries turned out to be TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ ."
The maps were aligned and averaged . The average Tm1–TmY9q–LC10ev map is to the left of the average Tm1–TmY9q⟂–LC10ev map . The displacement vectors between ellipse centres  are within 90° of the q direction for almost all LC10ev cells.
"This suggests a systematic spatial relationship between the receptive field components mediated by TmY9q and TmY9q⟂. Noisiness in this relationship is evident in the maps for individual cells , but many individual cells are consistent with the systematic relationship. Although LC10ev receives input from both TmY9q and TmY9q⟂, it is unclear how these two pathways interact."
"One possibility is that LC10ev, like LC15, detects a disjunction of activity in two pathways, and responds to a stimulus at either the q or q⟂ orientation. Another possibility is that LC10ev detects a conjunction  of activity in the two pathways. In the latter case, LC10ev could be a detector of corners or T-junctions, owing to the systematic spatial relationship evident in Fig."
"6e,f. This is just a speculation, because there are additional strong inputs to LC10ev other than TmY9 , and it is unclear how they shape the feature selectivity of LC10ev. Motion, object and colour vision TmY pERFs mediated by T4 and T5 cells  cover the pCRF end zones, and are facilitating."
"T4 and T5 neurons are activated by motion, and are also known to prefer oriented stimuli43. Therefore, input from the motion system may enhance the orientation selectivity of TmY cells, and also cause TmY responses to be stronger for moving stimuli than for flashed stimuli. Dm3 inputs and outputs do not contain cell types known to encode motion direction ."
"TmY4 receives inhibition from several lobula plate interneurons, including the full-field cells LPi14 and LPi15 , which are presumed to be inhibitory , and receive strong input from T4a and T5a, and from T4b and T5b, respectively. This suggests that TmY4 might be suppressed by horizontal background motion. TmY9q⟂  receives input from LPi07 , suggesting that TmY9q⟂  might be suppressed by vertical background motion if LPi07 is inhibitory, because LPi07 receives input from T4c and T5c, and from T4d and T5d."
"TmY outputs include motion-related types. TmY4 synapses onto LPi07 cells , which synapse onto T4c and T5c, and from T4d and T5d. TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ synapse onto a number of types  that are reciprocally coupled to T4 and T5 cells4,44."
"as TmY9 . Recordings of these additional intermediary types have not been reported, but a companion paper uses connectivity to speculate that they are involved in colour vision4. Predictions and their limitations By interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram, I have predicted visual responses of Drosophila neurons that have not previously been recorded by neurophysiologists."
"Testing these predictions seems bound to be informative, whether or not they turn out to be correct. CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted by mapping monosynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells, and found to be oriented . On this basis, Dm3 and TmY cells were predicted to be orientation selective."
"pERFs were predicted by mapping disynaptic pathways from Tm1 cells , which involve connections in the Dm3–TmY circuit . A Dm3 pERF mediated by other Dm3 types was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones, and tuned to non-preferred orientations. A Dm3 pERF mediated by T2a was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones, and not tuned to the orientation or contrast of the modulating stimulus ."
"A TmY pERF mediated by TmY was predicted to be facilitating in the pCRF end zones and near side zones, and tuned to modulating stimuli at the pCRF orientation . A TmY pERF mediated by Dm3 was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones and tuned to modulating stimuli orthogonal to the pCRF orientation . A TmY pERF due to a trisynaptic pathway mediated by both the same TmY type and the orthogonal Dm3 type was predicted to be suppressive in the pCRF side zones for stimuli at the pCRF orientation ."
"Although my predictions are powerfully concrete and specific, they also have limitations. First, I relied on the fundamental assumption that the CRF arises from monosynaptic connectivity, and that the ERF arises from polysynaptic pathways that are not paralleled by a monosynaptic connection. One can be confident about the assumption for an inhibitory pathway such as Tm1–Dm3v–TmY4, which by itself should be incapable of activating the TmY4 cell."
"However, stimulating an excitatory pathway such as Tm1–TmY4–TmY4 could conceivably activate the final TmY4 cell, even if the direct Tm1–TmY4 pathway is not stimulated. In general, my fundamental assumption is more certain for inhibitory and less certain for excitatory polysynaptic pathways. If experiments show that the size and shape of CRFs match the predictions of Figs."
"1 and 2, then the fundamental assumption will be upheld, and further experiments can proceed to look for the predicted facilitating and suppressive ERF components. On the other hand, if the CRF turns out to be longer than predicted, that would mean excitatory polysynaptic pathways, here predicted to contribute to the ERF, instead turn out to lengthen the CRF. The prediction of a facilitating ERF in the CRF end zone would become invalid, because the end zone would be swallowed up by the lengthened CRF."
The ERF would then be determined solely by inhibitory polysynaptic pathways and be only suppressive. The above uncertainty is related to some ambiguity inherent in the ERF definition5. It is supposed to be impossible to evoke a neural response through stimulation of the ERF alone .
"If the definition is revised to substitute difficult for impossible, the distinction between ERF and CRF is no longer black and white. In the second limitation, predictions can be challenging owing to the existence of many polysynaptic pathways that can contribute to the ERF . When relevant pathways are both excitatory and inhibitory, it can be difficult to predict the overall sign  of modulation by a stimulus outside the CRF."
"I have accordingly focused my ERF predictions on locations where either excitation or inhibition is likely to dominate. However, there are additional ERF pathways that were not considered above. For example, a companion paper37 predicts numerous normalization mechanisms that are presynaptic to the Dm3–TmY circuit: Tm1 responses are spatially normalized by five Pm interneuron types that pool over multiple length scales , L2  is normalized by three Dm interneuron types, and the L2–Tm1 connection is normalized by two Dm interneuron types."
"All of these mechanisms are expected to contribute suppressive ERF components that are not tuned to stimulus orientation, and could obscure the predicted facilitating ERF components. A third limitation concerns variation across cells of the same type, which is summarized by the ellipses in Figs. 1h, 2j, 4d, 5d, 6c,f and detailed in Supplementary Data 3–5."
"A systematic kind of variation is the distortion of geometric relationships near the borders of the eye. There is also apparently random variation even in the interior of the eye, far from the borders. pERFs tend to look more variable  than pCRFs , which may be due in part to randomness in the coverage of the visual field by non-hexel types."
"Finally, my conjecture about LC10e assumes a high threshold for activation, which suggests that LC10e should detect a conjunction of TmY9q and TmY9q⟂ activation, triggered by two oriented stimuli arranged in a corner or T-junction . Alternatively, LC10e might detect a disjunction of its inputs, if it has a low threshold for activation. LC15 is indiscriminately connected with all three TmY types, and its observed invariance to stimulus orientation40,41 suggests that LC15 has a low threshold for activation."
"An additional subtlety, not further discussed here, is that threshold actually varies dynamically owing to the presence of inhibitory inputs. In principle, some of the above limitations could be overcome by building network models of neural activity. That might not improve the predictive power at this time, however, because so many model parameters are unknown at present."
"Synapse counts are only crude estimates of physiological connection strength14, and unitary conductance can differ markedly between inhibitory and excitatory synapses45. Other uncertainties, such as whether inhibition should be modelled as subtractive or divisive46, go beyond parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out experiments that reduce model uncertainty."
"If visual physiologists measure orientation and location tuning curves, that would constrain the strength of cross-orientation inhibition relative to direct Tm1 excitation, as well as the relative strengths of ERF pathways. Biophysical experiments would clarify the extent to which voltage varies throughout a neuronal arbour47–49, which is important because pCRF and pERF pathways may terminate in synapses at different locations on the arbour. Discussion Convolutional nets are a popular approach to form vision in artificial intelligence."
"Optic lobe cell types can be interpreted as feature maps in a convolutional net50, and average Tm1–Dm3  and Tm1–TmY  connectivity maps can be interpreted as convolution kernels. LC10e and LC15 combine inputs from TmY cells, and may be regarded as complex feature detectors built by combining inputs from simpler feature detectors. This accords with the original hierarchical conception of convolutional nets39, which was inspired by hypothetical wiring diagrams for primary visual cortex  in mammals31."
"The wiring of the Dm3–TmY circuit resembles connectivity motifs originally proposed for V1 , and some visual responses predicted here for fly neurons have precedents in V1. In particular, a ‘collinear facilitation’ is predicted for the ERF of TmY cells, meaning that a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the end zone can facilitate the response to a stimulus of the preferred orientation in the CRF. Collinear facilitation was previously reported for V1 neurons10,11,36, but most reports emphasize suppression6."
"The conflicting reports might be reconciled if ERFs are generated by diverse parallel polysynaptic pathways6. Different visual stimuli might emphasize either excitatory or inhibitory pathways, leading to different experimental results. The ERFs of TmY cells are similarly predicted to be shaped by many overlapping excitatory and inhibitory pathways , but the complexity is constrained by the connectome."
"We can reason about the cell types and connections , observe and manipulate them with the aid of genetic tools, and use them to build neural network models. This new opportunity has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods used to disentangle the effects of overlapping ERF mechanisms in the cortex, such as manipulating stimulus contrast, orientation and timing6,51. ‘Line amacrine’ cells probably homologous to Dm3 have been described in several dipteran species1."
"If Dm3 and TmY homologues turn out to exist in honeybees, it will be worth comparing with studies of honeybee behaviour, with the caveat that visual acuity is higher and inter-ommatidial spacing is lower in honeybees than in Drosophila52. Behavioural experiments were interpreted to infer the existence of “at least three orientation-sensitive channels” in the bee visual system53,54. Orientation-selective neurons were later predicted to span a maximum of three ommatidia55."
"This roughly matches the predicted CRFs of Dm3 and TmY cells. It is worth noting that Dm3 receptive fields would not previously have been guessed to be so short, because Dm3 dendrites are quite long . The predicted CRFs require true connectivity, not just morphology."
"The collinear facilitation predicted for TmY cells could have consequences for insect visual behaviours. Bees were once claimed to perceive illusory contours56,57. The experiments were later declared to be irreproducible58,59, although this belated renunciation seems to have escaped notice60."
"The topic seems worth reopening, if neurophysiology experiments can detect the collinear facilitation predicted here. The design of illusory contour stimuli seems more likely to be successful if guided by neurophysiology as well as behaviour. Behavioural experiments with honeybees were used to argue that the orientation of a visual stimulus is computed independently from its direction of motion53."
"Orientation selectivity was subsequently discovered in direction-selective T4 and T5 cells of Drosophila43. The present work predicts an orientation-selective Dm3–TmY circuit that is indeed distinct from the motion circuit, although there are interactions between them as described above. The Dm3–TmY circuit immediately suggests many questions about neural development."
"Unknowns include the identities of the molecules that guide Dm3 dendrites to grow in three directions, and how the Dm3 dendrites ‘decide’ how far to grow, even after turning sharply at the border of the medulla . The molecules that establish connectivity preferences of Dm3 and TmY cells  are of obvious interest. There should also be molecules that establish preferences for synapse formation at particular dendritic locations, which are important for the spatial organization of connectivity  and remain to be analysed in future work."
"Many animals use visual information to navigate1–4, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction5 by integrating visual input from ER neurons6–12, which are part of the anterior visual pathway 10,13–16. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data17."
"The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons10,14,15, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle  in the central brain; TuBu neurons9,16, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons6–12, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input."
"We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations. The AVP encodes visual features that are essential for navigation, potentially including landmarks, intensity gradients, colour, celestial bodies and skylight polarization1,5,11,18–22."
"Considering its fundamental role in navigation, it is not surprising that this anatomical structure is largely conserved across most known insect species10,23–25. It is likely that deep similarities exist across species in the basic logic of visual feature extraction for navigation19,23–28. However, despite many studies of the AVP across species, researchers’ knowledge about the AVP neurons has been fragmented by the lack of a complete circuit diagram to frame systematic investigations."
"Here we aim to provide such a framework in flies, and we anticipate that this will also be invaluable for designing and prioritizing physiological experiments to interrogate the AVP in other species. We identified all neurons  and their connectivity  in the AVP, using a publicly available electron-microscopy  dataset  that contains the entire adult fly brain, with FlyWire, an AI-assisted collaborative platform17,29,30 . MeTu neurons, the first stage of the AVP, leave the medulla, the largest neuropil in the fly visual system31–36."
"The axons of MeTu neurons innervate the AOTUsu10,14,16,32,37,38 , where the information is further processed by the TuBu neurons that connect the AOTUsu to the bulb10,11,38 . There are ten classes of TuBu neurons , each synapsing onto the dendrites of distinct classes of ER neurons . ER neurons then send ring-like processes to a donut-shaped structure, the ellipsoid body16,39,40 , where they together form a complex recurrent neural network5,41,42 ."
"Finally, the visual information from the AVP—along with other sensory modalities43—is compiled to compute the heading direction by EPG neurons5 that share many similarities with mammalian ‘head direction’ cells5. Our survey of the entire brain29 showed that visual information originating from optic lobe structures outside the AVP  constitutes minimal input to EPG neurons . Thus, we focused our analyses on the medulla-originating AVP."
"Furthermore, although previous anatomical studies of various types of MeTu neuron have generally agreed at the macroscale10,14,15 , the insufficient resolution of light microscopy has resulted in considerable inconsistencies in grouping MeTu types and predicting their connectivity towards the central complex . Hence, we sought to provide a comprehensive view of this pathway in synapse-level detail. Finally, although the connectivity from TuBu to ER to EPG neurons has been studied at synaptic resolution16 , this dataset contains only one hemisphere and lacks upstream medulla neuropils and photoreceptor terminals."
"Therefore, we sought to reconstruct the entire AVP in both hemispheres  to provide a solid foundation for understanding how brains vary across hemispheres and across animals, as well as which visual features are extracted in the AVP. Reconstruction of the AVP We densely proofread all MeTu neurons , TuBu neurons , and ER neurons . We further reconstructed all medulla-intrinsic Mi1 neurons in the medulla  from both hemispheres  to map the exact locations of all reconstructed neurons relative to the retinotopic columns in the medulla."
"To assess our proofreading quality29, we selected 113  MeTu neurons from the right hemisphere and performed multiple rounds of proofreading . We found that—after the first round—any additional volume reconstructed in each round markedly decreased and there were no changes in the main backbone . Moreover, all MeTu neurons  shared stereotypical arborization patterns in the medulla."
"Therefore, we were confident that our reconstruction quality of the 894 MeTu neurons was sufficiently accurate for categorization and morphological and connectivity analyses. We focused on the detailed connectivity of MeTu neurons because the logic of their connections between optic lobes and the central brain was missing in previous studies16. We included results from both hemispheres in most analyses, but, where indicated, some detailed analyses were restricted to the right hemisphere because the left hemisphere had an incomplete lamina and  EM image alignment issues17,29,44."
"AOTUsu anatomy defines four MeTu classes The AOTUsu is innervated by four types of processes: the axons of MeTu neurons; the dendrites of downstream TuBu neurons ; and the synaptic terminals of bilaterally projecting AOTU046 and tubercle-to-tubercle  neurons16. Drawing on the axonal arborization pattern of MeTu and the dendritic arborization pattern of TuBu, we divided the AOTUsu into four major subregions: posterior lateral , posterior central , anterior  and medial . These anatomical divisions led us to categorize MeTu neurons into four major classes ."
"Downstream TuBu neurons were categorized into ten types, consistent with previous works . See Extended Data Fig. 3 for a detailed anatomical description of these four areas and the neurons that innervate them."
"Connectivity reveals ten MeTu subtypes Within each MeTu class except MeTu1, we observed discrete morphologies and anatomical innervations, suggesting multiple channels for visual features. To systematically categorize all possible MeTu neuron subtypes, we focused our analysis on the 5 strongest synaptic partner types; this resulted in 28 types of upstream neuron. Applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction analysis  based on the connectivity in the medulla but not in the AOTUsu revealed four major patterns of presynaptic inputs, mostly consistent with the four major MeTu classes defined in the previous section ."
"We also performed categorization analyses  and found ten subtypes. Comparing the expression pattern of genetic driver lines  with EM data further corroborated our subtyping of MeTu neurons. MeTu1 neurons form a homogeneous group Compass neurons are strongly influenced by vertical stripes and their locations in azimuth5,7, whose information is conveyed by ER neurons, probably ER4d6,9,12,39."
"This ER neuron type is the only partner downstream of TuBu08, which is, in turn, the only neuron type downstream of MeTu1 neurons : Our analysis of the anatomy and connectivity of MeTu1 neurons helps to explain the mechanisms that underlie the selectivity of ER4d neurons. MeTu1 neurons  form thick dendritic branches in the medulla layer 7, with small vertical protrusions extending to layer 6 . Dendrites span about 30–40 medulla columns  and each medulla column is innervated by multiple MeTu1 neurons ."
"MeTu1 neurons receive the strongest input from Dm2 neurons covering the entire visual field , followed by Sm16 , MeTu1 , Sm15 and Sm07 . The density of synapses drops at a distance of 20 to 30 μm from the medulla centroid of a MeTu1 neuron . The functional implication of recurrent connections between MeTu1 neurons in the medulla remains to be examined."
"The orientation of the MeTu1 dendritic span, when fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, tends to be vertical. We observe that, near the anterior and posterior edges, the dendritic spans of MeTu neurons narrow , but future studies are required to ascertain whether this change has functional implications. MeTu1 neurons project axons to the AOTUsu_PL, where they synapse with TuBu08 neurons , among other connections ."
"The connection from MeTu1 neurons to TuBu08 neurons is retinotopic; the more anteriorly or posteriorly MeTu1 dendrites are located in the medulla, the more ventrally or dorsally they project in the AOTUsu_PL, respectively . In other words, each TuBu08 neuron receives input from a group of MeTu1 neurons at a particular azimuth, regardless of their elevation in the medulla. Such one-dimensional mapping provides a potential anatomical basis for the selectivity of TuBu08 neurons to vertical bars or to the azimuthal location of visual stimuli, but not to elevation , an anatomical structure similar to the classic Hubel & Wiesel model of how simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus48."
"MeTu2 subtypes process polarized light Many insects navigate relying on skylight polarization18,20,22,49. In Drosophila, ER4m neurons are the prominent ER neurons that process skylight polarization11,16. MeTu2 neurons , previously designated as MeTu-DRA37 are notable as the only upstream inputs of these ER neurons16 ."
"They are clustered in the dorsal half of the medulla, with dendrites mainly tiling the dorsal rim area  , where neurons process skylight polarization11,35,50. Our clustering analysis identified two MeTu2 subtypes  with distinct ramifications in the medulla and notably distinct connectivity patterns in the AOTUsu_ PC , which we named MeTu2a  and MeTu2b . Both subtypes exhibit generally vertical arborizations and similar dendritic spans , but the interconnectivity between MeTu2b in the medulla is much stronger than that between MeTu2a ."
"Furthermore, MeTu2b neurons appear to receive more input from MeTu2a than they provide input to MeTu2a. Finally, although both MeTu2 subtypes mainly stratify within medulla layer 7 , MeTu2a neurons are postsynaptic to polarization-sensitive R7 neurons only in the DRA and local interneurons DmDRA1, both of which are potentially sensitive to light polarization as well37, whereas MeTu2b inputs also include Mi15, the function of which remains unknown, and a stronger connection from interhemispheric MeMeDRA37 . Hence, MeTu2b might integrate additional inputs from the contralateral hemisphere, enabling the processing of a more global skylight polarization pattern."
"MeTu2 innervation of the AOTUsu respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1 . Also, as in the medulla, MeTu2b neurons are more strongly interconnected in the AOTUsu than are MeTu2a neurons . Moreover, although MeTu2a and MeTu2b both synapse onto TuBu01 and TuBu06, MeTu2b is only weakly connected to TuBu01 ."
"Finally, MeTu2a and MeTu2b differ in their connections to the bilateral neurons TuTuB_a and TuTuB_b . Overall, these connectivity differences in the AOTUsu_PC, combined with their distinct anatomical features in the medulla, indicate that MeTu2a and MeTu2b are likely to convey distinct features of skylight polarization to downstream circuits, with MeTu2b processing potentially more complex and global polarization patterns. MeTu3 neurons comprise three subtypes The Drosophila compass neurons can use the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding world to compute the head direction7, but the source of this information was unclear."
"Here, we provide evidence that MeTu3  and its downstream neurons process, in addition to skylight polarization , the two-dimensional organization of the scene . Our connectivity analysis identified three distinct MeTu3 subtypes  with regionalized clusters of dendrites . MeTu3a  has dendrites that cluster in the dorsal third of the medulla , are confined to layer 7  and specifically lack vertical protrusions across medulla layers ."
"MeTu3a is the only MeTu3 subtype that receives polarization information through input from DmDRA1, similar to MeTu2a and MeTu2b. MeTu3b cells  have dendrites that are clustered most densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend to the ventral two-thirds, with pronounced vertical protrusions that cover layers 5, 6 and 7 . They receive direct inhibitory input from ultraviolet -sensitive R7 photoreceptors and indirect input from blue/green-sensitive R8 cells37 through Mi15, which suggests that they have a role in processing chromatic information ."
"MeTu3c cells  have dendrites that are more ventral than those of MeTu3b, covering the equator and some of the ventral part of the medulla . Dendritic processes innervate the same layers  as MeTu3b and receive the same direct and indirect photoreceptor inputs , suggesting similar chromatic coding to that of MeTu3b. MeTu3 innervation of the AOTUsu_A respects the same topographic rules as those described for MeTu1 and MeTu2 ."
"Axons of MeTu3a, MeTu3b and MeTu3c are not well segregated in the AOTUsu_A, despite the downstream TuBu neurons  having well-segregated dendrites16 . Consequently, some MeTu3 neurons are connected to two TuBu types . All three MeTu3 subtypes are strongly and reciprocally connected to bilateral TuTuB_a neurons ."
"Because the TuTuB_a neurotransmitter is predicted to be inhibitory51 , MeTu3 neurons might exhibit strong bilateral inhibitory interactions across the entire visual field. MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons are mainly connected to TuBu07, upstream of ER3w_ab. This convergence of MeTu3a and MeTu3b suggests that ER3w_ab encodes a combination of skylight polarization and chromatic information of the sky."
"On the other hand, MeTu3c neurons are mostly presynaptic to both TuBu09 and TuBu10 . Notably, TuBu09 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more dorsally in the medulla, whereas TuBu10 neurons receive input from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located more ventrally in the medulla . Thus, the neurons downstream of MeTu3c can encode the elevation of visual stimuli  or a two-dimensional organization of visual objects in a surrounding scene."
"This capability is unique among all MeTu neurons. MeTu4 subtypes transmit widefield inputs Compass neurons receive diverse input from ER neurons, some of which exhibit responses to the contralateral visual field and self-generated motion signals12,39. Considering that these ER neurons, the dendrites of which are in the inferior bulb, are downstream of MeTu4 neurons  that originate in the ipsilateral optic lobe, their response pattern was puzzling."
"Our analyses show that MeTu4 neurons receive inputs from distinct parts of the visual world , with virtually no input from a columnar medulla cell type. Instead, they receive input mostly from large interneurons that span many medulla columns  and from others that potentially convey motor information from a neuropil called the superior posterior slope  to the medulla . These unique properties of MeTu4 might explain the mysterious properties of ER neurons in the inferior bulb12,39."
"On the basis of the connectivity in the medulla and the AOTUsu_M, we categorized MeTu4 into four subgroups: MeTu4a, MeTu4b, MeTu4c and MeTu4d . The dendrites of MeTu4a cells  cluster densely in the dorsal half of the medulla but also extend ventrally , with unique arborization in two medulla layers . Despite their dorsal location, they form no synaptic connections with polarized light-sensitive photoreceptors or DRA neurons."
"MeTu4b neurons  are notable for their unique dendritic arrangement: they span a rather small area in the equator, mostly in the posterior– medial part of the medulla that represents the frontal central visual field . The function of this spatial restriction remains unknown . MeTu4c neurons  span the entire dorsal half of the medulla , whereas MeTu4d neurons  cluster exclusively in the ventral half of the medulla  and are ideally positioned to detect features in the ventral visual field."
"Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d receive nearly identical input from a wide variety of interneurons, including those that convey information from other brain areas, such as the SPS . Like all other MeTu types, axonal projections of all MeTu4 neurons maintain anterior–posterior retinotopy in the AOTUsu_M along the ventral–dorsal axis , in contrast to what was found in a previous report14. MeTu4a, MeTu4b and MeTu4c also have presynaptic connections in the lobula , but these connections do not contribute to the AVP and were thus excluded from further analyses."
"In the AOTUsu_M, all MeTu4a neurons are presynaptic to TuBu03; some are also presynaptic to TuBu04 . MeTu4b neurons are presynaptic to TuBu02 neurons. Both MeTu4c and MeTu4d subtypes are mainly presynaptic to TuBu05 , but MeTu4d also makes presynaptic connections with TuBu02."
"MeTu4b and MeTu4c receive the main interhemispheric connections within the AOTUsu_M : MeTu4b receives strong input from AOTU046 but does not provide reciprocal input into AOTU046, whereas MeTu4c is strongly and reciprocally connected to AOTU046. MeTu4d receives no input from AOTU046, and provides only weak input to AOTU046. Finally, MeTu4d receives weak input from TuTuB_a."
"Variance across hemispheres and brains We compared the AVP within17,44 and across brains16,47 . Although our analyses are limited, owing to the lack of optic lobes in the hemibrain dataset and a single optic lobe in the male brain dataset, tentative comparisons are still possible for most MeTu types, on the basis of synapses in the AOTU  or optic lobe synapse and cell shapes . The number of neurons of each type was very similar across hemispheres of the same brain , compared to the difference across brains."
"Notably, across brains, only a few cell types showed clear differences in spatial arborization patterns, numbers or, in very few cases, perhaps even their existence . For example, MeTu4b neurons in FAFB  and the male brain optic lobe both have similar spatially restricted arborizations in the medulla, but the FAFB pattern lacks a few cells  that are present in the male optic lobe MeTu4b population. Also, the overall number of MeTu4 cells in the male brain dataset is higher and two other MeTu4 subtypes  are identified."
"Careful comparison suggests that MeTu4e in the male optic lobe could be a subset of MeTu4a in FAFB . The source of such variations across brains remains incompletely understood but is likely to be, at least in part, developmental in nature52. Extracting visual features along the AVP A common pattern across all AVP channels is the convergence of MeTu neurons onto a considerably smaller number of TuBu neurons ."
"In this transformation, each TuBu neuron integrates information from a large area of the visual field, suggesting spatial feature processing with a lower resolution. TuBu neurons also receive strong input from the contralateral visual field through TuTu neurons . Note that individual MeTu neurons sample the visual area differently depending on their location in the medulla over the anterior–posterior axis."
This results in synapse counts and dendritic field shapes differing by their locations in the medulla along this axis . The effect of this pattern on TuBu integration is not understood at present. The next step in processing—from TuBu to ER neurons—exhibits a re-expansion in the number of neuronal types .
"The ratio of connections from TuBu to ER neurons  varies between 0. 33 and, for some neurons, 4 . Thus, the transformation from TuBu to ER may extract several more visual features."
"Putative receptive fields of ER neurons To quantify the putative visual area to which each neuron probably responds, we mapped each medulla column  to a micro-computed tomography -based eye map of D. melanogaster 53 . Then, for each ER neuron, we back-traced the upstream connections in two ways: one followed TuBu to MeTu connections  and the other followed TuBu to TuTu to ipsi- and contralateral MeTu connections ."
"We used the dendritic arborization in the medulla for each pathway to estimate the area of a direct pathway or an indirect pathway. We overlaid them into a single putative receptive field , which we further analysed to obtain the outline of the visual field of the direct pathway. We then combined outlines of the same type of ER neurons to illustrate the visual area that the population of ER neurons covers ."
"Note that the lack of functional data for most optic lobe cell types, including Sm neurons, hinders extensive functional predictions. Thus, our predictions are based mainly on the dendritic fields of MeTu neurons and the known properties of presynaptic neurons. Back-tracing the synaptic pathway starting from an ER4d revealed that its upstream MeTu1 neurons are aligned vertically in the medulla ."
"They cover about 40° azimuth and the entire vertical span . This vertical arrangement of MeTu1 neurons was consistent across ER4d neurons and covered the entire visual field as a population, like an array of vertical bars . It suggests that ER4d neurons are selective to vertically elongated visual stimuli or to the location of visual stimuli along the horizontal plane, regardless of the elevation."
"Such a pathway would be best suited for detecting visual landmarks that are appropriate references for setting a heading. By contrast, back-tracing starting from single ER2_ad and ER2_b neurons revealed that they receive information from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites located in the dorsal medulla , whereas individual ER2_c neurons receive inputs exclusively from MeTu3c neurons with dendrites in the central medulla . Similar to the channel converging into ER4d neurons, the MeTu3c populations upstream of ER2_ad, ER2_b and ER2_c neurons tile the entire visual field."
"In other words, the ER2 population tiles the visual field two-dimensionally, providing more organizational details of the scene in two dimensions than do ER4d neurons . Furthermore, the roles of ER4d and ER2 in processing chromatic information might differ: Dm2, the main upstream input of MeTu1, receives inputs predominantly from UV-sensitive pale photoreceptors37 , which suggests that ER4d neurons could process UV stimuli. On the other hand, Mi15, the main upstream input of MeTu3c, receives input from green-sensitive yellow R8 photoreceptors37 , which suggests that ER2 neurons process longer-wavelength stimuli."
"Unlike the ER4d and ER2 populations, ER4m and ER5 neurons receive strong input from polarization-sensitive channels involving the DRA-specific MeTu2a  and MeTu2b  neurons, respectively. As described before, MeTu2b exhibits more complex connectivity than MeTu2a and, therefore, might encode complex features of polarized light. Hence, ER5 might process more complex features of polarized skylight, whereas ER4m seems to process skylight polarization alone as a navigational cue, consistent with a previous report11."
"This difference is notable because ER5 is involved in circadian rhythms54,55. ER3w receives input from MeTu3a and MeTu3b neurons, potentially combining skylight polarization information  and localized visual feature information from some of the dorsal visual field . On the other hand, most other ER3 subtypes with dendrites in the inferior bulb are downstream of MeTu4 subtypes that do not receive columnar input in the medulla."
"Thus, until the functions of upstream neurons  are understood, the visual area and features that these ER3 neurons encode will remain unclear. Overall, we predict that ER neurons downstream of MeTu1–MeTu3 neurons encode diverse information including polarized light , vertical stimuli or the azimuthal location of visual features , and the two-dimensional organization of visual scenes, including azimuth and elevation , a system suitable for processing both the elevation of a celestial body 56 and the surrounding two-dimensional environment7. Physiologically testing predictions We performed two-photon calcium imaging to test some of these predictions, especially the spatial extent of the visual field to which ER4d and ER2 neurons respond ."
"We imaged the dendritic calcium activity of ER neurons in the superior bulb while presenting square-shaped dot stimuli to the fly using a projector-based visual stimulation set-up . Both ER neuron types were excited by ipsilateral visual stimuli, consistent with previous studies6,9,12,39 . The ellipse contours of the receptive fields of ER4d and ER2 tile the visual space differently ."
"As predicted by our connectomic analysis, the receptive fields of ER4d neurons are vertically elongated  in height and 31 ± 12° in width), and tile the visual space horizontally. The receptive fields of ER2 neurons, on the other hand, are markedly smaller  and tile the visual space in two dimensions. These results precisely match our predictions about the spatial extent of these neurons’ receptive fields."
"Note that the vertical extent of the ER4d receptive fields is much greater than that reported previously6; we believe this to be because of the limited span of elevation in the set-up used previously. By contrast, we tilted the fly head to expose the eyes to more vertical visual span. These results show that informed, systematic predictions can guide experimental designs to reveal previously unexplored dimensions of neural functions."
"Discussion We observed four essential organization principles of the AVP:  a convergence of spatial information from MeTu to TuBu, which suggests the compression of visual information into features with coarse spatial resolution;  segregated and parallel processing of spatially overlapping visual features in largely feedforward circuits;  parallel pathways for interhemispheric integration, selectively mixing visual features; and  divergent feature expansion through TuBu-to-ER connections . Furthermore, by back-tracing from ER neurons to MeTu neurons, we inferred the diverse visual features that compass neurons might use to compute the head direction . Our analysis of the reconstructed synaptic pathways reveals that the fly’s visual field can be roughly subdivided into three regions: a narrow band in the dorsal-most visual field 11,35,50; the remaining upper visual field ; and the rest of the visual field ."
"Of note, the DRA and upper visual fields are occupied by the large majority of MeTu neuron types with overlapping receptive fields ; by contrast, the lower and frontal visual fields are served by lower numbers of cells and subtypes . In particular, MeTu4d neurons cover only the ventral half of the visual field. We speculate that this serves to process ventral optic flow57 or to orient towards shiny surfaces  that produce horizontally polarized reflections49,58, which flies detect and use to adjust their body orientation59,60."
"Nine out of the ten parallel information channels formed by MeTu neurons seem to maintain only azimuth information, discarding information about elevation; this strategy seems particularly efficient for computing a heading in azimuth. Only the MeTu3c channel may encode both azimuth and elevation—a property that seems ideal for perceiving the two-dimensional organization of the surrounding environment or for tracking the position of the celestial body across the day. Overall, these organizational patterns of the AVP suggest that D."
"melanogaster prioritizes the azimuthal position of celestial cues, including the skylight polarization pattern. Animals exhibit specific cue preferences during navigation, and we have long known that visual features are processed hierarchically16: Dung beetles prioritize skylight polarization or sun location depending on the environmental context1, and mammals prioritize the geometry of the surrounding space2,3. However, the field is only just beginning to investigate which visual features are extracted and how they are prioritized across insects4,43 and mammals2."
"As such, our complete reconstruction of the AVP in flies is essential for mechanistically understanding the circuit implementation and shared functional principles that underlie the prioritization, integration and transformation of this information into a heading signal. This is exemplified by our experiments that physiologically confirm some of the new predictions. Furthermore, with the ability to dissect detailed circuit dynamics of neural populations using the rich genetic tools in flies, we are poised to gain a deeper understanding of how sensory information is transformed into more abstract representations, which is fundamental to and essential for higher cognitive functions in the brain."
"Walking is a complex motor programme involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting1–6, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear."
"Here, using connectomeinformed models7–9 and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism  relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism  relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning."
"The brake neurons, by constrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Walking recruits distributed neural activity across the brain6,10–12 and spinal cord13,14 or nerve cord15,16."
"When an animal halts, the net output of this distributed neural activity notably changes to arrest leg stepping movements. Moreover, depending on the behavioural context, animals halt in different context-appropriate ways. Whereas a few specific neuronal types driving halting have been recently described1,2,4–6,17,18, how walking-related neural activity changes to allow halting in a manner that is both mechanically stable and appropriate to the behavioural context is at present unclear."
"Identification of halt neurons To identify neurons involved in halting in Drosophila, we optogenetically activated specific neurons that innervate the suboesophageal zone  of the fly brain19,20, a region that houses the neurons close to and including the descending output of the brain21 . Through this neural-activation screen , we identified 11 genetic drivers that were both relatively sparse and caused halting without gross motor deficits . Among these lines, we could unambiguously pinpoint three causal neurons for halting, which we refer to as Foxglove , Bluebell  and Brake  ."
"We identified split-Gal4 reagents that targeted FG, BB and BRK with little to no ectopic expression and drove robust halting as reflected by decrease in walking velocity, distance and rotation . Using connectome parsing tools23–26 , we identified these neurons in the brain8,9 and nerve-cord27–29 connectomes . Both FG and BB  are SEZ neurons that stochastically descend until the anterior tip of the nerve cord."
The FG line has weak ectopic expression in the mushroom body neuropil that does not contribute to the halting phenotype . The BB line also labels  an additional neuron previously described as ‘bluebird’20 . BRK is a new neuronal type discovered in this work and drives the strongest halting phenotype .
"BRK comprises six ascending neurons with their somata in each of the six leg-segment-specific neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord  and axonal projections to the brain SEZ region . By activating subsets of BRK neurons, we found that activating any of the BRK neurons is sufficient to drive halting . Consistent with this, in the connectome, we found that although each BRK gets distinct inputs, all the six BRK share common major outputs in their two output zones, the tectulum30 of the VNC and the SEZ of the brain ."
"Analysis of walking velocities on FG, BB or BRK stimulation  hinted at potential differences in the halting phenotypes. To precisely quantify such differences, we performed, high-resolution three-dimensional  leg kinematics analysis . BRK drove low-latency, long-duration halting bouts  with joint angles locked in a specific position for the entire halt duration ."
"By contrast, FG and BB induced halts were interspersed with leg movements. FG drove long halting bouts like BRK but still allowed brief repositioning of legs . BB drove stationary periods interspersed with slow walking and allowed more leg movements ."
"Unlike BRK, both FG and BB stimulated flies often took a few steps before halting . Defining the genetic drivers and connectome identities of ‘halt’ neurons driving distinct types of halting, allowed us to next address their interaction with the walking-promoting circuits. Diversity in walk–halt interactions To address if and how the newly identified halt neurons interact with walking-promoting pathways, we leveraged genetic tools targeting walking-promoting  neurons characterized in our previous work, namely P9  that drives forward turning19,21, BPN  that drives straight forward walking19 and MDN  that drives backward walking31."
"We combined split-Gal4 reagents for the walk and halt neurons and confirmed opsin expression in the desired neurons . Here, in addition to the three halt neuron driver lines, and to confirm the role of BB, we used another driver line  that targets FG + BB without any ectopic expression. Using these tools, we performed all possible combinations of ‘walk + halt’ coactivations."
"BRK stimulation completely suppressed all walking commands , suggesting that it drives a dominant halting mechanism . By contrast, FG and BB activation affected the walk neuron phenotypes with varying degrees and specificity, suggesting distinct halting mechanisms being deployed in these cases. During coactivation with MDN, unlike BRK, FG and BB did not suppress backward walking ."
"However, the intermittent switches to forward walking observed during continuous MDN stimulation  were absent  or markedly reduced  as seen in the individual trial velocity traces . This suggests that FG and BB predominantly suppress forward walking. Consistent with this, when FG or BB were coactivated with P9, the flies showed a marked reduction in forward velocity ."
"BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 coactivated flies also showed a corresponding decrease in angular velocity compared to P9-stimulated flies . However, FG + P9 coactivated flies still showed a large increase in angular velocity at stimulation onset. We found that while the BB + P9 or FG + BB + P9 flies were predominantly halting during the optogenetic stimulation, FG + P9 flies were pivoting on the spot ."
"These observations revealed an unexpected modularity in the P9 downstream pathway into two components: a forward walking component that is suppressed by both FG and BB and a turning component that is suppressed by BB. As the FG + BB line  has a similar phenotype as the BB line , we conclude that BB and not bluebird is responsible for the forward turning suppression. When FG or BB was coactivated with BPN, the flies still increased forward walking during optogenetic stimulation ."
"Whereas this increase in forward walking tended to be smaller than that of activation of BPN alone, only in the case of FG could we see a statistically significant difference in the distance quantification . Although BPN + FG + BB coactivated flies decreased forward walking it was interspersed with intermittent jumps possibly due to ectopic expression in the VNC  rendering the distance quantification unreliable . On the basis of these results, we conclude that FG can partially suppress the BPN driven forward walking."
"To summarize, we found that  BRK suppresses all walking commands,  FG specifically suppresses forward walking components of P9 and BPN  and  BB predominantly suppresses forward turning induced by P9. The diversity in these walk–halt interactions suggests that the neural targets and mechanisms deployed by the three halting pathways  are at least partially distinct. The walk-OFF mechanism Guided by the whole fly brain connectome and the FlyWire toolkit26, we asked if and where the halting and walking pathways might converge."
"We identified, annotated and proofread all the walk and halt neuronal types and their downstream partners in the connectome8,9 . We found no direct connections between the walk and halt neurons. However, all the walk and halt neurons share a common output zone, the SEZ, where they could converge on same output neurons."
"Even though MDN and P9 are descending neurons  that project from the brain to the VNC, they have collaterals in the SEZ through which they recruit other neurons including DNs. Decapitated MDN flies, in which these SEZ collaterals are eliminated, show backward walking on optogenetic stimulation32 indicating that the VNC circuit recruited by MDNs is sufficient for driving the phenotype. However, decapitated P9-activated flies do not show the phenotypic forward turning ."
"This implies that the other DNs recruited by P9 SEZ collaterals  are critical for the phenotype. Indeed, some P9 downstream DNs  were previously implicated in turning15,33,34. BPN is a higher brain neuron19 that directly recruits other DNs through SEZ outputs."
"We therefore focused on identifying whether halting pathway projections to the SEZ impinge on DNs recruited by P9 and BPN. To comprehensively analyse interaction between halting and walking pathways, we used a connectome-constrained whole-brain spiking-network model to reproduce the behavioural coactivation experiments in silico. The model , uses the entire connectivity matrix from the FlyWire data8, and assigns positive or negative weight to the connection based on synapse number and predicted neurotransmitter35."
"We validated the neurotransmitter predictions for the halt neurons and confirmed that FG and BB are γ-aminobutyric acid ergic  neurons, whereas BRK is an excitatory  neuronal type . Comparing responses across top 100 responding neurons in each in silico coactivation experiment  show that all three halt neurons inhibit different, partially overlapping subsets of neurons recruited by the walk pathways. Although the P9 pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by BB, the BPN pathway is more broadly and strongly inhibited by FG ."
"This aligns with the corresponding behavioural phenotypes . We next focused on DNs strongly recruited by the walk pathways and generated synapse-weighted graphs to simultaneously visualize the connectivity and predicted firing rate . In the case of P9 coactivation with halt neurons, BB suppressed the firing rate of most of the DNs whereas FG specifically inhibited a single DN named oDN1 ."
"The BB result is consistent with the complete suppression of P9 phenotype in behavioural experiments . Given that FG only suppressed the forward walking component of P9 phenotype , we infer that oDN1 is mainly relevant for driving forward velocity but not rotational velocity. In the case of DNs recruited by BPN, neither FG nor BB inhibits the whole population ."
"This could explain why we never saw a complete suppression of walking in corresponding behavioural experiments . To probe why FG has a stronger effect in behavioural experiments, we compared the neurons that are differentially affected by FG versus BB. BDN2 stood apart as a DN specifically and strongly inhibited by FG ."
"Taken together, the modelling and behavioural data show that FG and BB are positioned to directly inhibit critical nodes in the P9 and BPN walking-promotion pathways and decrease forward and/or rotational walking velocity. We term this the walk-OFF mechanism. Furthermore, oDN1 and BDN2  stood apart as important nodes to mediate differences in BB and FG effects on the walking pathways ."
"We therefore generated split-Gal4 drivers  to specifically target these neurons. Optogenetically activating oDN1 and BDN2 drove walking initiation, with BDN2 showing a much stronger phenotype . Even decapitated oDN1 and BDN2 activated flies initiated robust forward walking  suggesting that unlike P9, the VNC outputs of these DNs are sufficient for forward walking."
"However, on optogenetic silencing, only BDN2-silenced flies showed a reduction in forward velocity . This suggests that BDN2 might be critical during spontaneous walking, whereas oDN1 could be redundant or recruited only in specific contexts. Indeed, on in vivo imaging, we found that BDN2 activity is strongly correlated to forward  velocity of the fly ."
"Given that BDN2 is strongly inhibited by FG and not by BB , this could explain why FG drives stronger halting in spontaneously walking flies . In silico coactivating BRK ascending projections, along with P9  and BPN  showed that while BRK is excitatory, it recruits other predicted inhibitory neurons in the SEZ to suppress walking-promotion DNs. When coactivated with P9, BRK inhibits many of the critical walking-promotion DNs, including oDN1."
"However, when coactivated with BPN, BRK inhibits only a subset of DNs, with BDN2 being weakly inhibited. This is in contrast to the strong walking suppression observed in the corresponding behavioural experiments . Crucially, BRK activation suppressed backward walking driven by MDN, whose descending output in the VNC is sufficient to drive backward walking ."
"This suggests that, in addition to inhibiting some walking-promoting pathways in the brain , BRK probably acts in the VNC to drive halting. The ‘brake’ mechanism The stepping cycle consists of a swing phase  and stance phase . Given the strong ‘freezing-like’, BRK phenotype , we wondered whether BRK could cause the legs to ‘freeze’ at any point during a stepping cycle similar to a recent report in mice2."
"We found that in case of BRK mid-swing stimulation, the leg finishes the swing phase in an unaltered manner, but freezes as soon as it lands on the ground  when the femur–tibia  joint is in an extended position . Indeed, in these cases, swing duration is not altered when compared to prestimulus swing duration . However, for BRK mid-stance stimulation, the leg stays locked in place at the onset of the stimulation  leading to a broad Fe–Ti joint distribution across flies and trials ."
"This is in contrast to FG stimulation in which the leg always assumes a relaxed stance position, regardless of when the optogenetic stimulus started . A similar result was obtained for other leg joints, suggesting it is not a Fe–Ti joint-specific phenomenon . This locking of joints during stance phase shows that the BRK phenotype is probably due to an active mechanism."
We proposed that this could be driven by BRK VNC outputs upregulating the postural resistance reflex to lock the leg joints. The term ‘resistance reflex’ is used to describe postural reflexes in all legged animals that allow maintenance of posture while in a stationary state36. Upregulating such reflexes could lead to locking of leg joints while in stance phase as seen on BRK stimulation.
"To test this hypothesis, we activated either MDN or MDN + BRK in decapitated flies and analysed their leg kinematics. As reported earlier32, decapitated flies showed backward walking on MDN activation. However, decapitated MDN + BRK stimulated flies remained stationary ."
"This confirms that a VNC-specific circuit is recruited by BRK to arrest leg movements. During backward walking, the Fe–Ti joint of the front leg is extended before a swing is initiated . We therefore refer to Fe–Ti angles above 107°  as the ‘swing initiation zone’ ."
"On MDN + BRK stimulation, the Fe–Ti angle remained locked in place, and in most cases never reached the SIZ . In the few cases when it reached the SIZ , this rarely led to levation of the leg. The leg, despite being in an extended Fe–Ti position still remained firmly perched on the substrate as indicated by increased dwell time in SIZ  and decreased swing events in SIZ ."
"We performed a complementary analysis for forward walking while activating BDN2 or BDN2 + BRK in decapitated flies. In contrast to backward walking, during forward walking the SIZ for front-leg Fe–Ti lies in flexed angle values . Despite this difference, coactivation with BRK interrupted forward walking  in a similar manner to that seen for backward walking ."
"Taken together, this showed that BRK activation led the flies to resist both flexion and extension at the Fe–Ti joint. Resisting such movements, would require actively engaging specific leg muscles. We, therefore activated BRK and monitored front-leg femoral muscle activity with the Fe–Ti joint restrained in a flexed or extended position ."
"In a flexed Fe–Ti position, activating BRK recruited accessory flexor-a and extensor. However, in an extended Fe–Ti position, BRK stimulation recruited accessory flexor-a and accessory flexor-b . Based on the literature37,38, we inferred that accessory flexor-a corresponds to the muscles innervated by slow motor neurons  and is also implicated in maintaining joint position38,39."
"The position of accessory flexor-b indicates they are probably innervated by intermediate and/or fast flexor motor neurons that drive flexion movement that would resist forced extension. Extensors on the other hand, drive Fe–Ti extension and would therefore resist forced flexion. Thus, the muscle activity profile driven by BRK resembles a resistance-like state in each Fe–Ti position."
"Even in cases when there was spontaneous, prestimulus muscle activity, BRK drove a concerted change including inhibition of highly active muscles and activation of specific muscles to reach this same resistance state-like activity profile . To confirm this represents a resistance reflex-like activity, we passively flexed or extended the Fe–Ti joint and induced resistance reflex while monitoring muscle activity . Here, both control flies and BRK stimulated flies resisted these passive movements and showed a similar recruitment of muscles to that described above, with BRK stimulated flies showing a more robust response ."
"Taken together, this suggests that BRK drives a resistance-like state in the femoral muscles. FG or BB activation did not induce any robust muscle activity in similar experiments . Only in cases where there was prestimulus spontaneous muscle activity did FG lead to gradual inhibition of this activity ."
"We reasoned this could be because FG inhibits DNs driving the prestimulus spontaneous activity. Combining the kinematics and muscle-imaging results, we conclude that BRK drives a stance phase-specific resistance state at the leg joints by means of a VNC-specific neural circuit. FG and BB are required during foraging We next addressed if and when the animals use the FG, BB and BRK halting pathways."
"Mining the connectome for inputs to the halting neurons revealed that FG and BB are downstream to the sugar sensory pathway, and directly connected to Fdg neurons previously shown to drive halting and proboscis extension for feeding40,41 . We therefore activated sugar gustatory receptor neurons  both in silico and in vivo. In both cases, FG was strongly recruited whereas BB showed weak and variable activity."
". Moreover, in vivo, FG showed stronger responses in starved flies compared to fed flies , whereas BB only responded  in starved flies . These state-dependent responses could be driven by differences in the feeding drive due to hunger signals impinging on the sugar sensory pathway41."
"To understand how different feeding and walking drives might converge on the previously implicated walking-promotion nodes , we coactivated sugar GRNs with either P9 or BPN walk neurons at varying activity levels, and monitored oDN1 and BDN2 firing rates, respectively. Both oDN1 and BDN2 were tightly regulated as a function of walking and feeding pathway stimulation, showing that there is an excitation–inhibition balance at these nodes . To test whether FG is critical for relaying the inhibition from sugar GRNs to the walking nodes, we repeated the above simulation, but while silencing FG in the model."
"This clearly shifted the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking nodes, such that we could now see release of inhibition on oDN1 and BDN2 when compared to the results in the FG intact model . This suggests that FG may be relevant for halting in the context of foraging and feeding. Because BB is only weakly recruited in our model, we did not see big changes at BDN2 or oDN1 when we repeated the simulation with BB silenced ."
"To confirm the role of halt neurons during feeding, we optogenetically silenced these neurons, while providing starved flies with a choice between blank substrate  versus sucrose substrate . Control flies or flies with BRK or BB silenced spent most of their time on the sucrose side, whereas FG silenced flies were unable to preferentially stay on the sucrose side , confirming the importance of FG for stopping on sugar detection. At the start of this assay, flies were randomly distributed on the sucrose and blank side making it difficult to analyse locomotor changes when the fly first encountered the sucrose."
"To analyse these first encounters, we quantified interaction of flies with a small food-blob, placed at the centre of a large circular arena . All flies slowed down when they first encountered the food-blob, probably because, unlike the previous assay, here they could detect the food-blob by textural changes and consume it. However, FG- and BB-silenced flies showed shorter stopping bouts and increased velocities near the blob compared to controls ."
"Specifically, BB-silenced flies were indistinguishable from controls before food encounter, but showed prolonged increase in both translational and angular velocities after food encounter . This could show a potential role for BB in constraining forward and angular velocities during foraging-type behaviours that involve a local search following food encounter43,44. Such post food-encounter behavioural state transitions have been well described in flies43,44."
"However, these are not accounted for in our computational model, or in the functional imaging experiments . This could explain the weaker BB responses observed on in vivo or in silico sugar-GRN stimulation. Taken together, this confirms that FG and BB are recruited for halting and locomotor control in the context of feeding and foraging."
"Notably, connectomics revealed that this halting pathway diverges from the previously described proboscis extension pathway7,41 . In agreement with this, FG or BB silencing had no effect on the proboscis extension response  when tethered flies were presented with sucrose . BRK is required during grooming To understand when flies recruit BRK neurons, we monitored in vivo BRK activity in spontaneous walking and halting flies ."
We imaged a region of the VNC that permits identification of the axons belonging to each of the six BRK neurons . We noticed that BRK is recruited only during a subset of halting events. By annotating synchronously recorded behaviour we found that BRK activity correlated with either ‘ball-pushing’ or ‘grooming’ events .
"As ball-pushing is probably a special behaviour that only happens in a tethered fly walking on an air-supported ball, we focused on the grooming events. BRK activity correlated in a segment-specific manner to the respective grooming events . Most prominent among these were front-leg rubs and hind-leg rubs that coincided with large correlated activity bumps in front and hind BRK, respectively ."
"Aligning BRK activity profile across multiple flies and grooming events, showed that the segment-specific BRK activity starts ramping up before the grooming event and synchronized with a coincident dip in walking velocity . Fittingly, in the connectome, we found that DNg12, a command neuron that drives head-grooming with front legs45 provides most input to front BRK , whereas wPN1, a command neuron that drives wing grooming with hind legs46 provides most input to hind BRK . We also identified potential leg-grooming sensory-motor pathways from each leg to corresponding segment BRK neurons ."
"Thus, BRK neurons receive distinct segment-specific grooming command inputs. However, all BRK share common outputs  that lead to halting with upregulation of postural reflexes . What could be the role of the BRK outputs during grooming?"
"During grooming, flies halt and lift a subset of legs  while supporting their body weight on the remaining stationary legs. We wondered whether BRK was necessary for both halting and stability during grooming. We therefore optogenetically silenced BRK in flies that were induced to groom by powdering them47,48."
"BRK silencing did not abolish grooming, but led to interruption of continuous grooming by intermittent walking events  confirming BRK’s role for halting during grooming. Control flies or flies with FG or BB silenced showed prolonged uninterrupted grooming . Moreover, we found that BRK silenced flies become destabilized during grooming ."
"To address if this destabilization was due to the VNC outputs of BRK, we repeated this experiment in decapitated flies. Consistent with the literature48, control decapitated flies showed robust grooming when covered with powder. Because decapitated flies do not have an inherent forward walking drive like intact flies, it was unsurprising that we did not see any walking on BRK silencing."
"However, we saw that powdered, decapitated BRK silenced flies often lost their balance and tripped while grooming, confirming BRK’s role in stabilization during grooming . On the basis of the above observations, and given that BRK output only affects legs in stance, we proposed that BRK is recruited by segment-specific grooming commands to halt and stabilize the posture of the stationary  legs used for balancing the body weight. For instance, during front grooming, command neurons  would recruit the front BRKs that in turn stabilize mid and hind legs , whereas during hind grooming, the corresponding grooming commands  would recruit hind-BRKs that in turn stabilize the front and mid-legs ."
"To test this segment-specific role of BRK, we designed an assay in which we silenced BRK subsets, while inducing segment-specific grooming. We generated split-Gal4 lines that targeted front BRK , front + mid-BRK  or front + hind BRK , and confirmed that activating these BRK subsets drives halting in all cases . Next, we optogenetically silenced these BRK subsets and induced front or hind grooming using a powdered brush in tethered decapitated flies placed on an air-supported ball ."
"We performed leg kinematics analysis of front and hind legs . As expected, control flies were stable during the grooming events as indicated by low ball movement and low Fe–Ti movement of the non-grooming legs . Conversely, when front-BRK silenced flies were induced to perform front grooming, they were destabilized as shown by increased ball movement  and hind-leg movements ."
"However, if flies with silenced front BRK but intact hind BRK , were induced to perform hind grooming, they showed control-like behaviour and groomed hind legs while stabilizing the front legs . On the other hand, flies with hind BRK silenced , were destabilized during hind grooming bouts . Taken together, this shows that BRK is recruited in a segment-specific manner for halting and stability in the context of grooming."
"We thus explain distinct contexts in which each halting pathway is recruited. Consistent with this, activating head-bristle sensory projections  in the brain connectome model, drove strong activity in DNg12s  but not in FG or BB, whereas activating sugar GRNs  recruited FG and BB but not DNg12s  . Connectomics predicts halt neurons Having identified the critical nodes in the walking pathways that are targeted by halt neurons, we aimed to gain insight into other halting pathways that could be relevant in other contexts."
"Although we could not identify some previously described slowing4 or halting5 neurons in the connectome, we could locate two neurons that were implicated indirectly in promoting halting, namely MAN  and oviDN . In similar simulations as in Fig. 3, both MAN and oviDN, through predicted GABAergic neurons , suppressed walking-promotion neurons including oDN1 and BDN2 ."
"This showed other routes in addition to FG, BB, BRK that could inhibit walking-promotion nodes. To find all such routes, we generated a list of predicted halt neurons  as those with strong inhibitory inputs to oDN1 and BDN2, most of which also inhibit other potential walking-promotion DNs . As these neurons will ultimately control the excitation–inhibition balance at the walking-promotion nodes, these could also be involved in velocity control  and not just halting."
"These predicted halt neurons receive input from different upstream neurons, and could underlie halting in other behavioural contexts . Discussion Our work explains two fundamental halting mechanisms in Drosophila. The first mechanism, categorized as the walk-OFF mechanism causes halting by inhibition of walking-promotion neurons."
"This could be compared to taking one’s foot off the gas pedal of a car, and is analogous to action-suppression mechanisms proposed in different behaviours including walking, across organisms11,51–56. In this connectomics-driven work, we could go beyond identification of this mechanism and gain major insights into the organization of the halting and walking-control circuits in flies. We found that  walking initiation neurons  recruit populations of heterogeneous DNs by means of SEZ outputs that are poised to recruit multiple downstream VNC circuits for initiating specific walking patterns,  halting and walking pathways converge at specific nodes in these DN populations  whose excitation–inhibition balance probably dictates the walking state and  different halting pathways inhibit different subsets of walking-promotion DNs."
"Specifically, turning and forward-walking-promoting DNs could be differentially inhibited by BB and FG, respectively. This shows a modularity in the descending control of turning and forward walking that is consistent with recent results from neuronal population imaging and modelling work in Drosophila12,34,57. This also aligns with modularity at the level of brainstem spinal projection neurons observed in vertebrates , indicating that vertebrates could also have halting pathways that differentially inhibit forward locomotion and turning."
"The second mechanism, categorized as the brake mechanism, drives active resistance at the leg joints in the legs that are on the ground , much like the brakes of a car resisting motion of the wheels. Also, similarly to how one releases the accelerator pedal while pressing on the brakes to avoid skidding, the newly identified BRK neurons inhibit the walking-promotion DNs through their brain outputs while simultaneously promoting resistance in the legs through their VNC outputs. The pathway from BRK to leg muscles is probably gated by proprioceptive inputs that confer the stance phase-specific behavioural response ."
"This BRK mechanism is consistent with their recruitment during grooming when the fly needs to both inhibit walking and balance its body on a subset of stationary legs. A similar mechanism could be relevant in other halting contexts in flies  or other animals for execution of halting with increased stability. Recent work in mice has uncovered a brainstem neuronal population  that drives halting with legs in stance1,59."
"However, these neurons were not shown to drive upregulation of postural reflexes as seen for BRK. Moreover, recent work shows subsets of Chx10-Gi neurons being relevant in different aspects of walking, stopping, turning or grooming18,59,60. Our results encourage the search for BRK-like mechanism in these Chx10-Gi subsets or other BRK-analogous spinal ascending pathways in vertebrates."
"Comparing across connectome-informed circuits of all verified or predicted halting pathways in this study, we isolated a generic neural circuit motif for halting. For promoting halting to allow stationary behaviours such as feeding, egg-laying or grooming, the halting pathway branches off from the behaviour-specific sensory-motor pathway and impinges on walking-promoting circuits . The halt neurons themselves need not encode for the behavioural-specific motor output  but rather drive the initiation and maintenance of a halted state during the behaviour."
"This halting branch is typically located downstream to command-like neurons in the sensory-motor circuit . This emergence of modularity downstream in the circuit could be an efficient circuit-design for targeting similar population of walking-promotion neurons in different contexts. Despite this conserved motif shared across all halting pathways, the specific targets and mechanisms deployed by the halt neurons are distinct."
"This distinction may confer the specificity to how halting versus walking decisions are executed in a context-appropriate manner. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome1 with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units ."
"Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome2, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes."
"Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics. The adult fruit fly represents the current frontier for whole-brain connectomics."
"With 139,255 neurons, the newly completed full adult female brain  connectome is intermediate in log scale between the first connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans  and the mouse , a desirable but currently intractable target5. The availability of a complete adult fly brain connectome now allows brain-spanning circuits to be mapped and linked to circuit dynamics and behaviour as has long been possible for the nematode and more recently the Drosophila larva 6. However, the adult fly has richer behaviour, including complex motor control while walking or in flight7, courtship behaviour8, involved decision making9, flexible associative memory10,11, spatial learning12 and complex13,14 multisensory15,16 navigation."
"The FlyWire brain connectome reported in our companion paper1 is by some margin the largest and most complex yet obtained. The full connectome, derived from the approximately 100 teravoxel FAFB whole-brain electron microscopy  volume17, can be represented as a graph with 139,255 nodes and around 15. 1 million weighted edges."
"Here we formulate and answer key questions that are essential to interpreting connectomes at this scale regarding  how we know which edges are important;  how we can simplify the connectome graph to aid automated or human analysis; and  the extent to which this connectome is a snapshot of a single brain or representative of this species as a whole . These questions are inextricably linked with connectome annotation and cell type identification18,19 within and across datasets. At the most basic level, navigating this connectome would be extremely challenging without a comprehensive system of annotations, which we now provide."
"Our annotations represent an indexed and hierarchical human-readable parts list18,20, enabling biologists to explore their systems and neurons of interest. Connectome annotation is also crucial to ensuring data quality as it inevitably reveals segmentation errors that must be corrected. Furthermore, there is a rich history in Drosophila of probing the circuit basis of a wide range of innate and learned behaviours as well as their developmental genetic origins; realizing the full potential of this dataset is only possible by cross-identifying cell types within the connectome with those characterized in the published and in-progress literature."
"This paper reports this key component of the connectome together with the open source tools  and resources that we have generated. As the annotation and proofreading of the connectome are inextricably linked, the companion paper1 and this paper will preferably be co-cited as they jointly describe the FlyWire resource. Comparison with cell types proposed using the partial hemibrain connectome2 confirmed that the majority of fly cell types is highly stereotyped, and defined simple rules for which connections within a connectome are reliable and therefore more likely to be functional."
"However, this comparison also revealed unexpected variability in some cell types and demonstrated that many cell types originally reported in the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. This discovery necessitated the development and application of a new robust approach for defining cell types jointly across connectomics datasets. Overall, this effort lays the foundation both for deep interrogation of current and anticipated fly connectomes from normal individuals, but also future studies of sexual dimorphism, experience-dependent plasticity, development and disease at the wholebrain scale."
"Hierarchical annotation of a connectome Annotations defining different kinds of neurons are key to exploring and interpreting any connectome; but, with the FlyWire connectome— which we report jointly with the companion paper1—now exceeding the 100,000 neuron mark, they are also both of increased significance and more challenging to generate. We defined a comprehensive, systematic and hierarchical set of annotations based on the anatomical organization of the brain , as well as the developmental origin and coarse morphology of neurons . Building on these as well as validating cell types identified from pre-existing datasets, we then defined a set of consensus terminal cell types intended to capture the finest level of organization that is reproducible across brains ."
"We first collected and curated basic metadata for every neuron in the dataset including soma position and side, and entry or exit nerve for afferent and efferent neurons, respectively . Our group also predicted neurotransmitter identity for all neurons as reported elsewhere21. We then defined a hierarchy of four levels: flow > superclass > class > cell type, which provide salient labels at different granularities ."
"The first two levels, flow and superclass, were densely annotated: every neuron is either afferent, efferent or intrinsic to the brain  and falls into one of the nine superclasses: sensory , motor , endocrine , ascending  to brain), descending , visual projection , visual centrifugal , or intrinsic to the optic lobes or the central brain . Mapping to the https://virtualflybrain. org/  database enables cross-referencing of neurons and types with other publications ."
"Note that due to an inversion of the left–right axis during the original acquisition of the FAFB dataset17, identified during preparation of this work , frontal figures in this work and the FlyWire connectome1 have the fly’s left on the viewer’s left, and the fly’s right on the viewer’s right, that is, the opposite of the usual convention. However, all side labels are biologically correct. The class field contains pre-existing neurobiological groupings from the literature  and is sparsely annotated  for the central brain, in large part because past research has favoured some brain areas over others."
"In the optic lobes, 99% of neurons have a generic class based on their neuropil innervation. Finally, 98% of all central brain neurons were given a terminal cell type, a majority of which could be linked to at least one report in the literature . Our annotations for the optic lobes include cell types for 92% of neurons in both left and right optic lobes."
"A separate report23 will describe comprehensive typing of all neurons intrinsic to the optic lobes. In total, we collected over 870,000 annotations for all 139,255 neurons; all are available for download and through neuroglancer scenes . A total of 32,388  neurons are intrinsic to the central brain and 77,536  neurons are intrinsic to the optic lobes."
"The optic lobes and the central brain are connected through 8,053 visual projection and 524 visual centrifugal neurons. The central brain receives afferent input through 5,512 sensory and 2,362 ascending neurons. Efferent output is realized through 1,303 descending, 80 endocrine and 106 motor neurons."
"We find marked stereotypy in the number of central brain intrinsic neurons—for example, between the left and the right hemisphere, they differ by only 27  neurons. For superclasses with less consistency in left versus right counts, such as the ascending neurons , the discrepancies are typically due to ambiguity in the sidedness . Combining the dense superclass annotation for all neurons with the connectome1 gives a birds-eye view of the input/output connectivity of the central brain : 55% of the central brain’s synaptic input comes from the optic system; 25% from the VNC through ascending neurons; and only 18% from peripheral sensory neurons."
"This is surprising as sensory neurons are almost as numerous as visual projection neurons ; individual visual projection neurons therefore provide about 2. 5 times more synapses, underscoring the value of this information stream. Input neurons make about two synapses onto central brain neurons for every one synapse onto output neurons."
"Most output synapses target the VNC through descending neurons ; the rest provide centrifugal feedback onto the optic system , motor neuron output  and endocrine output to the periphery . A full atlas of neuronal lineages Our top-level annotations  provide a systematic but relatively coarse grouping of neurons compared with >5,000 terminal cell types expected from previous work on the hemibrain2. We therefore developed an intermediate level of annotation based on hemilineages—this provides a powerful bridge between the developmental origin and molecular specification of neurons and their place within circuits in the connectome ."
"Central brain neurons and a minority of visual projection neurons are generated by around 120 identified neuroblasts per hemisphere. Each of these stem cells is defined by a unique transcriptional code and generates a stereotyped lineage in a precise birth order by asymmetric division24–27 . Each neuroblast typically produces two hemilineages28,29 that differ markedly in neuronal morphology and can express different neurotransmitters from one another, but neurons in each hemilineage usually express a single fast-acting transmitter21,30."
"Hemilineages therefore represent a natural functional as well as developmental grouping by which to study the nervous system. Within a hemilineage, neurons form processes that extend together in one cohesive bundle  that enters, traverses and interconnects neuropil compartments in a stereotypical pattern . Comparing these features between EM and previous light-level data31–34 enabled us to compile the first definitive atlas of all hemilineages in the central brain ."
"In total, we successfully identified 120 neuroblast lineages in FlyWire comprising 183 hemilineages for 88%  of central brain neurons . The unassigned neurons are likely primary neurons born during embryonic development, which account for 10% of neurons in the adult brain35,36. We tentatively designated 3,779  as primary neurons either based on specific identification in the literature27 or expert assessment of diagnostic morphological features such as larger cell bodies and broader projections."
"A further 797 neurons  did not co-fasciculate with any hemilineage tracts, even though their morphology suggested that they are later-born secondary neurons37. This developmental atlas is comprehensive as, after reviewing discrepancies between previous studies , we identified all 119 expected lineages plus one new lineage. The number of neurons per hemilineage can vary widely —for example, counting both hemispheres, FLAa1 contains just 30 neurons whereas MBp4  has 1,335."
"However, in general, the number of neurons per hemilineage is between 60 and 282 . Nevertheless, the numbers of neurons within each hemilineage were highly reliable, differing only by 3%  between the left and right hemispheres . This is consistent with the near-equality of neurons per hemisphere noted in Fig."
"1, and indicates great precision in the developmental programs controlling neuron number. We also identified neurons belonging to 125 hemilineages in the hemibrain dataset , a connectome comprising approximately half of a female fly brain2 . The number of neurons per hemilineage strongly correlates across brains , with FlyWire hemilineages containing on average around 5% more neurons ."
"Although hemilineages typically contain functionally and morphologically related neurons, subgroups can be observed37. We further divided each hemilineage into distinct morphology groups, each innervating similar brain regions and taking similar internal tracts, using NBLAST morphological clustering38 . This generated a total of 528 groupings that are consistent across hemispheres and provide an additional layer of annotations between the hemilineage and cell type levels."
"Validating cell types across brains We next sought to compare FlyWire against the hemibrain connectome2; this contains most of one central brain hemisphere and parts of the optic lobe. The hemibrain was previously densely cell typed by a combination of two automated procedures followed by extensive manual review2,39–41: NBLAST morphology clustering initially yielded 5,235 morphology types; multiple rounds of CBLAST connectivity clustering split some types, generating 640 connectivity types for a final total of 5,620 types. We have reidentified just 14% of connectivity types and therefore use the 5,235 morphology types as a baseline for comparison."
"Although 389  of the hemibrain cell types were previously established in the literature and recorded in the https://virtualflybrain. org/ database22, principally through analysis of genetic driver lines19, the great majority  were newly proposed using the hemibrain, that is, derived from a single hemisphere of a single animal. This was reasonable given the pioneering nature of the hemibrain reconstruction, but the availability of the FlyWire connectome now allows for a more stringent re-examination."
"We approach this by considering each cell type in the hemibrain as a prediction: if we can reidentify a distinct group of cells with the same properties in both hemispheres of the FlyWire dataset, then we conclude that a proposed hemibrain cell type has been tested and validated. To perform this validation, we first used non-rigid three-dimensional  registration to map meshes and skeletons of all hemibrain neurons into FlyWire space, enabling direct co-visualization of both datasets and a range of automated analyses. We then used NBLAST38 to calculate morphological similarity scores between all hemibrain neurons and the approximately 84,000 FlyWire neurons with arbours at least partially contained within the hemibrain volume ."
"We manually reviewed the top five NBLAST hits for a random sample of individual neuron-to-neuron matches and found that high NBLAST scores typically indicate a good morphological match . Extrapolating from this sample, we expect 99% of hemibrain neurons to have a morphologically very similar neuron in FlyWire . We next attempted to map hemibrain cell types onto FlyWire neurons."
"Candidate type matches were manually reviewed by co-visualization and only those with high confidence were accepted . Crucially, this initial morphological matching process generated a large corpus of shared cell type labels between datasets; with these in place, we developed an across-dataset connectivity clustering method that enabled us to investigate and resolve difficult cases . The majority of hemibrain cell types  were unambiguously found in the FlyWire dataset ."
"A further 664  hemibrain types were mapped but had to be either merged  or further split  . In total, 7% of proposed hemibrain types were combined to define new ‘composite’ types  because the hemibrain split could not be recapitulated when examining neurons from both FlyWire and the hemibrain . This is not too surprising as the hemibrain philosophy was explicitly to err on the side of splitting in cases of uncertainty2."
"We found that 5% of proposed hemibrain types needed to be split, for example, because truncation of neurons in the hemibrain removed a key defining feature . Together these revisions mean that the 3,584 reidentified hemibrain cell types map onto 3,643 consensus cell types . All revisions were confirmed by across-dataset connectivity clustering."
"Notably, 1,651  hemibrain cell types could not be reidentified in FlyWire. Ambiguities due to hemibrain truncation can partially explain this: we were much more successful at matching neurons that were not truncated in the hemibrain . However, this appears not to be the main explanation."
"Especially in cases of multiple, very similar, ‘adjacent’ hemibrain types, we often encountered ‘chains’ of ambiguity that made assigning types difficult . Further investigation  suggests that the majority of these unmatched hemibrain types are not exactly replicable across animals. Instead, we show that multiconnectome analysis can generate validated cell types that are robust to interindividual variation."
"In conclusion, we validated 3,643 high-confidence consensus cell type labels for 43,737 neurons from three different hemispheres and two different brains . Collectively these cross-matched neurons cover 46. 5% of central brain edges  in the FlyWire graph."
"This body of high-confidence cross-identified neurons enables both within-brain  and across-brain  comparisons. Cell types are highly stereotyped Using the consensus cell type labels, we found that the numbers of cells per type across the three hemispheres are closely correlated . About one in six cell types shows a difference in numbers between the left and right hemisphere and one in three across brains ."
The mean difference in the number of cells per type is small though: 0. 3  within brains and 0. 8  across brains.
"Importantly, cell types with fewer neurons per type are less variable . At the extreme, ‘singleton’ cell types account for 59% of all types in our sample; they often appear to be embryonic-born, or early secondary neurons, and only very rarely comprise more than one neuron—only 3% of neurons that are singletons in both FlyWire hemispheres have more than 1 member in the hemibrain. By contrast, more numerous cell types are also more likely to vary in number both within but even more so across brains ."
"Synapse counts were also largely consistent within cell types, both within and across brains. To enable a fair comparison, the FlyWire synapse cloud was restricted to the smaller hemibrain volume. Although this does not correct for other potential confounds such as differences in the synaptic completion rates or synapse detection, pre- and post-synapse counts per cell type were highly correlated, both within brains  and across brains ."
"This is an important quality control and pre-requisite for subsequent connectivity comparisons. The fly brain is mostly left–right symmetric, but inspection of the FlyWire dataset revealed a small number of asymmetries. For example, LC6 and LC9 visual projection neurons form a large axon bundle that follows the normal path in the right hemisphere42 but, in the left hemisphere, it loops over  the mushroom body peduncle; nevertheless, the axons still find their correct targets as previously reported43."
"We annotated other examples of this ranging from small additional/missing branches to misguided neurite bundles and found that only 0. 4% of central brain neurons exhibit such biological oddities . Interpreting connectomes Brain wiring develops through a complex and probabilistic developmental process44,45."
"To interpret the connectome, it is vital to obtain a basic understanding of how variable that biological process is. This is complicated by the fact that the connectome we observe is shaped not just by biological variability but also by technical noise, for example, from segmentation issues, synapse detection errors and synaptic completion rates  . Here we use the consensus cell types to assess which connections are reliably observed across three hemispheres of connectome data."
"We use the term ‘edge’ to describe the set of connections between two cell types, and its ‘weight’ as the number of unitary synapses  forming that connection. Weights of individual edges are highly correlated within  and across  brains . Consistent with this, cell types exhibit highly similar connectivity within as well as across brains ."
"While the connectivity  similarity across brains is lower than within brains , the effect size is small  and is at least in part due to the aforementioned truncation in the hemibrain. We next examined, for a given edge between two cell types in one hemisphere, the odds of finding the same connection in another hemisphere or brain. Examination of 572,980 edges present in at least one of the three brain hemispheres showed that 53% of the edges observed in the hemibrain were also found in FlyWire."
"This fraction is slightly higher when comparing between the two FlyWire hemispheres: left to right: 61%; right to left: 59% . Weaker edges were less likely to be consistent: an edge consisting of a single synapse in the hemibrain has a 42% chance to be also present in a single FlyWire hemisphere, and only a 16% chance to be seen in both hemispheres of FlyWire . By contrast, any edge of more than ten synapses in any hemisphere can be reproducibly  found in the other two hemispheres."
"Although only 16% of all edges meet this threshold, they comprise around 79% of all synapses . We also analysed normalized edge weights expressed as the fraction of the input onto each downstream neuron; this accounts for the small difference in synaptic completion rate between FlyWire and the hemibrain. With this treatment, the distributions are almost identical for within and across brain comparisons ); edges constituting ≥0."
"9% of the target cell type’s total inputs have a greater than 90% chance of persisting ). Around 7% of edges, collectively containing over half  of all synapses, meet this threshold. We observed that the fraction of edges persisting across datasets plateaued as the edge weight increased."
"Using a level of 99% edge persistence, we can define a second principled heuristic: edges greater than 2. 6% edge weight  can be considered to be strong. Note that these statistics defined across the whole connectome can have exceptions in individual neurons."
"For example, descending neuron DNp42 receives 34 synapses from PLP146 in FlyWire right, but none on the left or hemibrain; this may well be an example of developmental noise . So far, we have examined only the binary question of whether an edge exists or not. However, the conservation of edge weight is also highly relevant for interpreting connectomes."
"We next considered, given that an edge is present in two or more hemispheres, the odds that it will have a similar weight. Edge weights within and across brains are highly correlated , a 30-synapse edge in the hemibrain, for example, will on average consist of 29 synapses in FlyWire, despite differences in synaptic detection and completion rates for these two datasets imaged with different EM modalities1. The variance of edge weights is considerable though: 25% of all 30-synapse hemibrain edges will consist of fewer than 13 synapses in FlyWire, and 5% will consist of only 1–2 synapses."
"Consistency is greater when looking within FlyWire: a 30-synapse edge on the left will, on average, consist of 31 synapses on the right. Still, 25% of all 30-synapse edges on the left will consist of 21 synapses or less on the right, and 5% of only 1–8 synapses . To assess how much of this edge weight variability is biological and how much is technical, we modelled the impact of technical noise on a fictive ground truth connectome ."
"This model was randomly subsampled according to postsynaptic completion rate , and synapses were randomly added and deleted according to the false-positive and false-negative rates reported for the synapse detection46. Repeated application of this procedure generated a distribution of edge weights between each cell type pair expected due to technical noise alone. On average, 65% of the observed variability of edge weight between hemispheres fell within the range expected due to technical noise; this fraction approached 100% for weaker synapses ."
"For example, cell type LHCENT3 targets LHAV3g2 with 30 synapses on the left but only 23 on the right of Fly- Wire, which is within the 5–95% quantiles expected due to technical noise alone. Overall, this analysis shows that observed variability ) is greater than can be accounted for by technical noise, establishing a lower bound for likely biological variability , and suggests another simple heuristic: differences in edge weights of 30% or less may be entirely due to technical noise and should not be overinterpreted. Variability in the mushroom body The comprehensive annotation of cell types in the FlyWire dataset revealed that the number of Kenyon cells , the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, is 30% larger per hemisphere than in the hemibrain , well above the average variation in cell counts ."
"While these KC counts are within the previously reported range47, the difference presents an opportunity to investigate how connectomes accommodate perturbations in cell count. The mushroom body contains five principal cell classes: KCs, mushroom body output neurons , modulatory neurons  and octopaminergic neurons ), the dorsal paired medial  and anterior paired lateral neuron  giant interneurons48 . KCs further divide into five main cell types on the basis of which parts of the mushroom body they innervate: KCab, KCab-p, KCg-m, KCa′b′ and KCg-d ."
"Of those, KCab, KCa′b′ and KCg-m are the primary recipients of largely random39,49  olfactory input through around 130 antennal lobe projection neurons  comprising 58 canonical types39,40. Global activity in the mushroom body is regulated through an inhibitory feedback loop mediated by APL, a single large GABAergic neuron51. Analogous to the mammalian cerebellum, KCs transform the dense overlapping odour responses of the early olfactory system into sparse non-overlapping representations that enable the animal to discriminate between individual odours during associative learning52,53."
"The difference in cell counts is not evenly distributed across all KC types: KCg-m  are almost twice as numerous in FlyWire versus hemibrain while KCab and KCab-p are present in similar numbers . Protein starvation during the larval stage can induce specific increases in KCg-m number54, suggesting that environmental variations in food resources may have contributed to this difference. To examine how this affects the mushroom body circuitry, we opted to compare the fraction of the input or output synaptic budget across different KCs, as this is well matched to our question and naturally handles a range of technical noise issues that seemed particularly prominent in the mushroom body completion rate ."
"We found that, despite the large difference in KCg-m cell counts between FlyWire and hemibrain, this cell type consistently makes and receives 32% and 45% of all KC pre-synapses and post-synapses, respectively . This suggested that individual FlyWire KCg-m neurons receive fewer inputs and make fewer outputs than their hemibrain counterparts. The share of ALPN outputs allocated to KCg-m is around 55% across all hemispheres , and the average ALPN to KCg-m connection is comparable in strength across hemispheres ; however, each KCg-m neuron receives input from a much smaller number of ALPN types in FlyWire than in the hemibrain ."
"FlyWire KCg-m neurons therefore receive inputs with the same strength but from fewer ALPNs. This pattern holds for other KCg-m synaptic partners as well. Similar to the excitatory ALPNs, the share of APL outputs allocated to KCg-m neurons is essentially constant across hemispheres ."
"Thus, each individual KCg-m neuron receives proportionally less inhibition from the APL, as well as less excitation, maintaining a similar excitation/ inhibition ratio . Furthermore, as a population, KCg-m neurons contribute similar amounts of input to MBONs . Past theoretical work has shown that the number  of discrete odour channels  providing input to each KC has an optimal value for maximizing dimensionality of KC activity and, therefore, discriminability of olfactory input52,53."
"The smaller value for K observed for KCg-m neurons in the FlyWire connectome  raises the question of how dimensionality varies with K for each of the KC types. Using the neural network rate model described previously52, we calculated dimensionality as a function of K for each of the KC types, using the observed KC counts, ALPN to KC connectivity and global inhibition from the APL. This analysis revealed that optimal values for K are lower for KCg-m neurons in FlyWire than in the hemibrain , consistent with the observed values."
"Taken together, these results demonstrate that, for KCg-m neurons, the brain compensates for a developmental perturbation by changing a single parameter: the number of odour channels each KC samples from. By contrast, KCa′b′ cells, which are also more numerous in Fly- Wire than in the hemibrain, appear to use a hybrid strategy of reduced K combined with a reduction in ALPN to KCa′b′ connection strength . These findings contradict earlier studies in which a global increase in KC numbers through genetic manipulation triggered an increase in ALPN axon boutons  and a modest increase in KC claws 55,56."
"This may be due to the differences in the nature and timing of the perturbation in KC cell number, and the KC types affected. Toward multiconnectome cell typing As the first dense, large-scale connectome of a fly brain, the hemibrain dataset proposed over 5,000 previously unknown cell types in addition to confirming around 400 previously reported types recorded in the http://virtualflybrain. org/ database22."
"As this defines a de facto standard cell typing for large parts of the fly brain, our initial work plan was simply to reidentify hemibrain cell types in FlyWire, providing a critical resource for the fly neuroscience community. While this was successful for 68% of hemibrain cell types , 32% could not be validated. Given the great stereotypy generally exhibited by the fly nervous system, this result is both surprising and interesting."
"We can imagine two basic categories of explanation. First, that through ever closer inspection, we may successfully reidentify these missing cell types. Second, that these definitions, mostly based on a single brain hemisphere, might not be robust to variation across individuals."
"Distinguishing between these two explanations is not at all straightforward. We began by applying across-dataset connectivity clustering to large groups of unmatched hemibrain and FlyWire neurons. We observed that most remaining hemibrain types showed complex clustering patterns, which both separated neurons from the same proposed cell type and recombined neurons of different proposed hemibrain types."
"While it is always more difficult to prove a negative result, these observations strongly suggest that the majority of the remaining 1,696 hemibrain types are not robust to interindividual variation. We therefore developed a definition of cell type that uses interanimal variability: a cell type is a group of neurons that are each more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other neuron in the same brain. This definition can be used with different similarity metrics but, for connectomics data, a similarity measure incorporating morphology and/or connectivity is most useful."
"Our algorithmic implementation of this definition operates on the co-clustering dendrogram by finding the smallest possible clusters that satisfy two criteria :  each cluster must contain neurons from all three hemispheres ;  within each cluster, the number of neurons from each hemisphere must be approximately equal. Determining how to cut a dendrogram generated by data clustering is a widespread challenge in data science for which there is no single satisfactory solution. A key advantage of the cell type definition that we propose is that it provides very strong guidance about how to assign neurons to clusters."
"This follows naturally from the fact that connectome data provide us with all neurons in each dataset, rather than a random subsample. This advantage of completeness is familiar from analogous problems such as the ability to identify orthologous genes when whole genomes are available57. Analysis of the hemibrain cell type AOTU063 provides a relatively straightforward example of our approach ."
"Morphology-based clustering generates a single group, comprising all six AOTU063 neurons from each of the three hemispheres. However, clustering based on connectivity reveals two discrete groups, with equal numbers of neurons from each hemisphere, suggesting that this type should be split further. Here, algorithmic analysis across multiple connectomes reveals consistent connectivity differences between subsets of AOTU063 neurons."
"To test whether this approach is applicable to more challenging sets of neurons, we set aside the hemibrain types and performed a complete retyping of neurons in the central complex , a centre for navigation in the insect brain that has been subject to detailed connectome analysis41. We selected two large groups of neurons innervating the fan-shaped body  that show a key difference in organization. The first group, FC1–3 , consists of columnar cell types that tile the FB innervating adjacent non-overlapping columns."
"The second group, FB1–9 , contains tangential neurons where neurons of the same cell type are precisely co-located in space41 . Standard NBLAST similarity assumes that neurons of the same cell type overlap closely in space; although this is true for most central brain types, it does not hold for repeated columnar neurons such as those in the optic lobe or these FC neurons of the FB. We therefore used a connectivity-only distance metric co-clustering across the three hemispheres."
"This resulted in seven FC clusters satisfying the above criteria . Five of these cross-brain types have a one-to-one correspondence with hemibrain types, while two are merges of multiple hemibrain types; only a small number of neurons are recombined across types . For the second group, FB1–9, a combined morphology and connectivity embedding was used."
"Co-clustering across the three hemispheres generated 114 cell types compared to 146 cell types in the hemibrain . In total, 44% of these types correspond one-to-one to a hemibrain cell type; 11% are splits , 12% are merges  and 33% are recombinations  of hemibrain cell types. The 67%  success rate of this de novo approach in identifying hemibrain cell types is slightly higher than the 61% achieved in our directed work in Fig."
"3; it is consistent with the notion that further effort could still identify some unmatched hemibrain types, but that the majority will probably require retyping. All of the preceding efforts have focused on cell typing neurons contained within both FlyWire and the hemibrain. We next examined the extensive regions of the brain covered only by FlyWire and not by hemibrain."
"Based on the lessons learned from the joint analysis of hemibrain and FlyWire, we ran a co-clustering of neurons from the two hemispheres of FlyWire to fill in missing cell types . This combined both morphology and connectivity measures, was carried out separately for each hemilineage and produced 3,200 new central brain cell types for a total of 8,453 including the optic lobes. We further compared double-hemisphere  and triple-hemisphere analysis  for 25 cross-identified lineages that are not truncated in the hemibrain."
"This comparison found that 70% of these new types survive addition of a third hemisphere with minor edits . That percentage increases to 84% if we exclude cases in which just one neuron changes clusters . In summary, cell typing based on joint analysis of multiple connectomes proved capable of recapitulating many cell types identified in the hemibrain dataset, while also defining new candidate cell types that are consistent both within and across datasets."
"Further validation of the new types proposed by this approach will depend on additional Drosophila connectomes, which are forthcoming. We predict that cell types defined in this manner will be substantially more robust than cell types defined from a single connectome alone. Discussion Here we generated human-readable annotations for all neurons in the fly brain at various levels of granularity: superclass, cell class, hemilineage, morphology group and cell type."
"These annotations provide salient groupings that have already been proven to be useful not only in our own analyses, but also in many of those in our companion paper1 as well as other publications in the FlyWire paper package introduced there, and to researchers now using the online platforms Codex  and FAFB-FlyWire CATMAID spaces . Hemilineage annotations also provide a key starting point to link the molecular basis of the development of the central brain to the wiring revealed by the connectome; such work has already begun in the more repetitive circuits of the optic lobe58. The cell type atlas that we provide of 8,453 cell types, covering 96."
"4% of all neurons in the brain, is to our knowledge the largest ever proposed  and, crucially, by some margin the largest ever validated collection of cell types19. In C. elegans, the 118 cell types inferred from the original connectome have been clearly supported by analysis of subsequent connectomes and molecular data3,59,60."
"In a few cases in mammals, it has been possible to produce catalogues of order 100 cell types that have been validated by multimodal data, for example, in the retina or motor cortex20,61. Although large scale molecular atlases in the mouse produce highly informative hierarchies of up to 5,000 clusters62–64, they do not yet try to define terminal cell types—the finest unit that is robust across individuals—with precision. Here we tested over 5,000 predicted cell types, resulting in 3,884 validated cell types using three hemispheres of connectome data."
"Informed by this, we use the FlyWire dataset to propose an additional 3,685 cell types. Lessons for cell typing Our experience of cell typing the FlyWire dataset together with our earlier participation in the hemibrain cell typing effort leads us to draw a number of lessons. First, we think that it is helpful to frame cell types generated in one dataset as predictions or hypotheses that can be tested either through additional connectome data or data from other modalities."
"Related to this, although the two hemispheres of the same brain can be treated as two largely independent datasets, we do see evidence that variability can be correlated across hemispheres . We therefore recommend the use of three or more hemispheres to define and validate new cell types both because of increased statistical confidence and because across-brain comparisons are a strong test of cell type robustness. Third, there is no free lunch in the classic lumping versus splitting debate."
"The hemibrain cell typing effort preferred to split rather than lump cell types, reasoning that over-splitting could easily be remedied by merging cell types at a later date2. Although this approach seemed reasonable at the time, it appears to have led to cell types being recombined: when using a single dataset, even domain experts may find it very hard to distinguish conserved differences between cell types from interindividual noise. Moreover, although some recent studies have argued that cell types are better defined by connectivity than morphology, we find that there is a place for both."
"For de novo cell typing of future connectomes, we recommend an initial morphology-only matching to assign obvious matches; these shared cell type labels can then be used to define connection similarity across datasets. This then allows extraction of balanced clusters from combined morphology and connectivity co-clustering that can be used to assign or refine existing cell types. Related to this, we find that across-dataset connection similarity is an extremely powerful way to identify cell types."
"However, connectivity-based typing is typically used iteratively and especially when used within a single dataset this may lead to selection of idiosyncratic features. Moreover, neurons can connect similarly but come from a different developmental lineage, or express a different neurotransmitter, precluding them from sharing a cell type. Combining these two points, we would summarize that matching by morphology appears to be both more robust and sometimes less precise, whereas connectivity matching is a powerful tool that must be wielded with care."
"In conclusion, connectome data are particularly suitable for cell typing: they are inherently multimodal , while the ability to see all cells within a brain  is uniquely powerful. Our multiconnectome typing approach  provides a robust and efficient way to use such data; cell types that have passed the rigorous test of across-connectome consistency are very unlikely to be revised . We suspect that connectome data will become the gold standard for cell typing."
"Linking molecular and connectomics cell types will therefore be key. One promising new approach is exemplified by the prediction of neurotransmitter identity directly from EM images21 but many others will be necessary. Finally, we address the three questions introduced in the introduction."
"Can we simplify the connectome graph? Cell typing reduces the complexity of the connectome graph. This has important implications for analysis, modelling, experimental work and developmental biology."
"For example, we can reduce the 131,811 typed nodes in the raw connectome graph into a cell type graph with 8,453 nodes; the number of edges is similarly reduced. This should significantly aid human reasoning about the connectome. It will also make numerous network analyses possible as well as substantially reduce the degrees of freedom in brain scale modelling65,66."
"It is important to note that, while collapsing multiple cells for a given cell type into a single node is often desirable, other use cases such as modelling studies may still need to retain each individual cell. However, if key parameters are determined on a per cell type basis, then the complexity of the resultant model can be much reduced. A recent study65 optimized and analysed a highly successful model of large parts of the fly visual system with just 734 free parameters by using connectomic cell types."
"For Drosophila experimentalists using the connectome, cell typing identifies groups of cells that probably form functional units. Most of these are linked though http://virtualflybrain. org/ to the published literature and in many cases to molecular reagents."
"Others will be more easily identified for targeted labelling and manipulation after typing. Finally, cell typing effectively compresses the connectome, reducing the bits required to store and specify the graph. For a fly-sized connectome, this is no longer that important for computational analysis, but it may be important for brain development."
"Some67 have argued that evolution has selected highly structured brain connectivity enabling animals to learn very rapidly, but that these wiring diagrams are far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome; rather, they must be compressed through a ‘genomic bottleneck’, which may itself have been a crucial part of evolving robust and efficient nervous systems. If we accept this argument, lossy compression based on aggregating nodes with similar cell type labels, approximately specifying strong edges and largely ignoring weak edges would reduce the storage requirements by orders of magnitude and could be a specific implementation of this bottleneck. Which edges are important?"
"The question of which of the 15. 1 million edges in the connectome to pay attention to is critical for its interpretation. Intuitively, we assume that the more synapses that connect two neurons, the more important that connection must be."
"There is some very limited evidence in support of this assumption correlating anatomical and functional connectivity68,69 . In lieu of physiological data, we postulate that edges that are critical to brain function should be consistently found across brains. By comparing connections between cell types identified in three hemispheres, we find that edges stronger than ten synapses or ≥0."
"9% of the target’s inputs have a greater than 90% chance to be preserved . This provides a simple heuristic for determining which edges are likely to be functionally relevant. It is also highly consistent with findings from the larval connectome, in which left–right asymmetries in connectivity vanish after removing edges weaker than <1."
"25% . However, note that edges falling below the threshold might still significantly contribute to the brain’s function. We further address an issue that has received little attention : the impact of technical factors  and biological variability on the final connectome and how to compensate for it."
"In our hands, a model of technical noise could explain up to 30% difference in edge weights. While this model was made specifically for the two hemispheres of FlyWire, it highlights the general point that a firm understanding of all sources of variability will be vital for the young field of comparative connectomics to distinguish real and artificial differences. Have we collected a snowflake?"
"The field of connectomics has long been criticized for unavoidably low n73,74, raising the question of whether the brain of a single specimen is representative for all. For insects, there is a large body of evidence for morphological and functional stereotypy, although this information is available for only a minority of neurons and much less is known about stereotyped connectivity19,75,76. For vertebrate brains, the situation is less clear again; it is generally assumed that subcortical regions will be more stereotyped, but cortex also has conserved canonical microcircuits77 and recent evidence has shown that some cortical elements can be genetically and functionally stereotyped78."
"Given how critical stereotypy is for connectomics, it is important to check whether that premise actually still holds true at the synaptic resolution. For the fly connectome, the answer to our question is actually both more nuanced and more interesting than we initially imagined. Based on conservation of edges between FlyWire and hemibrain hemispheres, over 50% of the connectome graph is a snowflake."
"Of course, these non-reproducible edges are mostly weak. Our criterion for strong  edges applies to between 7–16% of edges but 50–70% of synapses. We previously showed that the early olfactory system of the fly is highly stereotyped in both neuronal number and connectivity40."
"That study used the same EM datasets—FAFB and the hemibrain—but was limited in scope as only manual reconstruction in FAFB was then available. We now analyse brain-wide data from two brains  and three hemispheres to address this question and find a high degree of stereotypy at every level: neuron counts are highly consistent between brains, as are connections above a certain weight. However, when examining so many neurons in a brain, we can see that cell counts are very different for some neurons; furthermore, neurons occasionally do something unexpected ."
"In fact, we hypothesize that such stochastic differences are unnoticed variability present in most brains; this is reminiscent of the observation that most humans carry multiple significant genetic mutations. We did observe one example of a substantial biological difference that was consistent across hemispheres but not brains: the number of the KCg-m neurons in the mushroom bodies is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. Notably, we found evidence that the brain compensates for this perturbation by modifying connectivity ."
"In conclusion, we have not collected a snowflake. The core FlyWire connectome is highly conserved and the accompanying annotations will be broadly useful across all studies of D. melanogaster."
"However, our analyses show the importance of calibrating our understanding of biological  variability—as has recently been done across animals in C. elegans60 and across hemispheres in larval Drosophila71,79. This will be crucial when using future connectomes to identify true biological differences, for example, in sexually dimorphic circuits or changes due to learning."
"All tissues and organs in the body consist of cells. The specialized functions of cells and how they interact determine the functions of organs. The brain is an organ—to be sure, the most sophisticated and complex organ that nature has devised."
"But the basic strategy for unraveling its function is no different from that used to investigate the pancreas or the lung. We must begin by learning how brain cells work individually and then see how they are assembled to work together. In neuroscience, there is no need to separate mind from brain; once we fully understand the individual and concerted actions of brain cells, we will understand the origins of our mental abilities."
"The organization of this book reflects this “neurophilosophy. ” We start with the cells of the nervous system—their structure, function, and means of communication. In later chapters, we will explore how these cells are assembled into circuits that mediate sensation, perception, movement, speech, and emotion."
"In this chapter, we focus on the structure of the different types of cells in the nervous system: neurons and glia. These are broad categories, within which are many types of cells that differ based on their structure, chemistry, and function. Nonetheless, the distinction between neurons and glia is important."
"Although there are many neurons in the human brain , glia outnumber neurons by tenfold. Based on these numbers, it might appear that we should focus our attention on glia for insights into the cellular functions of the nervous system. However, neurons are the most important cells for the unique functions of the brain."
"It is the neurons that sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations. Glia, or glial cells, are thought to contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons. If the brain were a chocolate-chip cookie and the neurons were chocolate chips, the glia would be the cookie dough that fills all the other space and ensures that the chips are suspended in their appropriate locations."
"Indeed, the term glia is derived from the Greek word for “glue,” giving the impression that the main function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears! As we shall see later in the chapter, the simplicity of this view is probably a good indication of the depth of our ignorance about glial function. However, we still are confident that neurons perform the bulk of information processing in the brain. Therefore, we will focus 90% of our attention on 10% of brain cells: the neurons."
"Neuroscience, like other fields, has a language all its own. To use this language, you must learn the vocabulary. After you have read this chapter, take a few minutes to review the key terms list and make sure you understand the meaning of each term."
"Your neuroscience vocabulary will grow as you work your way through the book. To study the structure of brain cells, scientists have had to overcome several obstacles. The first was the small size."
Most cells are in the range of 0. 01–0. 05 mm in diameter.
"The tip of an unsharpened pencil lead is about 2 mm across; neurons are 40–200 times smaller. This size is at or beyond the limit of what can be seen by the naked eye. Therefore, progress in cellular neuroscience was not possible before the development of the compound microscope in the late seventeenth century."
"Even then, obstacles remained. To observe brain tissue using a microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much thicker than the diameter of the cells. However, brain tissue has a consistency like a bowl of Jello: not firm enough to make thin slices."
"Thus, the study of the anatomy of brain cells had to await the development of a method to harden the tissue without disturbing its structure and an instrument that could produce very thin slices. Early in the nineteenth century, scientists discovered how to harden, or “fix,” tissues by immersing them in formaldehyde, and they developed a special device called a microtome to make very thin slices. These technical advances spawned the field of histology, the microscopic study of the structure of tissues."
"But scientists studying brain structure faced yet another obstacle. Freshly prepared brain has a uniform, cream-colored appearance under the microscope; the tissue has no differences in pigmentation to enable histologists to resolve individual cells. Thus, the final breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of stains that could selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain tissue."
"One stain, still used today, was introduced by the German neurologist Franz Nissl in the late nineteenth century. Nissl showed that a class of basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells and also stain clumps of material surrounding the nuclei of neurons . These clumps are called Nissl bodies, and the stain is known as the Nissl stain."
"The Nissl stain is extremely useful for two reasons. First, it distinguishes neurons and glia from one another. Second, it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or cytoarchitecture, of neurons in different parts of the brain."
"The study of cytoarchitecture led to the realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions. We now know that each region performs a different function. The Nissl stain, however, does not tell the whole story."
"A Nissl-stained neuron looks like little more than a lump of protoplasm containing a nucleus. Neurons are much more than that, but how much more was not recognized until the publication of the work of Italian histologist Camillo Golgi . In 1873, Golgi discovered that by soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution, now called the Golgi stain, a small percentage of neurons became darkly colored in their entirety ."
"This revealed that the neuronal cell body, the region of the neuron around the nucleus that is shown with the Nissl stain, is actually only a small fraction of the total structure of the neuron. Notice in Figures 2. 1 and 2."
"3 how different histological stains can provide strikingly different views of the same tissue. Today, neurohistology remains an active field in neuroscience, along with its credo: “The gain in brain is mainly in the stain. ” The Golgi stain shows that neurons have at least two distinguishable parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus, and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region."
"The swollen region containing the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably: cell body, soma , and perikaryon . The thin tubes that radiate away from the soma are called neurites and are of two types: axons and dendrites . The cell body usually gives rise to a single axon."
"The axon is of uniform diameter throughout its length, and if it branches, the branches generally extend at right angles. Because axons can travel over great distances in the body , it was immediately recognized by the histologists of the day that axons must act like “wires” that carry the output of the neurons. Dendrites, on the other hand, rarely extend more than 2 mm in length."
"Many dendrites extend from the cell body and generally taper to a fine point. Early histologists recognized that because dendrites come in contact with many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals, or input. Golgi invented the stain, but it was a Spanish contemporary of Golgi who used it to greatest effect."
"Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a skilled histologist and artist who learned about Golgi’s method in 1888 . In a remarkable series of publications over the next 25 years, Cajal used the Golgi stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain . Ironically, Golgi and Cajal drew completely opposite conclusions about neurons."
"Golgi championed the view that the neurites of different cells are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar to the arteries and veins of the circulatory system. According to this reticular theory, the brain is an exception to the cell theory, which states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of all animal tissues. Cajal, on the other hand, argued forcefully that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another and must communicate by contact, not continuity."
"This idea that the neuron adhered to the cell theory came to be known as the neuron doctrine. Although Golgi and Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in 1906, they remained rivals to the end. The scientific evidence over the next 50 years weighed heavily in favor of the neuron doctrine, but final proof had to wait until the development of the electron microscope in the 1950s ."
"With the increased resolving power of the electron microscope, it was finally possible to show that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another. Thus, our starting point in the exploration of the brain must be the individual neuron. The human eye can distinguish two points only if they are separated by more than about one-tenth of a millimeter ."
"Thus, we can say that 100 m is near the limit of resolution for the unaided eye. Neurons have a diameter of about 20 m, and neurites can measure as small as a fraction of a micrometer. The light microscope, therefore, was a necessary development before neuronal structure could be studied."
"But this type of microscopy has a theoretical limit imposed by the properties of microscope lenses and visible light. With the standard light microscope, the limit of resolution is about 0. 1 m."
"However, the space between neurons measures only 0. 02 m . No wonder two esteemed scientists, Golgi and Cajal, disagreed about whether neurites were continuous from one cell to the next."
"This question could not be answered until the electron microscope was developed and applied to biological specimens, which occurred only within the past 60 years or so. The electron microscope uses an electron beam instead of light to form images, dramatically increasing the resolving power. The limit of resolution for an electron microscope is about 0."
"1 nm—a million times better than the unaided eye. Our insights into the fine structure of the inside of neurons—the ultrastructure—have all come from electron microscopic examination of the brain. Today, microscopes on the leading edge of technology use laser beams to illuminate the tissue and computers to create digital images ."
"Unlike the traditional methods of light and electron microscopy, which require tissue fixation, these new techniques give neuroscientists their first chance to peer into brain tissue that is still alive. As we have seen, the neuron  consists of several parts: the soma, the dendrites, and the axon. The inside of the neuron is separated from the outside by the limiting skin, the neuronal membrane, which lies like a circus tent on an intricate internal scaffolding, giving each part of the cell its special three-dimensional appearance."
"Let’s explore the inside of the neuron and learn about the functions of the different parts . The Soma We begin our tour at the soma, the roughly spherical central part of the neuron. The cell body of the typical neuron is about 20 μm in diameter."
"The watery fluid inside the cell, called the cytosol, is a salty, potassiumrich solution that is separated from the outside by the neuronal membrane. Within the soma are a number of membrane-enclosed structures called organelles. The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles that are found in all animal cells."
"The most important ones are the nucleus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria. Everything contained within the confines of the cell membrane, including the organelles but excluding the nucleus, is referred to collectively as the cytoplasm. The Nucleus."
"Its name derived from the Latin word for “nut,” the nucleus of the cell is spherical, centrally located, and about 5–10 μm across. It is contained within a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is perforated by pores that measure about 0."
"1 μm across. Within the nucleus are chromosomes, which contain the genetic material, DNA . Your DNA was passed on to you from your parents, and it contains the blueprint for your entire body."
"The DNA in each of your neurons is the same, and it is the same as the DNA in the cells of your liver and kidney. What distinguishes a neuron from a liver cell are the specific parts of the DNA that are used to assemble the cell. These segments of DNA are called genes."
"Each chromosome contains an uninterrupted double-stranded braid of DNA, 2 nm wide. If the DNA from the 46 human chromosomes were laid out straight, end to end, it would measure more than 2 m in length. If we were to consider this total length of DNA as analogous to the string of letters that makes up this book, the genes would be analogous to the individual words."
Genes can measure anywhere from 0. 1 μm to several micrometers in length. The “reading” of the DNA is known as gene expression.
"The final product of gene expression is the synthesis of molecules called proteins, which exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, perform many different functions, and bestow upon neurons virtually all of their unique characteristics. Protein synthesis, the assembly of protein molecules, occurs in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA never leaves the nucleus, there must be an intermediary that carries the genetic message to the sites of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm."
"This function is performed by another long molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA. Messenger RNA consists of four different nucleic acids strung together in various sequences to form a chain. The detailed sequence of the nucleic acids in the chain represents the information in the gene, just as the sequence of letters gives meaning to a written word."
"The process of assembling a piece of mRNA that contains the information of a gene is called transcription, and the resulting mRNA is called the transcript . Protein-coding genes are flanked by stretches of DNA that are not used to encode proteins but are important for regulating transcription. At one end of the gene is the promoter, the region where the RNA-synthesizing enzyme, RNA polymerase, binds to initiate transcription."
"The binding of the polymerase to the promoter is tightly regulated by other proteins called transcription factors. At the other end is a sequence of DNA called the terminator that the RNA polymerase recognizes as the end point for transcription. In addition to the non-coding regions of DNA that flank the genes, there are often additional stretches of DNA within the gene itself that cannot be used to code for protein."
"These interspersed regions are called introns, and the coding sequences are called exons. Initial transcripts contain both introns and exons, but then, by a process called RNA splicing, the introns are removed and the remaining exons are fused together . In some cases, specific exons are also removed with the introns, leaving an “alternatively spliced” mRNA that actually encodes a different protein."
"Thus, transcription of a single gene can ultimately give rise to several different mRNAs and protein products. Messenger RNA transcripts emerge from the nucleus via pores in the nuclear envelope and travel to the sites of protein synthesis elsewhere in the neuron. At these sites, a protein molecule is assembled much as the mRNA molecule was: by linking together many small molecules into a chain."
"In the case of protein, the building blocks are amino acids, of which there are 20 different kinds. This assembling of proteins from amino acids under the direction of the mRNA is called translation. The scientific study of this process, which begins with the DNA of the nucleus and ends with the synthesis of protein molecules in the cell, is known as molecular biology."
The “central dogma” of molecular biology is summarized as follows:A new field within neuroscience is called molecular neurobiology. Molecular neurobiologists use the information contained in the genes to determine the structure and functions of neuronal proteins . Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum.
"Not far from the nucleus are enclosed stacks of membrane dotted with dense globular structures called ribosomes, which measure about 25 nm in diameter. The stacks are called rough endoplasmic reticulum, or rough ER . Rough ER abounds in neurons, far more than in glia or most other non-neuronal cells."
"In fact, we have already been introduced to rough ER by another name: Nissl bodies. This organelle is stained with the dyes that Nissl introduced 100 years ago. Rough ER is a major site of protein synthesis in neurons."
"RNA transcripts bind to the ribosomes, and the ribosomes translate the instructions contained in the mRNA to assemble a protein molecule. Thus, ribosomes take raw material in the form of amino acids and manufacture proteins using the blueprint provided by the mRNA . Not all ribosomes are attached to the rough ER."
"Many are freely floating and are called free ribosomes. Several free ribosomes may appear to be attached by a thread; these are called polyribosomes. The thread is a single strand of mRNA, and the associated ribosomes are working on it to make multiple copies of the same protein."
"What is the difference between proteins synthesized on the rough ER and those synthesized on the free ribosomes? The answer appears to lie in the intended fate of the protein molecule. If it is destined to reside within the cytosol of the neuron, then the protein’s mRNA transcript shuns the ribosomes of the rough ER and gravitates toward the free ribosomes."
"Sequencing the human genome—the entire length of DNA that comprises the genetic information in our chromosomes—was a truly monumental achievement, completed in 2003. The Human Genome Project identifed all of the approximately 20,000 genes in human DNA. We now live in what has been called the “post-genomic era,” in which information about the genes expressed in our tissues can be used to diagnose and treat diseases."
"Neuroscientists are now using this information to tackle long-standing questions about the biological basis of neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to probe deeper into the origins of individuality. The logic goes as follows. The brain is the product of the genes expressed in it."
"Differences in gene expression between a normal brain and a diseased brain, or a brain of unusual ability, can be used to identify the molecular basis of the observed symptoms or traits. The level of gene expression is usually defined as the number of mRNA transcripts synthesized by different cells and tissues to direct the synthesis of specific proteins. Thus, the analysis of gene expression requires a method to compare the relative abundance of various mRNAs in the brains of two groups of humans or animals."
"One way to perform such a comparison is to use DNA microarrays, which are created by robotic machines that arrange thousands of small spots of synthetic DNA on a microscope slide. Each spot contains a unique DNA sequence that will recognize and stick to a different specific mRNA sequence. To compare the gene expression in two brains, one begins by collecting a sample of mRNAs from each brain."
"The mRNA of one brain is labeled with a chemical tag that fluoresces green, and the mRNA of the other brain is labeled with a tag that fluoresces red. These samples are then applied to the microarray. Highly expressed genes will produce brightly fluorescent spots, and differences in the relative gene expression between the brains will be revealed by differences in the color of the fluorescence ."
"However, if the protein is destined to be inserted into the membrane of the cell or an organelle, then it is synthesized on the rough ER. As the protein is being assembled, it is threaded back and forth through the membrane of the rough ER, where it is trapped . It is not surprising that neurons are so well endowed with rough ER, because, as we shall see in later chapters, special membrane proteins are what give these cells their remarkable information-processing abilities."
"Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi Apparatus. The remainder of the cytosol of the soma is crowded with stacks of membranous organelles that look a lot like rough ER without the ribosomes, so much so that one type is called smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or smooth ER. Smooth ER is actually quite heterogeneous and performs different functions in different locations."
"Some smooth ER is continuous with rough ER and is believed to be a site where the proteins that jut out from the membrane are carefully folded, giving them their three-dimensional structure. Other types of smooth ER play no direct role in the processing of protein molecules but instead regulate the internal concentrations of substances such as calcium. The stack of membrane-enclosed disks in the soma that lies farthest from the nucleus is the Golgi apparatus, first described in 1898 by Camillo Golgi ."
"This is a site of extensive “post-translational” chemical processing of proteins. One important function of the Golgi apparatus is believed to be the sorting of certain proteins that are destined for delivery to different parts of the neuron, such as the axon and the dendrites. The Mitochondrion."
"Another very abundant organelle in the soma is the mitochondrion . In neurons, these sausage-shaped structures measure about 1 μm in length. Within the enclosure of their outer membrane are multiple folds of inner membrane called cristae ."
"Between the cristae is an inner space called matrix . Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration . When a mitochondrion “inhales,” it pulls inside pyruvic acid  and oxygen, both of which are floating in the cytosol."
"Within the inner compartment of the mitochondrion, pyruvic acid enters into a complex series of biochemical reactions called the Krebs cycle, named after the German-British scientist Hans Krebs, who first proposed it in 1937. The biochemical products of the Krebs cycle provide energy that, in another series of reactions within the cristae , results in the addition of phosphate to adenosine diphosphate , yielding adenosine triphosphate , the cell’s energy source. When the mitochondrion “exhales,” 17 ATP molecules are released for every molecule of pyruvic acid that had been taken in."
"ATP is the energy currency of the cell. The chemical energy stored in ATP is used to fuel most of the biochemical reactions of the neuron. For example, as we shall see in Chapter 3, special proteins in the neuronal membrane use the energy released by the breakdown of ATP into ADP to pump certain substances across the membrane to establish concentration differences between the inside and the outside of the neuron."
"The neuronal membrane serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron. The membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins. As mentioned earlier, some of the membrane-associated proteins pump substances from the inside to the outside."
"Others form pores that regulate which substances can gain access to the inside of the neuron. An important characteristic of neurons is that the protein composition of the membrane varies depending on whether it is in the soma, the dendrites, or the axon. The function of neurons cannot be understood without understanding the structure and function of the membrane and its associated proteins."
"In fact, this topic is so important that we’ll spend a good deal of the next four chapters looking at how the membrane endows neurons with the remarkable ability to transfer electrical signals throughout the brain and body. Earlier, we compared the neuronal membrane to a circus tent that was draped on an internal scaffolding. This scaffolding is called the cytoskeleton, and it gives the neuron its characteristic shape."
"The “bones” of the cytoskeleton are the microtubules, microfilaments, and neurofilaments . By drawing an analogy with a scaffolding, we do not mean that the cytoskeleton is static. On the contrary, elements of the cytoskeleton are dynamically regulated and are very likely in continual motion."
"Your neurons are probably squirming around in your head even as you read this sentence. Microtubules. Measuring 20 nm in diameter, microtubules are big and run longitudinally down neurites."
"A microtubule appears as a straight, thick-walled hollow pipe. The wall of the pipe is composed of smaller strands that are braided like rope around the hollow core. Each of the smaller strands consists of the protein tubulin."
"A single tubulin molecule is small and globular; the strand consists of tubulins stuck together like pearls on a string. The process of joining small proteins to form a long strand is called polymerization; the resulting strand is called a polymer. Polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules and, therefore, of neuronal shape can be regulated by various signals within the neuron."
"One class of proteins that participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly and function are microtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs. Among other functions , MAPs anchor the microtubules to one another and to other parts of the neuron. Pathological changes in an axonal MAP, called tau, have been implicated in the dementia that accompanies Alzheimer’s disease ."
"Neurites are the most remarkable structural feature of a neuron. Their elaborate branching patterns, critical for information processing, reflect the organization of the underlying cytoskeleton. It is therefore no surprise that a devastating loss of brain function can result when the cytoskeleton of neurons is disrupted."
"An example is Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by the disruption of the cytoskeleton of neurons in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain crucial for cognitive function. This disorder and its underlying brain pathology were first described in 1907 by the German physician A. Alzheimer in a paper titled “A Characteristic Disease of the Cerebral Cortex."
"” Below are excerpts from the English translation. One of the first disease symptoms of a 51-year-old woman was a strong feeling of jealousy toward her husband. Very soon she showed rapidly increasing memory impairments; she could not find her way about her home, she dragged objects to and fro, hid herself, or sometimes thought that people were out to kill her, then she would start to scream loudly."
"During institutionalization her gestures showed a complete helplessness. She was disoriented as to time and place. From time to time she would state that she did not understand anything, that she felt confused and totally lost."
"Sometimes she considered the coming of the doctor as an official visit and apologized for not having finished her work, but other times she would start to yell in the fear that the doctor wanted to operate on her; or there were times that she would send him away in complete indignation, uttering phrases that indicated her fear that the doctor wanted to damage her woman’s honor. From time to time she was completely delirious, dragging her blankets and sheets to and fro, calling for her husband and daughter, and seeming to have auditory hallucinations. Often she would scream for hours and hours in a horrible voice."
"Mental regression advanced quite steadily. After four and a half years of illness the patient died. She was completely apathetic in the end, and was confined to bed in a fetal position."
"Following her death, Alzheimer examined the woman’s brain under the microscope. He made particular note of changes in the “neurofibrils,” elements of the cytoskeleton that are stained by a silver solution. The Bielschowsky silver preparation showed very characteristic changes in the neurofibrils."
"However, inside an apparently normal-looking cell, one or more single fibers could be observed that became prominent through their striking thickness and specific impregnability. At a more advanced stage,many fibrils arranged parallel showed the same changes. Then they accumulated forming dense bundles and gradually advanced to the surface of the cell."
"Eventually, the nucleus and cytoplasm disappeared, and only a tangled bundle of fibrils indicated the site where once the neuron had been located. As these fibrils can be stained with dyes different from the normal neurofibrils, a chemical transformation of the fibril substance must have taken place. This might be the reason why the fibrils survived the destruction of the cell."
"It seems that the transformation of the fibrils goes hand in hand with the storage of an as yet not closely examined pathological product of the metabolism in the neuron. About one-quarter to one-third of all the neurons of the cerebral cortex showed such alterations. Numerous neurons, especially in the upper cell layers, had totally disappeared."
"The severity of the dementia in Alzheimer’s disease is well correlated with the number and distribution of what are now commonly known as neurofibrillary tangles, the “tombstones” of dead and dying neurons . Indeed, as Alzheimer speculated, tangle formation in the cerebral cortex very likely causes the symptoms of the disease. Electron microscopy reveals that the major components of the tangles are paired helical filaments, long fibrous proteins braided together like strands of a rope ."
"It is now understood that these filaments consist of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau normally functions as a bridge between the microtubules in axons, ensuring that they run straight and parallel to one another. In Alzheimer’s disease, the tau detaches from the microtubules and accumulates in the soma."
"This disruption of the cytoskeleton causes the axons to wither, thus impeding the normal flow of information in the affected neurons. What causes the changes in tau? Attention is focused on another protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, called amyloid."
"The field of Alzheimer’s disease research moves very fast, but the consensus today is that the abnormal secretion of amyloid by neurons is the first step in the process that leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation and dementia. Current hope for therapeutic intervention is focused on strategies to reduce the depositions of amyloid in the brain. The need for effective therapy is urgent: In the United States alone, more than 4 million people are afflicted with this tragic disease."
"Microfilaments. Measuring only 5 nm in diameter, microfilaments are about the same thickness as the cell membrane. Found throughout the neuron, they are particularly numerous in the neurites."
"Microfilaments are braids of two thin strands, and the strands are polymers of the protein actin. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells of all types, including neurons, and is believed to play a role in changing cell shape. Indeed, as we shall see in Chapter 13, actin filaments are critically involved in the mechanism of muscle contraction."
"Like microtubules, actin microfilaments are constantly undergoing assembly and disassembly, and this process is regulated by signals in the neuron. Besides running longitudinally down the core of the neurites like microtubules, microfilaments are also closely associated with the membrane. They are anchored to the membrane by attachments with a meshwork of fibrous proteins that line the inside of the membrane like a spider web."
"Neurofilaments. With a diameter of 10 nm, neurofilaments are intermediate in size between microtubules and microfilaments. They exist in all cells of the body as intermediate filaments; only in neurons are they called neurofilaments."
"The difference in name actually does reflect subtle differences in structure from one tissue to the next. An example of an intermediate filament from another tissue is keratin, which, when bundled together, makes up hair. Of the types of fibrous structure we have discussed, neurofilaments most closely resemble the bones and ligaments of the skeleton."
"A neurofilament consists of multiple subunits  that are organized like a chain of sausages. The internal structure of each subunit consists of three protein strands woven together. Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, these strands consist of individual long protein molecules, each of which is coiled in a tight, springlike configuration."
"This structure makes neurofilaments mechanically very strong. The Axon So far, we’ve explored the soma, organelles, membrane, and cytoskeleton. However, none of these structures is unique to neurons; they are found in all the cells in our body."
"Now we encounter the axon, a structure found only in neurons that is highly specialized for the transfer of information over distances in the nervous system. The axon begins with a region called the axon hillock, which tapers to form the initial segment of the axon proper . Two noteworthy features distinguish the axon from the soma: 1."
"No rough ER extends into the axon, and there are few, if any, free ribosomes. 2. The protein composition of the axon membrane is fundamentally different from that of the soma membrane."
"These structural differences translate into functional distinctions. Because there are no ribosomes, there is no protein synthesis in the axon. This means that all proteins in the axon must originate in the soma."
"And it is the different proteins in the axonal membrane that enable it to serve as the “telegraph wire” that sends information over great distances. Axons may extend from less than a millimeter to over a meter long. Axons often branch, and these branches are called axon collaterals."
"Occasionally, an axon collateral will return to communicate with the same cell that gave rise to the axon or with the dendrites of neighboring cells. These axon branches are called recurrent collaterals. The diameter of an axon is variable, ranging from less than 1 mm to about 25 mm in humans and to as large as 1 mm in the squid."
"This variation in axon size is important. As will be explained in Chapter 4, the speed of the electrical signal that sweeps down the axon—the nerve impulse—varies depending on axonal diameter. The thicker the axon, the faster the impulse travels."
"The Axon Terminal. All axons have a beginning , a middle , and an end. The end is called the axon terminal or terminal bouton , reflecting the fact that it usually appears as a swollen disk ."
"The terminal is a site where the axon comes in contact with other neurons  and passes information on to them. This point of contact is called the synapse, a word derived from the Greek, meaning “to fasten together. ” Sometimes axons have many branches at their ends, and each branch forms a synapse on dendrites or cell bodies in the same region."
These branches are collectively called the terminal arbor. Sometimes axons form synapses at swollen regions along their length and then continue on to terminate elsewhere. Such swellings are called boutons en passant .
"In either case, when a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell, it is said to innervate that cell, or to provide innervation. The cytoplasm of the axon terminal differs from that of the axon in several ways: The Synapse. Although Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted entirely to how information is transferred from one neuron to another at the synapse, we provide a preview here."
"The synapse has two sides: presynaptic and postsynaptic . These names indicate the usual direction of information flow, which is from “pre” to “post. ” The presynaptic side generally consists of an axon terminal, while the postsynaptic side may be the dendrite or soma of another neuron."
"The space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes is called the synaptic cleft. The transfer of information at the synapse from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission. At most synapses, information in the form of electrical impulses traveling down the axon is converted in the terminal into a chemical signal that crosses the synaptic cleft."
"On the postsynaptic membrane, this chemical signal is converted again into an electrical one. The chemical signal is called a neurotransmitter, and it is stored in and released from the synaptic vesicles within the terminal. As we will see, different neurotransmitters are used by different types of neurons."
"This electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical transformation of information makes possible many of the brain’s computational abilities. Modification of this process is involved in memory and learning, and synaptic transmission dysfunction accounts for certain mental disorders. The synapse is also the site of action for many toxins and for most psychoactive drugs."
"Axoplasmic Transport. As mentioned, one feature of the cytoplasm of axons, including the terminal, is the absence of ribosomes. Because ribosomes are the protein factories of the cell, their absence means that the proteins of the axon must be synthesized in the soma and then shipped down the axon."
"Indeed, in the mid-nineteenth century, English physiologist Augustus Waller showed that axons cannot be sustained when separated from their parent cell body. The degeneration of axons that occurs when they are cut is now called Wallerian degeneration. Because it can be detected with certain staining methods, Wallerian degeneration is one way to trace axonal connections in the brain."
"Wallerian degeneration occurs because the normal flow of materials from the soma to the axon terminal is interrupted. This movement of material down the axon is called axoplasmic transport, first demonstrated directly by the experiments of American neurobiologist Paul Weiss and his colleagues in the 1940s. They found that if they tied a thread around an axon, material accumulated on the side of the axon closest to the soma."
"When the knot was untied, the accumulated material continued down the axon at a rate of 1–10 mm per day. This was a remarkable discovery, but it is not the whole story. If all material moved down the axon by this transport mechanism alone, it would not reach the ends of the longest axons for at least half a year—too long a wait to feed hungry synapses."
"In the late 1960s, methods were developed to track the movements of protein molecules down the axon into the terminal. These methods entailed injecting the somata of neurons with radioactive amino acids. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins."
"The “hot” amino acids were assembled into proteins, and the arrival of radioactive proteins in the axon terminal was measured to calculate the rate of transport. Bernice Grafstein of Rockefeller University discovered that this fast axoplasmic transport  occurred at a rate as high as 1000 mm per day. Much is now known about how axoplasmic transport works."
"Material is enclosed within vesicles, which then “walk down” the microtubules of the axon. The “legs” are provided by a protein called kinesin, and the process is fueled by ATP . Kinesin moves material only from the soma to the terminal."
"All movement of material in this direction is called anterograde transport. In addition to anterograde transport, there is a mechanism for the movement of material up the axon from the terminal to the soma. This process is believed to provide signals to the soma about changes in the metabolic needs of the axon terminal."
"Movement in this direction, from terminal to soma, is called retrograde transport. The molecular mechanism is similar to anterograde transport, except the “legs” for retrograde transport are provided by a different protein, dynein. Both anterograde and retrograde transport mechanisms have been exploited by neuroscientists to trace connections in the brain ."
"The term dendrite is derived from the Greek for “tree,” reflecting the fact that these neurites resemble the branches of a tree as they extend from the soma. The dendrites of a single neuron are collectively called a dendritic tree; each branch of the tree is called a dendritic branch. The wide variety of shapes and sizes of dendritic trees are used to classify different groups of neurons."
"Because dendrites function as the antennae of the neuron, they are covered with thousands of synapses . The dendritic membrane under the synapse  has many specialized protein molecules called receptors that detect the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Fast anterograde transport of proteins in axons was shown by injecting the soma with radioactive amino acids."
"The success of this method immediately suggested a way to trace connections in the brain. For example, to determine where neurons in the eye send their axons, the eye was injected with radioactive proline, an amino acid. The proline was incorporated into proteins in the somata that were then transported to the axon terminals."
"By use of a technique called autoradiography, the location of radioactive axon terminals could be detected, thereby revealing the extent of the connection between the eye and the brain. Researchers subsequently discovered that retrograde transport could also be exploited to work out connections in the brain. Strangely enough, the enzyme horseradish peroxidase  is selectively taken up by axon terminals and then transported retrogradely to the soma."
A chemical reaction can then be initiated to visualize the location of the HRP in slices of brain tissue. This method is commonly used to trace connections in the brain . Some viruses also exploit retrograde transport to infect neurons.
"For example, the oral type of herpesvirus enters axon terminals in the lips and mouth and is then transported back to the parent cell bodies. Here the virus usually remains dormant until physical or emotional stress occurs , at which time it replicates and returns to the nerve ending, causing a painful cold sore. Similarly, the rabies virus enters the nervous system by retrograde transport through axons in the skin."
"However, once inside the soma, the virus wastes no time in replicating madly, killing its neuronal host. The virus is then taken up by other neurons within the nervous system, and the process repeats itself again and again, usually until the victim dies. The dendrites of some neurons are covered with specialized structures called dendritic spines that receive some types of synaptic input."
Spines look like little punching bags that hang off the dendrite . The unusual morphology of spines has fascinated neuroscientists ever since their discovery by Cajal. They are believed to isolate various chemical reactions that are triggered by some types of synaptic activation.
Spine structure is sensitive to the type and amount of synaptic activity. Unusual changes in spines have been shown to occur in the brains of individuals with cognitive impairments . William Greenough of the University of Illinois at Urbana discovered that spine number is also very sensitive to the quality of the environment experienced during early development and in adulthood .
"The elaborate architecture of a neuron’s dendritic tree is a good reflection of the complexity of its synaptic connections with other neurons. Brain function depends on these highly precise synaptic connections, which are formed during the fetal period and are refined during infancy and early childhood. Not surprisingly, this very complex developmental process is vulnerable to disruption."
"Mental retardation is said to have occurred if a disruption of brain development results in subaverage cognitive functioning that impairs adaptive behavior. The use of standardized tests indicates that intelligence in the general population is distributed along a bell-shaped  curve. By convention, the mean intelligence quotient  is set to be 100."
"About twothirds of the total population falls within 15 points  of the mean, and 95% of the population falls within 30 points . People with intelligence scores below 70 are considered to be mentally retarded if the cognitive impairment affects the person’s ability to adapt his or her behavior to the setting in which he or she lives. Some 2–3% of humans fit this description."
Mental retardation has many causes. The most severe forms are associated with genetic disorders. An example is a condition called phenylketonuria .
"The basic abnormality is a deficit in the liver enzyme that metabolizes the dietary amino acid phenylalanine. Infants born with PKU have an abnormally high level of the amino acid in the blood and brain. If the condition goes untreated, brain growth is stunted and severe mental retardation results."
"Another example is Down syndrome, which occurs when the fetus has an extra copy of chromosome 21, thus disrupting normal gene expression during brain development. A second known cause of mental retardation is accidents during pregnancy and childbirth. Examples are maternal infections with German measles  and asphyxia during childbirth."
"A third cause of mental retardation is poor nutrition during pregnancy. An example is fetal alcohol syndrome, a constellation of developmental abnormalities that occur in children born to alcoholic mothers. A fourth cause, thought to account for the majority of cases, is environmental impoverishment— the lack of good nutrition, socialization, and sensory stimulation—during infancy."
"While some forms of mental retardation have very clear physical correlates , most cases have only behavioral manifestations. The brains of these individuals appear grossly normal. How, then, do we account for the profound cognitive impairment?"
"An important clue came in the 1970s from the research of Miguel Marin-Padilla, working at Dartmouth College, and Dominick Purpura, working at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Using the Golgi stain, they studied the brains of retarded children and discovered remarkable changes in dendritic structure. The dendrites of retarded children had many fewer dendritic spines, and the spines that they did have were unusually long and thin ."
The extent of the spine changes was well correlated with the degree of mental retardation. Dendritic spines are an important target of synaptic input. Purpura pointed out that the dendritic spines of mentally retarded children resemble those of the normal human fetus.
"He suggested that mental retardation reflects the failure of normal circuits to form in the brain. In the 3 decades since this seminal work was published, it has been established that normal synaptic development, including maturation of the dendritic spines, depends critically on the environment during infancy and early childhood. An impoverished environment during an early “critical period” of development can lead to profound changes in the circuits of the brain."
"However, there is some good news. Many of the deprivation-induced changes in the brain can be reversed if intervention occurs early enough. In Chapter 22, we will take a closer look at the role of experience in brain development."
"It is a frequent misconception that scientific research results in simple, clear answers to questions. The truth is that almost every answer results in a whole battery of new questions. But the research serves to increase our understanding so that we know how to frame the new questions, and try to tackle them."
"When we first saw polyribosomes below synapses in dendritic spines, we asked: “What are they doing away from the soma, where mRNA is usually translated? ” An exciting possibility was that they might make special proteins that were involved in remodeling the synapse. I had seen that in animals exposed to enriched environments, new spines were made and other spines were remodeled from small to larger structures with—presumably— more efficient signaling."
"Could these synaptic polyribosomes be manufacturing crucial proteins that could account for the improved efficiency? Some kind of “memory proteins”? I recalled a paper by Hollingsworth, in which he figured out a way to shear off synapses on spines, a preparation called synaptoneurosomes , and study them biochemically."
"My colleague Ivan Jeanne Weiler and I attempted to isolate the mRNA in synaptoneurosomes to identify the crucial “memory proteins. ” Repeated failures, due apparently to mRNA degradation, both frustrated and slowed us. But eventually we found that some of the mRNA was being incorporated into polyribosomes, meaning that protein was being synthesized."
"We then discovered that this protein synthesis was strongly increased when we stimulated the synaptoneurosomes with the neurotransmitter glutamate, and we were able to identify the glutamate receptor that was responsible. We now thought we were poised to isolate the “memory proteins” from the newly assembled polyribosomes. We set up to harvest polyribosomes from stimulated and unstimulated synaptoneurosomes to see which mRNAs were translated in response to glutamate."
"About this time, Jim Eberwine  told us about the mRNAs he had isolated from single dendrites. We looked for their translation in our new system, and the first one that was increased by stimulation turned out to be the fragile X mental retardation protein . This has led us to study brain abnormalities in fragile X syndrome, the largest cause of inherited mental retardation."
"Do we now, at last, have a “memory protein”? Not yet, because FMRP is not a structural or receptor protein, but a protein that binds mRNA. It seems to orchestrate the translation of an impressive array of other mRNAs, few of which, at first glance, look like “memory proteins."
"” But, if FMRP is a key to how the synapse changes itself, then we think we are still on the right track to understand synaptic remodeling. Indeed, people with fragile X syndrome have immature-appearing synapses. So we have been wrong a lot of the time, and frustrated on a near-weekly basis."
"Nature is full of surprises, but we have increased our understanding of synaptic protein synthesis. Indeed, we are now asking new questions that may help us understand and possibly treat the leading inherited form of mental retardation. It was worth the effort."
"For the most part, the cytoplasm of dendrites resembles that of axons. It is filled with cytoskeletal elements and mitochondria. One interesting difference was discovered by neuroscientist Oswald Steward."
"He found that polyribosomes can be observed in dendrites, often right under spines. Steward’s research suggests that synaptic transmission can actually direct local protein synthesis in some neurons. In Chapter 25, we will see that synaptic regulation of protein synthesis is crucial for information storage by the brain."
"It is unlikely that we can ever hope to understand how each of the hundred billion neurons in the nervous system uniquely contributes to the function of the brain. But what if we could show that all the neurons in the brain can be divided into a small number of categories, and that within each category, all neurons function identically? The complexity of the problem might then be reduced to understanding the unique contribution of each category, rather than each cell."
It is with this hope that neuroscientists have devised schemes for classifying neurons. Neurons can be classified according to the total number of neurites  that extend from the soma . A neuron that has a single neurite is said to be unipolar.
"If there are two neurites, the cell is bipolar, and if there are three or more, the cell is multipolar. Most neurons in the brain are multipolar. Dendritic trees can vary widely from one type of neuron to another."
"Some have inspired elegant names like “double bouquet cells. ” Others have less interesting names, such as “alpha cells. ” Classification is often unique to a particular part of the brain."
"For example, in the cerebral cortex , there are two broad classes: stellate cells  and pyramidal cells  . Another simple way to classify neurons is according to whether their dendrites have spines. Those that do are called spiny, and those that do not are called aspinous."
"These dendritic classification schemes can overlap. For example, in the cerebral cortex, all pyramidal cells are spiny. Stellate cells, on the other hand, can be either spiny or aspinous."
"Information is delivered to the nervous system by neurons that have neurites in the sensory surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the retina of the eye. Cells with these connections are called primary sensory neurons. Other neurons have axons that form synapses with the muscles and command movements; these are called motor neurons."
"But most neurons in the nervous system form connections only with other neurons. According to this classification scheme, these cells are all called interneurons. Some neurons have long axons that extend from one part of the brain to the other; these are called Golgi type I neurons, or projection neurons."
"Other neurons have short axons that do not extend beyond the vicinity of the cell body; these are called Golgi type II neurons, or local circuit neurons. In the cerebral cortex, for example, pyramidal cells usually have long axons that extend to other parts of the brain and are therefore Golgi type I neurons. In contrast, stellate cells have axons that never extend beyond the cerebral cortex and are therefore Golgi type II neurons."
"The classification schemes presented so far are based on the morphology of neurons as revealed by a Golgi stain. Newer methods that enable neuroscientists to identify which neurons contain specific neurotransmitters have resulted in a scheme for classifying neurons based on their chemistry. For example, the motor neurons that command voluntary movements all release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at their synapses."
"These cells are therefore also classified as cholinergic, meaning that they use this particular neurotransmitter. Collections of cells that use a common neurotransmitter make up the brain’s neurotransmitter systems . We have devoted most of our attention in this chapter to the neurons."
"While this decision is justified by the state of current knowledge, some neuroscientists consider glia to be the “sleeping giants” of neuroscience. One day, they suppose, it will be shown that glia contribute much more importantly to information processing in the brain than is currently appreciated. At present, however, the evidence indicates that glia contribute to brain function mainly by supporting neuronal functions."
"Although their role may be subordinate, without glia, the brain could not function properly. The most numerous glia in the brain are called astrocytes . These cells fill the spaces between neurons."
"The space that remains between the neurons and the astrocytes in the brain measures only about 20 nm wide. Consequently, astrocytes probably influence whether a neurite can grow or retract. And when we speak of fluid “bathing” neurons in the brain, it is more like a soaking from a hose than immersion in a swimming pool."
"An essential role of astrocytes is regulating the chemical content of this extracellular space. For example, astrocytes envelop synaptic junctions in the brain, thereby restricting the spread of neurotransmitter molecules that have been released. Astrocytes also have special proteins in their membranes that actively remove many neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft."
"A recent and unexpected discovery is that astrocytic membranes also possess neurotransmitter receptors that, like the receptors on neurons, can trigger electrical and biochemical events inside the glial cell. Besides regulating neurotransmitters, astrocytes also tightly control the extracellular concentration of several substances that have the potential to interfere with proper neuronal function. For example, astrocytes regulate the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid."
"Unlike astrocytes, the primary function of oligodendroglial and Schwann cells is clear. These glia provide layers of membrane that insulate axons. Boston University anatomist Alan Peters, a pioneer in the electron microscopic study of the nervous system, showed that this wrapping, called myelin, spirals around axons in the brain ."
"Because the axon fits inside the spiral wrapping like a sword in its scabbard, the name myelin sheath describes the entire covering. The sheath is interrupted periodically, leaving a short length where the axonal membrane is exposed. This region is called a node of Ranvier ."
"We will see in Chapter 4 that myelin serves to speed the propagation of nerve impulses down the axon. Oligodendroglia and Schwann cells differ in their location and some other characteristics. For example, oligodendroglia are found only in the central nervous system , while Schwann cells are found only in the peripheral nervous system ."
"Another difference is that one oligodendroglial cell will contribute myelin to several axons, while each Schwann cell myelinates only a single axon. Even if we eliminated every neuron, every astrocyte, and every oligodendroglial cell, other cells would still remain in the brain. For the sake of completeness, we must mention these other cells."
"First, special cells called ependymal cells provide the lining of fluid-filled ventricles within the brain, and they also play a role in directing cell migration during brain development. Second, a class of cells called microglia function as phagocytes to remove debris left by dead or degenerating neurons and glia. Finally, the vasculature of the brain—arteries, veins, and capillaries—would still be there."
"Learning about the structural characteristics of the neuron provides insight into how neurons and their different parts work, because structure correlates with function. For example, the absence of ribosomes in the axon correctly predicts that proteins in the axon terminal must be provided by the soma via axoplasmic transport. A large number of mitochondria in the axon terminal correctly predicts a high energy demand."
"The elaborate structure of the dendritic tree appears ideally suited for the receipt of incoming information, and indeed, this is where most of the synapses are formed with the axons of other neurons. From the time of Nissl, it has been recognized that an important feature of neurons is the rough ER. What does this tell us about neurons?"
"We have said that rough ER is a site of the synthesis of proteins destined to be inserted into the membrane. We will now see how the various proteins in the neuronal membrane give rise to the unique capabilities of neurons to transmit, receive, and store information. Vision is remarkable—it lets us detect things as tiny and close as a mosquito on the tip of our nose, or as immense and far away as a galaxy near the fringes of the universe."
"Sensitivity to light enables animals, including humans, to detect prey, predators, and mates. Based on the light bounced into our eyes from objects around us, we somehow make sense of a complex world. While this process seems effortless, it is in reality extremely complicated."
"Indeed, it has proven quite difficult to make computer visual systems with even a small fraction of the capabilities of the human visual system. Light is electromagnetic energy that is emitted in the form of waves. We live in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic radiation."
"Like any ocean, this sea has large waves and small waves, short wavelets and long rollers. The waves crash into objects and are absorbed, scattered, reflected, and bent. Because of the nature of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with the environment, the visual system can extract information about the world."
"This is a big job, and it requires a lot of neural machinery. However, the mastery of vision over the course of vertebrate evolution has had surprising rewards. It has provided new ways to communicate, given rise to brain mechanisms for predicting the trajectory of objects and events in time and space, allowed for new forms of mental imagery and abstraction, and led to the creation of a world of art."
"The significance of vision is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that about half of the human cerebral cortex is involved with analyzing the visual world. The mammalian visual system begins with the eye. At the back of the eye is the retina, which contains photoreceptors specialized to convert light energy into neural activity."
"The rest of the eye acts like a camera and forms crisp, clear images of the world on the retina. Like a camera, the eye automatically adjusts to differences in illumination and automatically focuses itself on objects of interest. The eye has some additional features not yet available on cameras, such as the ability to track moving objects  and the ability to keep its transparent surfaces clean ."
"While much of the eye functions like a camera, the retina is much more than film. In fact, as mentioned in Chapter 7, the retina is actually part of the brain. In a sense, each eye has two overlapping retinas: one specialized for low light levels that we encounter from dusk to dawn, and another specialized for higher light levels and for the detection of color, from sunrise to sunset."
"Regardless of the time of day, however, the output of the retina is not a faithful reproduction of the intensity of the light falling on it. Rather, the retina is specialized to detect differences in the intensity of light falling on different parts of it. Image processing is well under way in the retina, before any visual information reaches the rest of the brain."
"Axons of retinal neurons are bundled into optic nerves, which distribute visual information  to several brain structures that perform different functions. Some targets of the optic nerves are involved in regulating biological rhythms, which are synchronized with the light-dark daily cycle; others are involved in the control of eye position and optics. However, the first synaptic relay in the pathway that serves visual perception occurs in a cell group of the dorsal thalamus called the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN."
"From the LGN, visual information ascends to the cerebral cortex, where it is interpreted and remembered. In this chapter, we explore the eye and the retina. We’ll see how light carries information to our visual system, how the eye forms images on the retina, and how the retina converts light energy into neural signals that canbe used to extract information about luminance and color differences."
"In Chapter 10, we will pick up the visual pathway at the back of the eye and take it through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. The visual system uses light to form images of the world around us. Let’s briefly review the physical properties of light and its interactions with the environment."
"Electromagnetic radiation is all around us. It comes from innumerable sources, including radio antennas, mobile phones, X-ray machines, and the sun. Light is the electromagnetic radiation that is visible to our eyes."
"Electromagnetic radiation can be described as a wave of energy. Like any wave, electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength, the distance between successive peaks or troughs; a frequency, the number of waves per second; and an amplitude, the difference between wave trough and peak . The energy content of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to its frequency."
"Radiation emitted at a high frequency  has the highest energy content; examples are gamma radiation emitted by some radioactive materials and X-rays used for medical imaging, with wavelengths less than 109 m . Conversely, radiation emitted at lower frequencies  has less energy; examples are radar and radio waves, with wavelengths greater than 1 mm. Only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum is detectable by our visual system; visible light consists of wavelengths of 400–700 nm ."
"As first shown by Isaac Newton early in the eighteenth century, the mix of wavelengths in this range emitted by the sun appears to humans as white, whereas light of a single wavelength appears as one of the colors of the rainbow. It is interesting to note that a “hot” color like red or orange consists of light with a longer wavelength, and hence has less energy, than a “cool” color like blue or violet. Clearly, colors are themselves “colored” by the brain, based on our subjective experiences."
"In a vacuum, a wave of electromagnetic radiation will travel in a straight line and thus can be described as a ray. Light rays in our environment also travel in straight lines until they interact with the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere and objects on the ground. These interactions include reflection, absorption, and refraction ."
The study of light rays and their interactions is called optics. Reflection is the bouncing of light rays off a surface. The manner in which a ray of light is reflected depends on the angle at which it strikes the surface.
"A ray striking a mirror perpendicularly is reflected 180° back upon itself, a ray striking the mirror at a 45° angle is reflected 90°, and so on. Most of what we see is light that has been reflected off objects in our environment. Absorption is the transfer of light energy to a particle or surface."
"You can feel this energy transfer on your skin on a sunny day, as visible light is absorbed and warms you up. Surfaces that appear black absorb the energy of all visible wavelengths. Some compounds absorb light energy only in a limited range of wavelengths, then reflect the remaining wavelengths."
"This property is the basis for the colored pigments of paints. For example, a blue pigment absorbs long wavelengths but reflects a range of short wavelengths centered on 430 nm that are perceived as blue. As we will see in a moment, light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the retina contain pigments and use the energy absorbed from light to generate changes in membrane potential."
"Images are formed in the eye by refraction, the bending of light rays that can occur when they travel from one transparent medium to another. Consider a ray of light passing from the air into a pool of water. If the ray strikes the water surface perpendicularly, it will pass through in a straight line."
"However, if light strikes the surface at an angle, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the surface. This bending of light occurs because the speed of light differs in the two media; light passes through air more rapidly than through water. The greater the difference between the speed of light in the two media, the greater the angle of refraction."
"The transparent media in the eye bend light rays to form images on the retina. The eye is an organ specialized for the detection, localization, and analysis of light. Here we introduce the structure of this remarkable organ in terms of its gross anatomy, ophthalmoscopic appearance, and cross-sectional anatomy."
"When you look into someone’s eyes, what are you really looking at? The main structures are shown in Figure 9. 4."
"The pupil is the opening that allows light to enter the eye and reach the retina; it appears dark because of the light-absorbing pigments in the retina. The pupil is surrounded by the iris, whose pigmentation provides what we call the eye’s color. The iris contains two muscles that can vary the size of the pupil; one makes it smaller when it contracts, the other makes it larger."
"The pupil and iris are covered by the glassy transparent external surface of the eye, the cornea. The cornea is continuous with the sclera, the “white of the eye,” which forms the tough wall of the eyeball. The eyeball sits in a bony eye socket in the skull, also called the eye’s orbit."
"Inserted into the sclera are three pairs of extraocular muscles, which move the eyeball in the orbit. These muscles normally are not visible because they lie behind the conjunctiva, a membrane that folds back from the inside of the eyelids and attaches to the sclera. The optic nerve, carrying axons from the retina, exits the back of the eye, passes through the orbit, and reaches the base of the brain near the pituitary gland."
"Another view of the eye is afforded by the ophthalmoscope, a device that enables one to peer into the eye through the pupil to the retina . The most obvious feature of the retina viewed through an ophthalmoscope is the blood vessels on its surface. These retinal vessels originate from a pale circular region called the optic disk, which is also where the optic nerve fibers exit the retina."
"It is interesting to note that the sensation of light cannot occur at the optic disk because there are no photoreceptors here, nor can it occur where the large blood vessels exist because the vessels cast shadows on the retina. And yet, our perception of the visual world appears seamless. We are not aware of any holes in our field of vision because the brain fills in our perception of these areas."
"However, there are tricks by which we can demonstrate the “blind” retinal regions . At the middle of each retina is a darker-colored region with a yellowish hue. This is the macula , the part of the retina for central  vision."
"Besides its color, the macula is distinguished by the relative absence of large blood vessels. Notice in Figure 9. 5 that the vessels arc from the optic disk to the macula; this is also the trajectory of the optic nerve fibers from the macula en route to the optic disk."
"The relative absence of large blood vessels in this region of the retina is one of the specializations that improves the quality of central vision. Another specialization of the central retina can sometimes be discerned with the ophthalmoscope: the fovea, a dark spot about 2 mm in diameter. The term is from the Latin for “pit,” and the retina is thinner in the fovea than elsewhere."
"Because it marks the center of the retina, the fovea is a convenient anatomical reference point. Thus, the part of the retina that lies closer to the nose than the fovea is called nasal, the part that lies near the temple is called temporal, the part of the retina above the fovea is called superior, and that below it is called inferior. A look through an ophthalmoscope reveals that there is a sizable hole in the retina."
"The region where the optic nerve axons exit the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter the eye, the optic disk, is completely devoid of photoreceptors. Moreover, the blood vessels coursing across the retina are opaque and block the light from falling on photoreceptors beneath them. Although we normally don’t notice them, these blind regions can be demonstrated."
"Look at Figure A. Hold the book about 1. 5 ft away, close your right eye, and fixate on the cross with your left eye."
"Move the book  around slightly, and eventually you will find a position where the black circle disappears. At this position, the spot is imaged on the optic disk of the left eye. This region of visual space is called the blind spot for the left eye."
"The blood vessels are a little tricky to demonstrate, but give this a try. Get a standard household flashlight. In a dark or dimly lit room, close your left eye ."
"Look straight ahead with the open right eye, and shine the flashlight at an angle into the corner of the eye from the side. Jiggle the light back and forth, up and down. If you’re lucky, you’ll see an image of your own retinal blood vessels."
"This is possible because the illumination of the eye at this oblique angle causes the retinal blood vessels to cast long shadows on the adjacent regions of retina. For the shadows to be visible, they must be swept back and forth on the retina, hence the jiggling of the light. If we have all these light-insensitive regions in the retina, why does the visual world appear uninterrupted and seamless?"
The answer is that mechanisms in the visual cortex appear to “fill in” the missing regions. Perceptual filling-in can be demonstrated with the stimulus shown in Figure B. Fixate on the cross with your left eye and move the book closer and farther from your eye.
"You’ll find a distance at which you will see a continuous uninterrupted line. At this point, the space in the line is imaged on the blind spot, and your brain fills in the gap. A cross-sectional view of the eye shows the path taken by light as it passes through the cornea toward the retina ."
"The cornea lacks blood vessels and is nourished by the fluid behind it, the aqueous humor. This view reveals the transparent lens located behind the iris. The lens is suspended by ligaments  attached to the ciliary muscles, which are attached to the sclera and form a ring inside the eye."
"As we shall see, changes in the shape of the lens enable our eyes to adjust their focus to different viewing distances. The lens also divides the interior of the eye into two compartments containing slightly different fluids. The aqueous humor is the watery fluid that lies between the cornea and the lens."
"The more viscous, jellylike vitreous humor lies between the lens and the retina; its pressure serves to keep the eyeball spherical. Although the eyes do a remarkable job of delivering precise visual information to the rest of the brain, a variety of disorders can compromise this ability . The eye collects the light rays emitted by or reflected off objects in the environment, and focuses them onto the retina to form images."
"Bringing objects into focus involves the combined refractive powers of the cornea and lens. You may be surprised to learn that the cornea, rather than the lens, is the site of most of the refractive power of the eyes. Consider the light emitted from a distant source, perhaps a bright star at night."
"We see the star as a point of light because the eye focuses the star’s light to a point on the retina. The light rays striking the surface of the eye from a distant star are virtually parallel, so they must be bent by the process of refraction. Recall that as light passes into a medium where its speed is slowed, it will bend toward a line that is perpendicular to the border, or interface, between the media ."
"This is precisely the situation as light strikes the cornea and passes from the air into the aqueous humor. As shown in Figure 9. 7, the light rays that strike the curved surface of the cornea bend so that they converge on the back of the eye; those that enter the center of the eye pass straight to the retina."
"The distance from the refractive surface to the point where parallel light rays converge is called the focal distance. Focal distance depends on the curvature of the cornea— the tighter the curve, the shorter the focal distance. The equation in Figure 9."
"7 shows that the reciprocal of the focal distance in meters is a unit of measurement called the diopter. The cornea has a refractive power of about 42 diopters, which means that parallel light rays striking the corneal surface will be focused 0. 024 m  behind it, about the distance from cornea to retina."
"To get a sense of the large amount of refraction produced by the cornea, note that many prescription eyeglasses have a power of only a few diopters. Remember that refractive power depends on the slowing of light at the air-cornea interface. If we replace air with a medium that passes light at about the same speed as the eye, the refractive power of the cornea will be eliminated."
"This is why things look blurry when you open your eyes underwater; the water-cornea interface has very little focusing power. A scuba mask restores the air-cornea interface and, consequently, the refractive power of the eye. Although the cornea performs most of the eye’s refraction, the lens also contributes another dozen or so diopters to the formation of a sharp image at a distant point."
"However, the lens is involved more importantly in forming crisp images of objects located closer than about 9 m from the eye. As objects approach, the light rays originating at a point can no longer be considered to be parallel. Rather, these rays diverge, and greater refractive power is required to bring them into focus on the retina."
"This additional focusing power is provided by changing the shape of the lens, a process called accommodation . Once you know the basic structure of the eye, you can understand how a partial or complete loss of vision results from abnormalities in various components. For example, if there is an imbalance in the extraocular muscles of the two eyes, the eyes will point in different directions."
"Such a misalignment or lack of coordination between the two eyes is called strabismus, and there are two varieties. In esotropia, the directions of gaze of the two eyes cross, and the person is said to be cross-eyed. In exotropia, the directions of gaze diverge, and the person is said to be walleyed ."
"In most cases, strabismus of either type is congenital; it can and should be corrected during early childhood. Treatment usually involves the use of prismatic glasses or surgery to the extraocular muscles to realign the eyes. Without treatment, conflicting images are sent to the brain from the two eyes, degrading depth perception, and, more importantly, causing the person to suppress input from one eye."
"The dominant eye will be normal but the suppressed eye will become amblyopic, meaning that it has poor visual acuity. If medical intervention is delayed until adulthood, the condition cannot be corrected. A common eye disorder among older adults is cataract, a clouding of the lens ."
"Many people over 65 years of age have some degree of cataract; if it significantly impairs vision, surgery is usually required. In a cataract operation, the lens is removed and replaced with an artificial plastic lens. Although the artificial lens cannot adjust its focus like the normal lens, it provides a clear image, and glasses can be used for near and far vision ."
"Glaucoma, a progressive loss of vision associated with elevated intraocular pressure, is a leading cause of blindness. Pressure in the aqueous humor plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape of the eye. As this pressure increases, the entire eye is stressed, ultimately damaging the relatively weak point where the optic nerve leaves the eye."
"The optic nerve axons are compressed, and vision is gradually lost from the periphery inward. Unfortunately, by the time a person notices a loss of more central vision, the damage is advanced and a significant portion of the eye is permanently blind. For this reason, early detection and treatment with medication or surgery to reduce intraocular pressure are essential."
"The light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye is the site of numerous disorders that pose a significant risk of blindness. You may have heard of a professional boxer having a detached retina. As the name implies, the retina pulls away from the underlying wall of the eye from a blow to the head or by shrinkage of the vitreous humor."
"Once the retina has started to detach, fluid from the vitreous space flows through small tears in the retina resulting from the trauma, thereby causing more of the retina to separate. Symptoms of retinal detachment include abnormal perception of shadows and flashes of light. Treatment often involves laser surgery to scar the edge of the retinal tear, thereby reattaching the retina to the back of the eye."
"Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors. The first sign is usually a loss of peripheral vision and night vision. Subsequently, total blindness may result."
"The cause of this disease is unknown. In some forms, it clearly has a strong genetic component, and more than 100 genes have been identified that can contain mutations leading to retinitis pigmentosa. There is currently no cure, but taking vitamin A may slow its progression."
"In contrast to the tunnel vision typically experienced by patients with retinitis pigmentosa, people with macular degeneration lose only central vision. The condition is quite common, affecting more than 25% of all Americans over 65 years of age. While peripheral vision usually remains normal, the ability to read, watch television, and recognize faces is lost as central photoreceptors gradually deteriorate."
"Laser surgery can sometimes minimize further vision loss, but the disease currently has no known cure. When the ciliary muscles are relaxed and the lens is flat, the eye is said to be emmetropic if parallel light rays from a distant point source are focused sharply on the back of the retina. Stated another way, the emmetropic eye focuses parallel light rays on the retina without the need for accommodation ."
"Now consider what happens when the eyeball is too short from front to back . The light rays are focused at some point behind the retina, and the image of a point of light is a blurry spot on the retina. This condition is known as hyperopia, or farsightedness, because the eye can focus on far objects but the lens cannot accommodate enough to form an image on near points."
"Farsightedness can be corrected by placing a convex glass or plastic lens in front of the eye . The curved front edge of the lens, like the cornea, bends light toward the center of the retina. Also, as the light passes from glass into air as it exits the lens, the back of the lens also increases the refraction ."
"If the eyeball is too long rather than too short, parallel rays will converge before the retina, cross, and again be imaged on the retina as a blurry circle . This condition is known as myopia, or nearsightedness. The amount of refraction provided by the cornea and lens is too great to focus distant objects."
"Thus, for the nearsighted eye to see distant points clearly, artificial concave lenses must be used to move the point image back onto the retina . Some eyes have irregularities such that the curvature and refraction in the horizontal and vertical planes is different. This condition is called astigmatism, and it can be corrected by using an artificial lens that is curved more along one axis than others."
"Even if you are fortunate enough to have perfectly shaped eyeballs and a symmetrical refractive system, you probably will not escape presbyopia . This condition is a hardening of the lens that accompanies the aging process and is thought to be explained by the fact that while new lens cells are generated throughout life, none are lost. The hardened lens is less elastic, leaving it unable to change shape and accommodate sufficiently to focus on both near and far objects."
"The correction for presbyopia, first introduced by Benjamin Franklin, is a bifocal lens. These lenses are concave on top to assist far vision and convex on the bottom to assist near vision. In hyperopia and myopia, the amount of refraction provided by the cornea is either too little or too great for the length of the eyeball."
"But modern techniques can now change the amount of refraction the cornea provides. In radial keratotomy, a procedure to correct myopia, tiny incisions through the peripheral portion of the cornea relax and flatten the central cornea, thus reducing the amount of refraction and minimizing the myopia. The most recent techniques use lasers to reshape the cornea."
"In photorefractive keratectomy , a laser is used to reshape the outer surface of the cornea by vaporizing thin layers. In laser in situ keratomileusis , a thin flap of the cornea is lifted so the laser can reshape the cornea from the inside. Nonsurgical methods are also being used to reshape the cornea."
"A person can be fitted with special retainer contact lenses or plastic corneal rings, which alter the shape of the cornea and correct refractive errors. Recall that the ciliary muscle forms a ring around the lens. During accommodation, the ciliary muscle contracts and swells in size, thereby making the area inside the muscle smaller and decreasing the tension in the suspensory ligaments."
"Consequently, the lens becomes rounder and thicker because of its natural elasticity. This rounding increases the curvature of the lens surfaces, thereby increasing their refractive power. Conversely, relaxation of the ciliary muscle increases the tension in the suspensory ligaments, and the lens is stretched into a flatter shape."
"The ability to accommodate changes with age. An infant’s eyes can focus objects just beyond his or her nose, whereas many middle-aged adults cannot clearly see objects closer than about arm’s length. Fortunately, artificial lenses can compensate for this and other defects of the eye’s optics ."
"In addition to the cornea and the lens, the pupil contributes to the optical functioning of the eye by continuously adjusting for different ambient light levels. To check this for yourself, stand in front of a bathroom mirror with the lights out for a few seconds, and then watch your pupils change size when you turn the lights on. This pupillary light reflex involves connections between the retina and neurons in the brain stem that control the muscles that constrict the pupils."
"An interesting property of this reflex is that it is consensual; shining a light into only one eye causes the constriction of the pupils of both eyes. It is unusual, indeed, when the pupils are not the same size; the lack of a consensual pupillary light reflex is often taken as a sign of a serious neurological disorder involving the brain stem. Constriction of the pupil has the effect of increasing the depth of focus, just like decreasing the aperture size  on a camera lens."
"To understand why this is true, consider two points in space, one close and the other far away. When the eye accommodates to the closer point, the image of the farther point on the retina no longer forms a point, but rather a blurred circle. Decreasing the aperture—constricting the pupil— reduces the size of this blurred circle so that its image more closely approximates a point."
"In this way, distant objects appear to be less out of focus. The structure of the eyes, and where they sit in our head, limits how much of the world we can see at any one time. Let’s investigate the extent of the space seen by one eye."
"Holding a pencil in your right hand, close your left eye and look at a point straight ahead. Keeping your eye fixated on this point, slowly move the pencil to the right  across your field of view until the pencil disappears. Repeat this exercise, moving the pencil to the left where it will disappear behind your nose, and then up and down."
The points where you can no longer see the pencil mark the limits of the visual field for your right eye. Now look at the middle of the pencil as you hold it horizontally in front of you. Figure 9.
"9 shows how the light reflected off this pencil falls on your retina. Notice that the image is inverted; the left visual field is imaged on the right side of the retina, and the right visual field is imaged on the left side of the retina. The ability of the eye to distinguish two nearby points is called visual acuity."
"Acuity depends on several factors, but especially on the spacing of photoreceptors in the retina and the precision of the eye’s refraction. Distance across the retina can be described in terms of degrees of visual angle. A right angle subtends  90°, and the moon, for example, subtends an angle of about 0."
"5° . We can speak of the eye’s ability to resolve points that are separated by a certain number of degrees of visual angle. The Snellen eye chart, which we have all read at the doctor’s office, tests our ability to discriminate letters and numbers at a viewing distance of 20 feet."
"Your vision is 20/20 when you can recognize a letter that subtends an angle of 0. 083° . Now that we have an image formed on the retina, we can get to the neuroscience of vision: the conversion of light energy into neural activity."
"To begin our discussion of image processing in the retina, we must introduce the cellular architecture of this bit of brain. The basic system of retinal information processing is shown in Figure 9. 11."
"The most direct pathway for visual information to exit the eye is from photoreceptors to bipolar cells to ganglion cells. The ganglion cells fire action potentials in response to light, and these impulses propagate down the optic nerve to the rest of the brain. Besides the cells in this direct path from photoreceptor to brain, retinal processing is influenced by two additional cell types."
"Horizontal cells receive input from the photoreceptors and project neurites laterally to influence surrounding bipolar cells and photoreceptors. Amacrine cells receive input from bipolar cells and project laterally to influence surrounding ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and other amacrine cells. There are two important points to remember here: The only light-sensitive cells in the retina are the photoreceptors."
All other cells are influenced by light only via direct and indirect synaptic interactions with the photoreceptors. The ganglion cells are the only source of output from the retina. No other retinal cell type projects an axon through the optic nerve.
Now let’s take a look at how the different cell types are arranged in the retina. shows that the retina has a laminar organization: Cells are organized in layers. Notice that the layers are seemingly inside-out; light must pass from the vitreous humor through the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before it reaches the photoreceptors.
"Because the retinal cells above the photoreceptors are relatively transparent, image distortion is minimal as light passes through them. One reason the inside-out arrangement is advantageous is that the pigmented epithelium that lies below the photoreceptors plays a critical role in the maintenance of the photoreceptors and photopigments. The pigmented epithelium also absorbs any light that passes entirely through the retina, thus minimizing the reflection of light within the eye that would blur the image."
"The cell layers of the retina are named in reference to the middle of the eyeball. Thus, the innermost layer is the ganglion cell layer, which contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells. Next is the inner nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the bipolar cells, the horizontal and amacrine cells."
"The next layer is the outer nuclear layer, which contains the cell bodies of the photoreceptors. Finally, the layer of photoreceptor outer segments contains the light-sensitive elements of the retina. The outer segments are embedded in the pigmented epithelium."
"Between the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer is the inner plexiform layer, which contains the synaptic contacts between bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells. Between the outer and inner nuclear layers is the outer plexiform layer, where the photoreceptors make synaptic contact with the bipolar and horizontal cells. The conversion of electromagnetic radiation into neural signals occurs in the 125 million photoreceptors at the back of the retina."
"Every photoreceptor has four regions: an outer segment, an inner segment, a cell body, and a synaptic terminal. The outer segment contains a stack of membranous disks. Light-sensitive photopigments in the disk membranes absorb light, thereby triggering changes in the photoreceptor membrane potential ."
"Figure 9. 13 shows the two types of photoreceptor in the retina, easily distinguished by the appearance of their outer segments. Rod photoreceptors have a long, cylindrical outer segment, containing many disks."
"Cone photoreceptors have a shorter, tapering outer segment with fewer membranous disks. The structural differences between rods and cones correlate with important functional differences. For example, the greater number of disks and higher photopigment concentration in rods makes them over 1000 times more sensitive to light than cones."
"Indeed, under nighttime lighting, or scotopic conditions, only rods contribute to vision. Conversely, under daytime lighting, or photopic conditions, cones do the bulk of the work. For this reason, the retina is said to be duplex—a scotopic retina using only rods, and a photopic retina using mainly cones."
"Rods and cones differ in other respects as well. All rods contain the same photopigment, but there are three types of cone, each containing a different pigment. The variations among pigments make the different cones sensitive to different wavelengths of light."
"As we shall see in a moment, only the cones, not the rods, are responsible for our ability to see color. Retinal structure varies from the fovea to the retinal periphery. In general, the peripheral retina has a higher ratio of rods to cones ."
"It also has a higher ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells. The combined effect of this arrangement is that the peripheral retina is more sensitive to light, because  rods are specialized for low light, and  there are more photoreceptors feeding information to each ganglion cell. You can prove this to yourself on a starry night."
"First, spend about 20 minutes in the dark getting oriented, and then gaze at a bright star. Fixating on this star, search your peripheral vision for a dim star. Then move your eyes to look at this dim star."
"You will find that the faint star disappears when it is imaged on the central retina  but reappears when it is imaged on the peripheral retina . The same characteristics that enable the peripheral retina to detect faint stars at night make it relatively poor at resolving fine details in daylight. This is because daytime vision requires cones, and because good visual acuity requires a low ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells."
"The region of retina most highly specialized for high-resolution vision is the fovea. Recall that the fovea is a thinning of the retina at the center of the macula. In cross section, the fovea appears as a pit in the retina."
"Its pitlike appearance is due to the lateral displacement of the cells above the photoreceptors, allowing light to strike the photoreceptors without passing through the other retinal cell layers . This structural specialization maximizes visual acuity at the fovea by pushing aside other cells that might scatter light and blur the image. The central fovea also is unique because it contains no rods; all the photoreceptors are cones."
"The photoreceptors convert, or transduce, light energy into changes in membrane potential. We begin our discussion of phototransduction with rods, which outnumber cones in the human retina by 20 to 1. Most of what has been learned about phototransduction by rods has proven to be applicable to cones as well."
"As we discussed in Part I, one way information is represented in the nervous system is as changes in the membrane potential of neurons. Thus, we look for a mechanism by which the absorption of light energy can be transduced into a change in the photoreceptor membrane potential. In many respects, this process is analogous to the transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals that occurs during synaptic transmission."
"At a G-proteincoupled neurotransmitter receptor, for example, the binding of transmitter to the receptor activates G-proteins in the membrane, which in turn stimulate various effector enzymes . These enzymes alter the intracellular concentration of cytoplasmic second messenger molecules, which  change the conductance of membrane ion channels, thereby altering membrane potential. Similarly, in the photoreceptor, light stimulation of the photopigment activates G-proteins, which in turn activate an effector enzyme that changes the cytoplasmic concentration of a second messenger molecule."
"This change causes a membrane ion channel to close, and the membrane potential is thereby altered . Recall from Chapter 3 that a typical neuron at rest has a membrane potential of about 65 mV, close to the equilibrium potential for K. In contrast, in complete darkness, the membrane potential of the rod outer segment is about 30 mV."
"This depolarization is caused by the steady influx of Na through special channels in the outer segment membrane . The movement of positive charge across the membrane, which occurs in the dark, is called the dark current. Sodium channels are stimulated to open—are gated—by an intracellular second messenger called cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP."
"Evidently, cGMP is continually produced in the photoreceptor by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, keeping the Na channels open. Light reduces cGMP, causing the Na channels to close, and the membrane potential becomes more negative . Thus, photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light."
"The hyperpolarizing response to light is initiated by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the photopigment in the membrane of the stacked disks in the rod outer segments. In the rods, this pigment is called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin can be thought of as a receptor protein with a prebound chemical agonist."
"The receptor protein is called opsin, and it has the seven transmembrane alpha helices typical of G-protein-coupled receptors throughout the body. The prebound agonist is called retinal, a derivative of vitamin A. The absorption of light causes a change in the conformation of retinal so that it activates the opsin ."
"This process is called bleaching because it changes the wavelengths absorbed by the rhodopsin . The bleaching of rhodopsin stimulates a G-protein called transducin in the disk membrane, which in turn activates the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase , which breaks down the cGMP that is normally present in the cytoplasm of the rod . The reduction in cGMP causes the Na channels to close and the membrane to hyperpolarize."
"One of the interesting functional consequences of using a biochemical cascade for transduction is signal amplification. Many G-proteins are activated by each photopigment molecule, and each PDE enzyme breaks down more than one cGMP molecule. This amplification gives our visual system the ability to detect as little as a single photon, the elementary unit of light energy."
"The complete sequence of events of phototransduction in rods is illustrated in. In bright sunlight, cGMP levels in rods fall to the point where the response to light becomes saturated; additional light causes no more hyperpolarization. Thus, vision during the day depends entirely on the cones, whose photopigments require more energy to become bleached."
"The process of phototransduction in cones is virtually the same as in rods; the only major difference is in the type of opsins in the membranous disks of the cone outer segments. The cones in our retinas contain one of three opsins that give the photopigments different spectral sensitivities. Thus, we can speak of “blue” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 430 nm, “green” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 530 nm, and “red” cones that are maximally activated by light with a wavelength of about 560 nm ."
"Color Detection. The color that we perceive is largely determined by the relative contributions of blue, green, and red cones to the retinal signal. The fact that our visual system detects colors in this way was actually predicted almost 200 years ago by British physicist Thomas Young."
"Young showed in 1802 that all the colors of the rainbow, including white, could be created by mixing the proper ratio of red, green, and blue light . He proposed, quite correctly, that at each point in the retina there exists a cluster of three receptor types, each type being maximally sensitive to either blue, green, or red. Young’s ideas were later championed by Hermann von Helmholtz, an influential nineteenth-century German physiologist."
"This theory of color vision came to be known as the Young-Helmholtz trichromacy theory. According to the theory, the brain assigns colors based on a comparison of the readout of the three cone types. When all types of cones are equally active, as in broad-spectrum light, we perceive “white."
"” Various forms of color blindness result when one or more of the cone photopigment types is missing . If cones alone make the perception of color possible, we should be unable to perceive color differences when cones are inactive. This inference is correct, and you can demonstrate it to yourself."
"Go outside on a dark night and try to distinguish the colors of different objects. It is difficult to detect colors at night because only the rods, with a single type of photopigment, are activated under dim lighting conditions. The peak sensitivity of the rods is to a wavelength of about 500 nm, perceived as blue-green ."
"This fact is the basis for two points of view about the design of automobile dashboard indicator lights. One view is that the lights should be dim blue-green to take advantage of the spectral sensitivity of the rods. An alternate view is that the lights should be bright red because this wavelength affects mainly cones, leaving the rods unsaturated, resulting in better night vision."
"This transition from all-cone daytime vision to all-rod nighttime vision is not instantaneous; it takes about 20–25 minutes . This phenomenon is called dark adaptation, or getting used to the dark. Sensitivity to light actually increases a millionfold or more during this period."
"Dark adaptation is explained by a number of factors. Perhaps the most obvious is dilation of the pupils, which allows more light to enter the eye. However, the diameter of the human pupil only ranges from about 2–8 mm, meaning that changes in its size can increase the pupil area by a factor of only 16."
"The larger component of dark adaptation involves the regeneration of unbleached rhodopsin and an adjustment of the functional circuitry of the retina so that information from more rods is available to each ganglion cell. Because of this tremendous increase in sensitivity, when the dark-adapted eye goes back into bright light, it is temporarily saturated. This explains what happens when you first go outside on a bright day."
"Over the next 5–10 minutes, the eyes undergo light adaptation, reversing the changes in the retina that accompanied dark adaptation. This light-dark adaptation in the duplex retina gives our visual system the ability to operate in light intensities ranging from moonless midnight to bright high noon. Calcium’s Role in Light Adaptation."
"In addition to the factors mentioned above, the ability of the eye to adapt to changes in light level relies on changes in calcium concentration within the cones. When you step out into bright light from a dark theater, initially the cones are hyperpolarized as much as possible . If the cones stayed in this state, we would be unable to see changes in light level."
"As we discussed above, the constriction of the pupil helps a bit in reducing the light entering the eye. However, the most important change is a gradual depolarization of the membrane back to about 35 mV. The reason this happens stems from the fact that the cGMP-gated sodium channels we discussed previously also admit calcium."
"In the dark, Ca2 enters the cones and has an inhibitory effect on the enzyme  that synthesizes cGMP. When the cGMP-gated channels close, the flow of Ca2 into the photoreceptor is curtailed; as a result, more cGMP is synthesized , thereby allowing the cGMP-gated channels to open again. Stated more simply, when the channels close, a process is initiated that gradually reopens them even if the light level does not change."
"Calcium also appears to affect photopigments and phosphodiesterase in ways that decrease their response to light. These calciumbased mechanisms ensure that the photoreceptors are always able to register relative changes in light level, though information about the absolute level is lost. The color we perceive is largely determined by the relative amounts of light absorbed by the red, green, and blue visual pigments in our cones."
"This means it’s possible to perceive any color of the rainbow by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light. For example, the perception of yellow light can be matched by an appropriate mixture of red and green light. Because we use a “three-color” system, humans are referred to as trichromats."
"However, not all normal trichromats perceive colors exactly the same. For example, if a group of people are asked to choose the wavelength of light that most appears green without being yellowish or bluish, there will be small variations in the choices. However, significant abnormalities of color vision extend well beyond this range of normal trichromatic vision."
"Most abnormalities in color vision are the result of small genetic errors that lead to the loss of one visual pigment or a shift in the spectral sensitivity of one type of pigment. The most common abnormalities involve redgreen color vision, and they are much more common in men than women. The reason for this pattern is that the genes encoding the red and green pigments are on the X chromosome, whereas the gene that encodes the blue pigment is on chromosome 7."
Men will have abnormal red-green vision if there is a defect on the single X chromosome they inherit from their mother. Women will have abnormal red-green vision only if both parents contribute abnormal X chromosomes. About 6% of men have a red or green pigment that absorbs somewhat different wavelengths of light than the pigments of the rest of the population.
"These men are referred to as anomalous trichromats because they require somewhat different mixtures of red, green, and blue to see intermediate colors  than other people do. Most anomalous trichromats have normal genes to encode the blue pigment and either the red or the green pigment, but they also have a hybrid gene that encodes a protein with an abnormal absorption spectrum between that of normal red and green pigments. For example, a person with an anomalous green pigment can match a yellow light with a red-green mixture containing less red than a normal trichromat."
"Anomalous trichromats perceive the full spectrum of colors that normal trichromats perceive, but in rare instances they will disagree about the precise color of an object . About 2% of men actually lack either the red or the green pigment, making them red-green color-blind. Because this leaves them with a “two-color” system, they are referred to as dichromats."
"People lacking the green pigment are less sensitive to green, and they confuse certain red and green colors that appear different to trichromats. A “green dichromat” can match a yellow light with either red or green light, no mixture is needed. In contrast to the roughly 8% of men that are either missing one pigment or have an anomalous pigment, only about 1% of women have such color abnormalities."
"People without one color pigment are considered colorblind, but they actually perceive quite a colorful world. Estimates of the number of people lacking all color vision vary, but less than about 0. 001% of the population is thought to have this condition."
"In one type, both red and green cone pigments are missing, in many cases because mutations of the red and green genes make them nonfunctional. These people are blue cone monochromats and they live in a world that varies only in lightness, like a trichromat’s perception of a black-and-white movie. Recent research has shown that, precisely speaking, there may not be such a thing as normal color vision."
"In a group of males classified as normal trichromats, it was found that some require slightly more red than others to perceive yellow in a red-green mixture. This difference, which is tiny compared to the deficits discussed above, results from a single alteration of the red pigment gene. The 60% of males who have the amino acid serine at site 180 in the red pigment gene are more sensitive to longwavelength light than the 40% who have the amino acid alanine at this site."
"Imagine what would happen if a woman had different red gene varieties on her two X chromosomes. Both red genes should be expressed, leading to different red pigments in two populations of cones. In principle, such women should have a form of tetrachromatic color vision, a rarity among all animals."
"Well before the discovery of how photoreceptors work, researchers were able to explain some of the ways the retina processes visual images. Since about 1950, neuroscientists have studied the action potential discharges of retinal ganglion cells as the retina is stimulated with light. The pioneers of this approach were neurophysiologists Keffer Hartline, Stephen Kuffler, and Horace Barlow, with Hartline and Kuffler working in the United States and Barlow working in England."
Their research uncovered which aspects of a visual image were encoded as ganglion cell output. Early studies of horseshoe crabs and frogs gave way to investigations of cats and monkeys. Researchers learned that similar principles are involved in retinal processing across a wide range of species.
"Progress in understanding how ganglion cell properties are generated by synaptic interactions in the retina has been slower. This is because only ganglion cells fire action potentials; all other cells in the retina  respond to stimulation with graded changes in membrane potential. The detection of such graded changes requires technically challenging intracellular recording methods, whereas action potentials can be detected using simple extracellular recording methods ."
"It was not until the early 1970s that John Dowling and Frank Werblin at Harvard University were able to show how ganglion cell responses are built from the interactions of horizontal and bipolar cells . The most direct path for information flow in the retina is from a cone photoreceptor to bipolar cell to ganglion cell. At each synaptic relay, the responses are modified by the lateral connections of horizontal cells and amacrine cells."
"We first focus on how information is transformed as it passes from photoreceptors to bipolar cells and then explore ganglion cell output in the last section. Photoreceptors, like other neurons, release neurotransmitter when depolarized. The transmitter released by photoreceptors is the amino acid glutamate."
"As we have seen, photoreceptors are depolarized in the dark and are hyperpolarized by light. We thus have the counterintuitive situation in which photoreceptors actually release fewer transmitter molecules in the light than in the dark. However, we can reconcile this apparent paradox if we take the point of view that dark rather than light is the preferred stimulus for a photoreceptor."
"Thus, when a shadow passes across a photoreceptor, it responds by depolarizing and releasing neurotransmitter. In the outer plexiform layer, each photoreceptor is in synaptic contact with two types of retinal neuron: bipolar cells and horizontal cells. Recall that bipolar cells create the direct pathway from photoreceptors to ganglion cells; horizontal cells feed information laterally in the outer plexiform layer to influence the activity of neighboring bipolar cells and photoreceptors ."
"Bipolar Cell Receptive Fields. Bipolar cells can be categorized into two classes, based on their responses to the glutamate released by photoreceptors. In OFF bipolar cells, glutamate-gated cation channels mediate a classical depolarizing EPSP from the influx of Na."
ON biopolar cells have Gprotein- coupled receptors and respond to glutamate by hyperpolarizing. Notice that the names OFF and ON refer to whether these cells depolarize in response to light off  or to light on . Each bipolar cell receives direct synaptic input from a cluster of photoreceptors.
"The number of photoreceptors in this cluster ranges from one at the center of the fovea to thousands in the peripheral retina. In addition to these direct connections with photoreceptors, bipolar cells also are connected via horizontal cells to a circumscribed ring of photoreceptors that surrounds this central cluster. The receptive field of a bipolar cell  is the area of retina that, when stimulated with light, changes the cell’s membrane potential."
"The receptive field of a bipolar cell consists of two parts: a circular area of retina providing direct photoreceptor input, called the receptive field center, and a surrounding area of retina providing input via horizontal cells, called the receptive field surround . Receptive field dimensions can be measured in millimeters across the retina or, more commonly, in degrees of visual angle. One millimeter on the retina corresponds to a visual angle of about 3."
5°. Bipolar cell receptive field diameters range from a fraction of a degree in the central retina to several degrees in the peripheral retina. The response of a bipolar cell’s membrane potential to light in the receptive field center is opposite to that of light in the surround.
"For example, if illumination of the center causes depolarization of the bipolar cell , then illumination of the surround will cause an antagonistic hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell . Likewise, if the cell is depolarized by a spot turning from light to dark in the center of its receptive field , it will be hyperpolarized by the same dark stimulus applied to the surround. Thus, these cells are said to have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields."
"The antagonistic surround appears to come from a complex interaction of horizontal cells, photoreceptors, and bipolar cells at their synapses. The center-surround receptive field organization is passed on from bipolar cells to ganglion cells via synapses in the inner plexiform layer. The lateral connections of the amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer also contribute to the elaboration of ganglion cell receptive fields and the integration of rod and cone input to ganglion cells."
"Numerous types of amacrine cells have been identified, and their particular contributions to ganglion cell responses are still being investigated. The sole source of output from the retina to the rest of the brain is the action potentials arising from the million or so ganglion cells. The activity of these cells can be recorded electrophysiologically not only in the retina but also in the optic nerve where their axons travel."
"Much of my scientific life has been spent studying the functional organization of the vertebrate retina—how the retinal cells are wired, how they respond when the retina is illuminated, and how the retina processes visual information. What led me to undertake this research? As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I worked in George Wald’s laboratory at Harvard."
"Wald discovered the role of vitamin A in vision  and had long been interested in photoreceptor mechanisms. With Wald, I studied the effects of vitamin A deficiency on photoreceptors, which brought me to the question of how visual sensitivity relates to visual pigment levels in photoreceptors. In other words, what mechanisms underlie the loss of visual sensitivity in vitamin A deficiency, and does this relate to the sensitivity changes that occur during light and dark adaptation?"
"This early work was carried out in the rat, and I found there is a relationship between visual pigment  levels and the logarithm of visual sensitivity in both vitamin A deficiency and during dark adaptation. Rat retinas, however, possess mainly rod photoreceptors, and an obvious next question was whether a similar relationship between visual pigment levels and light sensitivity holds also for cones. I decided to test this by switching to ground squirrels, whose retinas possess mainly cones."
"Among other things, I was curious about how cone photoreceptors differ from rod photoreceptors, and so I examined the ground squirrel photoreceptors by electron microscopy. What caught my eye one day were the cone synaptic terminals and the realization that I could follow an occasional process from a synaptic terminal back to its cell of origin. Bipolar cell branches extended to the synaptic terminals, as expected, but I could also identify horizontal cell processes synapsing with the photoreceptors! This was new and exciting."
"Horizontal cells were very much a mystery then; indeed, some investigators thought they were glial cells, but the fact that they made synapses with the photoreceptors clearly indicated they were neurons. What, then, is the neuronal circuitry of the retina, and what is the role of the retinal interneurons—the horizontal and amacrine cells? This became an area of intense interest and study."
"I joined forces with Brian Boycott, and we explored the cellular  and synaptic organization  of the outer and inner plexiform layers of the retina. We found that the photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals make ribbon synapses onto multiple postsynaptic targets, whereas amacrine cells and at least some horizontal cell processes make conventional synapses on single postsynaptic elements. In addition to ground squirrel retinas, we examined monkey, human, cat, frog, and goldfish retinas, and they all showed basic similarities in retinal wiring."
"The next step was to record from the various retinal cells, and that work was undertaken in my laboratory by Frank Werblin, a graduate student with training in electrical engineering. We chose the mudpuppy retina as our animal because of its large cells, and soon Frank had recordings from all the retinal cell types. He confirmed the identity of the recorded cells by staining them intracellularly after the recording—a routine technique today, but then very difficult and on occasion messy."
"More than once, Frank emerged from the darkroom where the experiments were carried out covered with the blue dye we then used. What those experiments told us was that there are both ON-center and OFF-center bipolar cells in the retina and that bipolar cells have a center-surround receptive field organization, with the horizontal cells accounting for the antagonistic surround response. Further, many amacrine cells respond transiently to illumination, giving ON-OFF responses, and appear to be involved in detecting movement."
"These recordings, along with electron microscopic observations on the mudpuppy retina I made, enabled us to suggest the main pathways of information flow through the retina and the roles of the various cells and synapses. Many questions remained, many of which are being explored even today. However, being able to draw a diagram of the functional organization of the retina at that time, however imperfect and incomplete, was immensely satisfying, and it has encouraged, I like to believe, numerous additional studies on retinal mechanisms in the 35 years since."
"Most retinal ganglion cells have the concentric center-surround receptive field organization discussed above for bipolar cells. ON-center and OFFcenter ganglion cells receive input from the corresponding type of bipolar cell. Thus, an ON-center ganglion cell will be depolarized and respond with a barrage of action potentials when a small spot of light is projected onto the middle of its receptive field."
"Likewise, an OFF-center cell will respond to a small dark spot presented to the middle of its receptive field. However, in both types of cell, the response to stimulation of the center is canceled by the response to stimulation of the surround . The surprising implication is that most retinal ganglion cells are not particularly responsive to changes in illumination that include both the receptive field center and the receptive field surround."
"Rather, it appears that the ganglion cells are mainly responsive to differences in illumination that occur within their receptive fields. To illustrate this point, consider the response generated by an OFF-center cell as a light-dark edge crosses its receptive field . Remember that in such a cell, dark in the center of the receptive field causes the cell to depolarize, whereas dark in the surround causes the cell to hyperpolarize."
"In uniform illumination, the center and surround cancel to yield some low level of response . When the edge enters the surround region of the receptive field without encroaching on the center, the dark area has the effect of hyperpolarizing the neuron, leading to a decrease in the cell’s firing rate . As the dark area begins to include the center, however, the partial inhibition by the surround is overcome, and the cell response increases ."
"But when the dark area finally fills the entire surround, the center response is again canceled . Notice that the cell response in this example is only slightly different in uniform light and in uniform dark; the response is modulated mainly by the presence of the light-dark edge in its receptive field. Now let’s consider the output of all the OFF-center ganglion cells that are stimulated by a stationary light-dark edge imaged on the retina."
"The responses will fall into the same four categories illustrated in Figure 9. 24. Thus, the cells that will register the presence of the edge are those with receptive field centers and surrounds that are differentially affected by the light and dark areas."
"The population of cells with receptive field centers “viewing” the light side of the edge will be inhibited . The population of cells with centers “viewing” the dark side of the edge will be excited . In this way, the difference in illumination at a light-dark edge is not faithfully represented by the difference in the output of ganglion cells on either side of the edge."
"Instead, the center-surround organization of the receptive fields leads to a neural response that emphasizes the contrast at light-dark edges. There are many visual illusions involving the perception of light level. The organization of ganglion cell receptive fields suggests an explanation for the illusion shown in Figure 9."
"25. Even though the two central squares are the same shade of gray, the square on the left background appears darker. Consider the two ON-center receptive fields shown on the gray squares."
"In both cases, the same gray light hits the receptive field center. However, the receptive field on the left has more light in its surround than the receptive field on the right. This will lead to a lower response and may be related to the darker appearance of the left gray square."
"Most ganglion cells in the mammalian retina have a center-surround receptive field with either an ON or an OFF center. They can be further categorized based on their appearance, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. In the macaque monkey retina and human retina, two major types of ganglion cells are distinguished: large M-type ganglion cells and smaller P-type ganglion cells."
"Figure 9. 26 shows the relative sizes of M and P ganglion cells at the same location on the retina. P cells constitute about 90% of the ganglion cell population, M cells constitute about 5%, and the remaining 5% is made up of a variety of nonM-nonP ganglion cell types that are less well characterized."
"The visual response properties of M cells differ from those of P cells in several ways. They have larger receptive fields, they conduct action potentials more rapidly in the optic nerve, and they are more sensitive to lowcontrast stimuli. In addition, M cells respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, while P cells respond with a sustained discharge as long as the stimulus is on ."
We will see in Chapter 10 that the different types of ganglion cells appear to play different roles in visual perception. Color-Opponent Ganglion Cells. Another important distinction between ganglion cell types is that some P cells and nonM-nonP cells are sensitive to differences in the wavelength of light.
"The majority of these color-sensitive neurons are called color-opponent cells, reflecting the fact that the response to one wavelength in the receptive field center is canceled by showing another wavelength in the receptive field surround. Two types of opponency are found, red versus green and blue versus yellow. Consider, for example, a cell with a red ON center and a green OFF surround ."
"The center of the receptive field is fed mainly by red cones; therefore, the cell responds to red light by firing action potentials. Note that even a red light that bathes the entire receptive field is an effective stimulus. However, the response is reduced because red light has some effect on green cones  that feed into the green OFF surround."
"The response to red is only canceled by green light on the surround. Shorthand notation for such a cell is RG, meaning simply that it is excited by red in the receptive field center, and this response is inhibited by green in the surround. What would be the response to white light on the entire receptive field?"
"Because white light contains all visible wavelengths, both center and surround would be equally activated, thereby canceling the response of the cell. Blue-yellow color opponency works the same way. Consider a cell with a blue ON center and a yellow OFF surround ."
"Blue light drives blue cones that feed the receptive field center, while yellow light activates both red and green cones that feed the surround. Again, diffuse blue light would be an effective stimulus for this cell, but yellow on the surround would cancel the response, as would diffuse white light. The lack of color opponency in M cells is accounted for by the fact that both the center and surround of the receptive field receive input from more than one type of cone."
"Perceived color is based on the relative activity of ganglion cells whose receptive field centers receive input from red, green, and blue cones. Demonstrate this to yourself by fixating on the cross in the middle of the red box in Figure 9. 29 for a minute or so."
"This will have the effect of lightadapting some of your red cones. Then look at the white box. The activation of the green cones by the white light is unopposed, and you see a green square."
"Similarly, if you fixate on the blue box, you will see yellow when you shift your gaze to the white box. Thus, it appears that the ganglion cells provide a stream of information to the brain that is involved in the spatial comparison of three different opposing processes: light versus dark, red versus green, and blue versus yellow. One of the important concepts that emerges from our discussion of the retina is the idea of parallel processing in the visual system."
"Here’s why. First, we view the world with not one but two eyes that provide two parallel streams of information. In the central visual system, these streams are compared to give information about depth, the distance of an object from the observer."
"Second, there appear to be independent streams of information about light and dark that arise from the ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cells in each retina. Third, ganglion cells of both ON and OFF varieties have different types of receptive fields and response properties. M cells can detect subtle contrasts over their large receptive fields and are likely to contribute to low-resolution vision."
"P cells have small receptive fields that are well suited for the discrimination of fine detail. P cells and nonM-nonP cells are specialized for the separate processing of red-green and blue-yellow information. In this chapter, we have seen how light emitted by or reflected off objects in space can be imaged by the eye onto the retina."
"Light energy is first converted into membrane potential changes in the mosaic of photoreceptors. It is interesting to note that the transduction mechanism in photoreceptors is very similar to that in olfactory receptor cells, both of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Photoreceptor membrane potential is converted into a chemical signal , which is again converted into membrane potential changes in the postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells."
"This process of electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical signaling repeats again and again, until the presence of light or dark or color is finally converted to a change in the action potential firing frequency of the ganglion cells. The information from the 125 million photoreceptors is funneled into 1 million ganglion cells. In the central retina, particularly the fovea, relatively few photoreceptors feed each ganglion cell, whereas in the peripheral retina, thousands of receptors do."
"Thus, the mapping of visual space onto the array of optic nerve fibers is not uniform. Rather, in “neural space,” there is an overrepresentation of the central few degrees of visual space, and signals from individual cones are more important. This specialization ensures high acuity in central vision but also requires that the eye move to bring the images of objects of interest onto the fovea."
"As we shall see in the next chapter, there is good reason to believe that the different types of information that arise from different types of ganglion cells are, at least in the early stages, processed independently. Parallel streams of information—for example, from the right and left eyes—remain segregated at the first synaptic relay in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The same can be said for the M-cell and P-cell synaptic relays in the LGN."
"In the visual cortex, it appears that parallel paths may process different visual attributes. For example, the distinction in the retina between neurons that do and do not convey information about color is preserved in the visual cortex. In general, each of the more than two-dozen visual cortical areas may be specialized for the analysis of different types of retinal output."
"Although our visual system provides us with a unified picture of the world around us, this picture has multiple facets. Objects we see have shape and color. They have position in space, and sometimes they move."
"For us to see each of these properties, neurons somewhere in the visual system must be sensitive to them. Moreover, because we have two eyes, we actually have two visual images in our head, and somehow they must be merged. In Chapter 9, we saw that in many ways the eye acts like a camera."
"But starting with the retina, the rest of the visual system is far more elaborate, far more interesting, and capable of doing far more than any camera. For example, we saw that the retina does not simply pass along information about the patterns of light and dark that fall on it. Rather, the retina extracts information about different facets of the visual image."
"There are more than 100 million photoreceptors in the retina but only 1 million axons leaving the eye carrying information to the rest of the brain. What we perceive about the world around us, therefore, depends on what information is extracted by the retina and how this information is analyzed and interpreted by the rest of the central nervous system . An example is color."
"There is no such thing as color in the physical world; there is simply a spectrum of visible wavelengths of light that are reflected by objects around us. Based on the information extracted by the three types of cone photoreceptors, however, our brain somehow synthesizes a rainbow of colors and fills our world with it. In this chapter, we explore how the information extracted by the retina is analyzed by the central visual system."
"The pathway serving conscious visual perception includes the lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus and the primary visual cortex, also called area 17, V1, or striate cortex. We will see that the information funneled through this geniculocortical pathway is processed in parallel by neurons specialized for the analysis of different stimulus attributes. The striate cortex then feeds this information to more than two dozen different extrastriate cortical areas in the temporal and parietal lobes, and many of these appear to be specialized for different types of analysis."
"Much of what we know about the central visual system was first worked out in the domestic cat and then extended to the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. The macaque monkey, as it is also called, relies heavily on vision for survival in its habitat, as do we humans. In fact, tests of the performance of this primate’s visual system show that in virtually all respects, it rivals that of humans."
"Thus, although most of this chapter concerns the organization of the macaque visual system, most neuroscientists agree that it approximates very closely the situation in our own brain. Although visual neuroscience cannot yet explain many aspects of visual perception , significant progress has been made in answering a more basic question: How do neurons represent the different facets of the visual world? By examining those stimuli that make different neurons in the visual cortex respond, and how these response properties arise, we begin to see how the brain portrays the visual world around us."
"The neural pathway that leaves the eye, beginning with the optic nerve, is often referred to as the retinofugal projection. The suffix -fugal is from the Latin word meaning “to flee” and is commonly used in neuroanatomy to describe a pathway that is directed away from a structure. Thus, a centrifugal projection goes away from the center, a corticofugal projection goes away from the cortex, and the retinofugal projection goes away from the retina."
"We begin our tour of the central visual system by looking at how the retinofugal projection courses from each eye to the brain stem on each side, and how the task of analyzing the visual world initially is divided among, and organized within, certain structures of the brain stem. Then we focus on the major arm of the retinofugal projection that mediates conscious visual perception. The ganglion cell axons “fleeing” the retina pass through three structures before they form synapses in the brain stem."
"The components of this retinofugal projection are, in order, the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the optic tract . The optic nerves exit the left and right eyes at the optic disks, travel through the fatty tissue behind the eyes in their bony orbits, then pass through holes in the floor of the skull. The optic nerves from both eyes combine to form the optic chiasm , which lies at the base of the brain, just anterior to where the pituitary gland dangles down."
"At the optic chiasm, the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross from one side to the other. The crossing of a fiber bundle from one side of the brain to the other is called a decussation. Because only the axons originating in the nasal retinas cross, we say that a partial decussation of the retinofugal projection occurs at the optic chiasm."
"Following the partial decussation at the optic chiasm, the axons of the retinofugal projections form the optic tracts, which run just under the pia along the lateral surfaces of the diencephalon. To understand the significance of the partial decussation of the retinofugal projection at the optic chiasm, let’s review the concept of the visual field introduced in Chapter 9. The full visual field is the entire region of space  that can be seen with both eyes looking straight ahead."
"Fix your gaze on a point straight ahead. Now imagine a vertical line passing through the fixation point, dividing the visual field into left and right halves. By definition, objects appearing to the left of the midline are in the left visual hemifield, and objects appearing to the right of the midline are in the right visual hemifield ."
"By looking straight ahead with both eyes open and then alternately closing one eye and then the other, you will see that the central portion of both visual hemifields is viewed by both retinas. This region of space is therefore called the binocular visual field. Notice that objects in the binocular region of the left visual hemifield will be imaged on the nasal retina of the left eye and on the temporal retina of the right eye."
"Because the fibers from the nasal portion of the left retina cross to the right side at the optic chiasm, all the information about the left visual hemifield is directed to the right side of the brain. Remember this rule of thumb: Optic nerve fibers cross in the optic chiasm so that the left visual hemifield is “viewed” by the right hemisphere and the right visual hemifield is “viewed” by the left hemisphere. A small number of optic tract axons peel off to form synaptic connections with cells in the hypothalamus, and another 10% or so continue past the thalamus to innervate the midbrain."
But most of them innervate the lateral geniculate nucleus  of the dorsal thalamus. The neurons in the LGN give rise to axons that project to the primary visual cortex. This projection from LGN to cortex is called the optic radiation.
"Lesions anywhere in the retinofugal projection from eye to LGN to visual cortex cause blindness in humans. Therefore, we know that it is this pathway that mediates conscious visual perception . From our knowledge of how the visual world is represented in the retinofugal projection, we can predict the types of perceptual deficits that would result from its destruction at different levels, as might occur from a traumatic injury to the head, a tumor, or an interruption of the blood supply."
"As shown in Figure 10. 5, while a transection of the left optic nerve would render a person blind in the left eye only, a transection of the left optic tract would lead to blindness in the right visual field as viewed through either eye. A midline transection of the optic chiasm would affect only the fibers that cross the midline."
"Because these fibers originate in the nasal portions of both retinas, blindness would result in the regions of the visual field viewed by the nasal retinas, that is, the peripheral visual fields on both sides . Because unique deficits result from lesions at different sites, neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists can locate sites of damage by assessing visual field deficits. Nonthalamic Targets of the Optic Tract."
"As we have said, some retinal ganglion cells send axons to innervate structures other than the LGN. Direct projections to part of the hypothalamus play an important role in synchronizing a variety of biological rhythms, including sleep and wakefulness, with the daily dark-light cycle . Direct projections to part of the midbrain, called the pretectum, control the size of the pupil and certain types of eye movement."
"And about 10% of the ganglion cells in the retina project to a part of the midbrain tectum called the superior colliculus  . While 10% may not sound like much of a projection, bear in mind that in primates, this is about 150,000 neurons, which is equivalent to the total number of retinal ganglion cells in a cat! In fact, the tectum of the midbrain is the major target of the retinofugal projection in all nonmammalian vertebrates . In these vertebrate groups, the superior colliculus is called the optic tectum."
"This is why the projection from the retina to the superior colliculus is often called the retinotectal projection, even in mammals. In the superior colliculus, a patch of neurons activated by a point of light, via indirect connections with motor neurons in the brain stem, commands eye and head movements to bring the image of this point in space onto the fovea. This branch of the retinofugal projection is thereby involved in orienting the eyes in response to new stimuli in the visual periphery."
"We will return to the superior colliculus when we discuss motor systems in Chapter 14. Many of you are familiar with the famous story of David and Goliath, which appears in the Hebrew scriptures . The armies of the Philistines and the Israelites were gathered for battle when Goliath, a Philistine, came forth and challenged the Israelites to settle the dispute by sending out their best man to face him in a fight to the death."
"Goliath, it seems, was a man of great proportions, measuring more than “six cubits” in height. If you consider that a cubit is the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, about 20 inches, this guy was more than 10 feet tall! Goliath was armed to the teeth with body armor, a javelin, and a sword. To face this giant, the Israelites sent David, a young and diminutive shepherd, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones."
"Here’s how the action is described in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible : When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. Now why, you might ask, are we giving a theology lesson in a neuroscience textbook?"
"The answer is that our understanding of the visual pathway offers an explanation, in addition to divine intervention, for why Goliath was at a disadvantage in this battle. Body size is regulated by the secretion of growth hormone from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In some cases, the anterior lobe becomes hypertrophied  and produces excessive amounts of the hormone, resulting in body growth to unusually large proportions."
"Such individuals are called pituitary giants and can measure well over 8 feet tall. Pituitary hypertrophy also disrupts normal vision. Recall that the optic nerve fibers from the nasal retinas cross in the optic chiasm, which butts up against the stalk of the pituitary."
"Any enlargement of the pituitary compresses these crossing fibers and results in a loss of peripheral vision called bitemporal hemianopia, or tunnel vision. We can speculate that David was able to draw close and smite Goliath, because when David raced to the battle line, the pituitary giant had completely lost sight of him. The right and left lateral geniculate nuclei, located in the dorsal thalamus, are the major targets of the two optic tracts."
"Viewed in cross section, each LGN appears to be arranged in six distinct layers of cells . By convention, the layers are numbered 1 through 6, starting with the most ventral layer, layer 1. In three dimensions, the layers of the LGN are arranged like a stack of six pancakes, one on top of the other."
"The pancakes do not lie flat, however; they are bent around the optic tract like a knee joint. This shape explains the name geniculate, from the Latin geniculatus, meaning “like a little knee. ” The LGN is the gateway to the visual cortex and, therefore, to conscious visual perception."
"Let’s explore the structure and function of this thalamic nucleus. LGN neurons receive synaptic input from the retinal ganglion cells, and most geniculate neurons project an axon to primary visual cortex via the optic radiation. The segregation of LGN neurons into layers suggests that different types of retinal information are being kept separate at this synaptic relay, and indeed this is the case: Axons arising from M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells in the two retinas synapse on cells in different LGN layers."
"Recall from our rule of thumb that the right LGN receives information about the left visual field. The left visual field is viewed by both the nasal left retina and the temporal right retina. At the LGN, input from the two eyes is kept separate."
"In the right LGN, the right eye  axons synapse on LGN cells in layers 2, 3, and 5. The left eye  axons synapse on cells in layers 1, 4, and 6 . A closer look at the LGN in Figure 10."
"7 reveals that the two ventral layers, 1 and 2, contain larger neurons, and the four more dorsal layers, 3 through 6, contain smaller cells. The ventral layers are therefore called magnocellular LGN layers, and the dorsal layers are called parvocellular LGN layers. Recall from Chapter 9 that ganglion cells in the retina may also be classified into magnocellular and parvocellular groups."
"As it turns out, P-type ganglion cells in the retina project exclusively to the parvocellular LGN, and M-type ganglion cells in the retina project entirely to the magnocellular LGN. In addition to the neurons in the six principal layers of the LGN, numerous tiny neurons also lie just ventral to each layer. Cells in these koniocellular layers  receive input from the nonM-nonP types of retinal ganglion cells and also project to visual cortex."
"Note that the koniocellular layers are not uniquely numbered, because historically, the six thick layers were numbered before cells in the koniocellular layers were discovered. In Chapter 9, we saw that in the retina, M-type, P-type, and nonM-nonP ganglion cells respond differently to light and color. In the LGN, the different information derived from the three categories of retinal ganglion cells from the two eyes remains segregated."
"The anatomical organization of the LGN supports the idea that the retina gives rise to streams of information that are processed in parallel. This organization is summarized in. By inserting a microelectrode into the LGN, it is possible to study the action potential discharges of geniculate neurons in response to visual stimuli, just as was done in the retina."
"The surprising conclusion of such studies is that the visual receptive fields of LGN neurons are almost identical to those of the ganglion cells that feed them. For example, magnocellular LGN neurons have relatively large center-surround receptive fields, respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a transient burst of action potentials, and are insensitive to differences in wavelength. All in all, they are just like M-type ganglion cells."
"Likewise, parvocellular LGN cells, like P-type retinal ganglion cells, have relatively small center-surround receptive fields and respond to stimulation of their receptive field centers with a sustained increase in the frequency of action potentials; many of them exhibit color opponency. Receptive fields of cells in the koniocellular layers are centersurround and have either light/dark or color opponency. Within all layers of the LGN, the neurons are activated by only one eye  and ON-center and OFF-center cells are intermixed."
"What makes the similarity of LGN and ganglion cell receptive fields so surprising is that the retina is not the main source of synaptic input to the LGN. The major input, constituting about 80% of the excitatory synapses, comes from primary visual cortex. Thus, one might reasonably expect that this corticofugal feedback pathway would significantly alter the qualities of the visual responses recorded in the LGN."
"So far, however, a role for this massive input has not been clearly identified. The LGN also receives synaptic inputs from neurons in the brain stem whose activity is related to alertness and attentiveness . Have you ever “seen” a flash of light when you are startled in a dark room?"
"This perceived flash might be a result of the direct activation of LGN neurons by this pathway. Usually, however, this input does not directly evoke action potentials in LGN neurons. But it can powerfully modulate the magnitude of LGN responses to visual stimuli."
"Thus, the LGN is more than a simple relay from retina to cortex; it is the first site in the ascending visual pathway where what we see is influenced by how we feel. The LGN has a single major synaptic target: primary visual cortex. Recall from Chapter 7 that the cortex may be divided into a number of distinct areas based on their connections and cytoarchitecture."
"Primary visual cortex is Brodmann’s area 17 and is located in the occipital lobe of the primate brain. Much of area 17 lies on the medial surface of the hemisphere, surrounding the calcarine fissure . Other terms used interchangeably to describe the primary visual cortex are V1 and striate cortex."
"We have seen that the axons of different types of retinal ganglion cells synapse on anatomically segregated neurons in the LGN. In this section, we look at the anatomy of the striate cortex and trace the connections different LGN cells make with cortical neurons. In a later section, we explore how this information is analyzed by cortical neurons."
"As we did in the LGN, in striate cortex we’ll see a close correlation between structure and function. The projection starting in the retina and extending to LGN and V1 illustrates a general organizational feature of the central visual system called retinotopy. Retinotopy is an organization whereby neighboring cells in the retina feed information to neighboring places in their target structures—in this case, the LGN and striate cortex."
"In this way, the two-dimensional surface of the retina is mapped onto the two-dimensional surface of the subsequent structures . There are three important points to remember about retinotopy. First, the mapping of the visual field onto a retinotopically organized structure is often distorted, because visual space is not sampled uniformly by the cells in the retina."
"Recall from Chapter 9 that there are many more ganglion cells with receptive fields in or near the fovea than in the periphery. Thus, the representation of the visual field is distorted in striate cortex: The central few degrees of the visual field are overrepresented, or magnified, in the retinotopic map . The second point to remember is that a discrete point of light can activate many cells in the retina, and often many more cells in the target structure, due to the overlap of receptive fields."
"The image of a point of light on the retina actually activates a large population of cortical neurons; every neuron that contains that point in its receptive field is potentially activated. Thus, when the retina is stimulated by a point of light, the activity in striate cortex is a broad distribution with a peak at the corresponding retinotopic location. Finally, don’t be misled by the word “map."
"” There are no pictures in the primary visual cortex for a little person in our brain to look at. While it’s true that the arrangement of connections establishes a mapping between the retina and V1, perception is based on the brain’s interpretation of distributed patterns of activity, not literal snapshots of the world. The neocortex in general, and striate cortex in particular, have neuronal cell bodies arranged into about a half-dozen layers."
"These layers can be seen clearly in a Nissl stain of the cortex, which, as described Chapter 2, leaves a deposit of dye  in the soma of each neuron. Starting at the white matter , the cell layers are named by Roman numerals VI, V, IV, III, and II. Layer I, just under the pia mater, is largely devoid of neurons and consists almost entirely of axons and dendrites of cells in other layers ."
"The full thickness of the striate cortex from white matter to pia is about 2 mm, the height of the lowercase letter m. As Figure 10. 12 shows, describing the lamination of striate cortex as a six-layer scheme is somewhat misleading."
"There are actually at least nine distinct layers of neurons. To maintain Brodmann’s convention that neocortex has six layers, however, neuroanatomists combine three sublayers into layer IV, labeled IVA, IVB, and IVC. Layer IVC is further divided into two tiers called IVC and IVC."
"The anatomical segregation of neurons into layers suggests that there is a division of labor in the cortex, similar to what we saw in the LGN. We can learn a lot about how the cortex handles visual information by examining the structure and connections of its different layers. The Cells of Different Layers."
"Many different neuronal shapes have been identified in striate cortex, but here we focus on two principal types, defined by the appearance of their dendritic trees . Spiny stellate cells are small neurons with spine-covered dendrites that radiate out from the cell body . They are seen primarily in the two tiers of layer IVC."
Outside layer IVC are many pyramidal cells. These neurons are also covered with spines and are characterized by a single thick apical dendrite that branches as it ascends toward the pia mater and by multiple basal dendrites that extend horizontally. Notice that a pyramidal cell in one layer may have dendrites extending into other layers.
"It is important to remember that only pyramidal cells send axons out of striate cortex to form connections with other parts of the brain. The axons of stellate cells make local connections only within the cortex. In addition to the spiny neurons, inhibitory neurons, which lack spines, are sprinkled in all cortical layers as well."
"These neurons form only local connections. The distinct lamination of the striate cortex is reminiscent of the layers we saw in the LGN. In the LGN, every layer receives retinal afferents and sends efferents to the visual cortex."
"In the visual cortex, the situation is different; only a subset of the layers receives input from the LGN or sends output to a different cortical or subcortical area. Axons from the LGN terminate in several different cortical layers, with the largest number going to layer IVC. We’ve seen that the output of the LGN is divided into streams of information, for example, from the magnocellular and parvocellular layers serving the right and left eyes."
"These streams remain anatomically segregated in layer IVC. Magnocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC, and parvocellular LGN neurons project to layer IVC. Imagine that the two tiers of layer IVC are pancakes, stacked one  on top of the other ."
"Because the input from the LGN to the cortex is arranged topographically, we see that layer IVC contains two overlapping retinotopic maps, one from the magnocellular LGN  and the other from the parvocellular LGN . Koniocellular LGN axons follow a different path, bypassing layer IV to make synapses in layers II and III. Ocular Dominance Columns."
How are the left eye and right eye LGN inputs segregated when they reach layer IVC of striate cortex? The answer was provided by a ground-breaking experiment performed in the early 1970s at Harvard Medical School by neuroscientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. They injected a radioactive amino acid into one eye of a monkey .
"This amino acid was incorporated into proteins by the ganglion cells, and the proteins were transported down the ganglion cell axons into the LGN . Here, the radioactive proteins spilled out of the ganglion cell axon terminals and were taken up by nearby LGN neurons. But not all LGN cells took up the radioactive material; only those cells that were postsynaptic to the inputs from the injected eye incorporated the labeled protein."
"These cells then transported the radioactive proteins to their axon terminals in layer IVC of striate cortex. The location of the radioactive axon terminals was visualized by first placing a film of emulsion over thin sections of striate cortex and later developing the emulsion like a photograph, a process called autoradiography . The resulting collection of silver grains on the film marked the location of the radioactive LGN inputs."
"In sections cut perpendicular to the cortical surface, Hubel and Wiesel observed that the distribution of axon terminals relaying information from the injected eye was not continuous in layer IVC, but rather was split up into a series of equally spaced patches, each about 0. 5 mm wide . These patches were termed ocular dominance columns."
"In later experiments, the cortex was sectioned tangentially, parallel to layer IV. This revealed that the left eye and right eye inputs to layer IV are laid out as a series of alternating bands, like the stripes of a zebra . Innervation of Other Cortical Layers from Layer IVC."
"Most intracortical connections extend perpendicular to the cortical surface along radial lines that run across the layers, from white matter to layer I. This pattern of radial connections maintains the retinotopic organization established in layer IV. Therefore, a cell in layer VI, for example, receives information from the same part of the retina as does a cell above it in layer IV ."
"However, the axons of some layer III pyramidal cells extend collateral branches that make horizontal connections within layer III . Radial and horizontal connections play different roles in the analysis of the visual world, as we’ll see later in the chapter. Layer IVC stellate cells project axons radially up mainly to layers IVB and III where, for the first time, information from the left eye and right eye begins to mix ."
"Whereas all layer IVC neurons receive only monocular input, most neurons in layers II and III receive binocular input coming from both eyes. Even so, there continues to be considerable anatomical segregation of the magnocellular and parvocellular processing streams. Layer IVC, which receives magnocellular LGN input, projects mainly to cells in layer IVB."
"Layer IVC, which receives parvocellular LGN input, projects mainly to layer III. In layers III and IVB, an axon may form synapses with the dendrites of pyramidal cells of all layers. Striate Cortex Outputs."
"As previously mentioned, the pyramidal cells send axons out of striate cortex into the white matter. The pyramidal cells in different layers innervate different structures. Layer II, III, and IVB pyramidal cells send their axons to other cortical areas."
Layer V pyramidal cells send axons all the way down to the superior colliculus and pons. Layer VI pyramidal cells give rise to the massive axonal projection back to the LGN . Pyramidal cell axons in all layers also branch and form local connections in the cortex.
"As we have seen, layers II and III play a key role in visual processing, providing most of the information that leaves V1 for other cortical areas. Anatomical studies suggest that the V1 output comes from two distinct populations of neurons in the superficial layers. When striate cortex is stained to reveal the presence of cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme used for cell metabolism, the stain is not uniformly distributed in layers II and III."
"Rather, the cytochrome oxidase staining in cross sections of striate cortex appears as a colonnade, a series of pillars at regular intervals, running the full thickness of layers II and III and also in layers V and VI . When the cortex is sliced tangentially through layer III, these pillars appear like the spots of a leopard . These pillars of cytochrome oxidase-rich neurons have come to be called blobs."
"The blobs are in rows, each blob centered on an ocular dominance stripe in layer IV. Between the blobs are “interblob” regions. The blobs receive direct LGN input from the koniocellular layers, as well as parvocellular and magnocellular input from layer IVC of striate cortex."
"Beginning in the early 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel were the first to systematically explore the physiology of striate cortex with microelectrodes. They were students of Stephen Kuffler, who was then at Johns Hopkins University and later moved with them to Harvard. They extended Kuffler’s innovative methods of receptive field mapping to the central visual pathways."
"After showing that LGN neurons behave much like retinal ganglion cells, they turned their attention to striate cortex, initially in cats and later in monkeys. The work that continues today on the physiology of striate cortex is built on the solid foundation provided by Hubel and Wiesel’s pioneering studies. Their contributions to our understanding of the cerebral cortex were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 1981."
"By and large, the receptive fields of neurons in layer IVC are similar to the magnocellular and parvocellular LGN neurons providing their input. This means they are generally small monocular center-surround receptive fields. In layer IVC the neurons are insensitive to the wavelength of light, whereas in layer IVC the neurons exhibit center-surround color opponency."
"Outside layer IVC, new receptive field characteristics, not observed in the retina or LGN, are found. We will explore these in some depth, because they provide clues about the role V1 plays in visual processing and perception. Binocularity."
Each neuron in layers IVC and IVC receives afferents from a layer of the LGN representing either eye. Monocular neurons from either eye are also clumped together in V1 rather than randomly intermixed. This accounts for ocular dominance columns that can be visualized in layer IVC with autoradiography.
"As we have already seen, the axons leaving layer IVC diverge and innervate more superficial cortical layers. As a consequence of the divergence, there is a mixing of inputs from the two eyes . Microelectrode recordings confirm this anatomical fact; most neurons in layers superficial to IVC are binocular, responding to light in either eye."
"We say that the neurons have binocular receptive fields, meaning that they actually have two receptive fields, one in the ipsilateral and one in the contralateral eye. The construction of binocular receptive fields is essential in binocular animals, such as humans. Without binocular neurons, we would probably be unable to use the inputs from both eyes to form a single image of the world around us."
"Retinotopy is preserved because the two receptive fields of a binocular neuron are precisely placed on the retinas such that they are “looking” at the same point in space. We still speak of ocular dominance columns in superficial cortical layers. However, now instead of the sharp monocular columns of layer IVC, there are patches of neurons that are more strongly driven by one eye than the other , even though they are binocular."
"Orientation Selectivity. Most of the receptive fields in the retina, LGN, and layer IVC are circular and give their greatest response to a spot of light matched in size to the receptive field center. Outside layer IVC, we encounter cells that no longer follow this pattern."
"While small spots can elicit a response from many cortical neurons, it is usually possible to produce a much greater response with other stimuli. Rather by accident, Hubel and Wiesel found that many neurons in V1 respond best to an elongated bar of light moving across their receptive fields. But the orientation of the bar is critical."
The greatest response is given to a bar with a particular orientation; perpendicular bars generally elicit much weaker responses . Neurons having this type of response are said to exhibit orientation selectivity. Most of the V1 neurons outside layer IVC  are orientation selective.
"The optimal orientation for a neuron can be any angle around the clock. If V1 neurons can have any optimal orientation, you might wonder whether the orientation selectivity of nearby neurons is related. From the earliest work of Hubel and Wiesel, the answer to this question was an emphatic yes."
"As a microelectrode is advanced radially  from one layer to the next, the preferred orientation remains the same for all the selective neurons encountered from layer II down through layer VI. Hubel and Wiesel called such a radial column of cells an orientation column. As an electrode passes tangentially  through the cortex in a single layer, the preferred orientation progressively shifts."
"We now know, from the use of a technique called optical imaging, that there is a mosaiclike pattern of optimal orientations in striate cortex . If an electrode is passed at certain angles through this mosaic, the preferred orientation rotates like the sweep of the minute hand of a clock, from the top of the hour to ten past to twenty past, and so on . If the electrode is moved at other angles, more sudden shifts in preferred orientation occur."
"Hubel and Wiesel found that a complete 180° shift in preferred orientation required a traverse of about 1 mm, on average, within layer III. The analysis of stimulus orientation appears to be one of the most important functions of striate cortex. Orientation-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object shape."
Direction Selectivity. Many V1 receptive fields exhibit direction selectivity; they respond when a bar of light at the optimal orientation moves perpendicular to the orientation in one direction but not in the opposite direction. Direction-selective cells in V1 are a subset of the cells that are orientation selective.
"Figure 10. 22 shows how a direction-selective cell responds to a moving stimulus. Notice that the cell responds to an elongated stimulus swept across the receptive field, but only in a particular direction of movement."
Sensitivity to the direction of stimulus motion is a hallmark of neurons receiving input from the magnocellular layers of the LGN. Direction-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object motion. Simple and Complex Receptive Fields.
"Neurons in the LGN have antagonistic center-surround receptive fields, and this organization accounts for the responses of neurons to visual stimuli. For example, a small spot in the center of the receptive field may yield a much stronger response than a larger spot also covering the antagonistic surround. What do we know about the inputs to V1 neurons that might account for binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity in their receptive fields?"
"Binocularity is easy; we have seen that binocular neurons receive afferents from both eyes. The mechanisms underlying orientation and direction selectivity have proven more difficult to elucidate. Many orientation-selective neurons have a receptive field elongated along a particular axis, with an ON-center or OFF-center region flanked on one or both sides by an antagonistic surround ."
This linear arrangement of ON and OFF areas is analogous to the concentric antagonistic areas seen in retinal and LGN receptive fields. One gets the impression that the cortical neurons receive a converging input from three or more LGN cells with receptive fields that are aligned along one axis . Hubel and Wiesel called neurons of this type simple cells.
"The segregation of ON and OFF regions is a defining property of simple cells, and it is because of this receptive field structure that they are orientation selective. Other orientation selective neurons in V1 do not have distinct ON and OFF regions and are therefore not considered simple cells. Hubel and Wiesel called most of these complex cells, because their receptive fields appeared to be more complex than those of simple cells."
"Complex cells give ON and OFF responses to stimuli throughout the receptive field . Hubel and Wiesel proposed that complex cells are constructed from the input of several like-oriented simple cells. However, this remains a matter of debate."
"Simple and complex cells are typically binocular and sensitive to stimulus orientation. While less is known about the mechanism, many are also direction selective. In general, they are relatively insensitive to the wavelength of light, although color sensitivity is sometimes observed."
"Blob Receptive Fields. The old adage says, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This idea appropriately describes the connection between structure and function in the brain."
"We have seen repeatedly in the visual system that when two nearby structures label differently with some anatomical technique, there is good reason to suspect the neurons in the structures are functionally different. For example, we have seen how the distinctive layers of the LGN segregate different types of input. Similarly, the lamination of striate cortex correlates with differences in the receptive fields of the neurons."
"The presence of the distinct cytochrome oxidase blobs outside layer IV of striate cortex immediately raises the question of whether the neurons in the blobs respond differently from interblob neurons. The answer is clearly yes. The neurons in the interblob areas have some or all of the properties we discussed above: binocularity, orientation selectivity, and direction selectivity."
"They are both simple cells and complex cells and generally are not wavelength sensitive. Most blob cells, on the other hand, are wavelength sensitive and monocular, and they lack orientation and direction selectivity. The blobs receive input directly from the koniocellular layers of the LGN and magnocellular and parvocellular input via layer IVC."
The visual responses of blob cells most resemble those of the koniocellular and parvocellular input. The receptive fields of most blob neurons are circular. Some have the color-opponent center-surround organization observed in the parvocellular and koniocellular layers of the LGN.
"Other blob cell receptive fields have red-green or blue-yellow color opponency in the center of their receptive fields, with no surround regions at all. Still other cells have both a coloropponent center and a color-opponent surround; they are called doubleopponent cells. For present purposes, the most important thing to remember about blobs is that they contain the great majority of color-sensitive neurons outside layer IVC."
"Thus, the blob channels appear to be specialized for the analysis of object color. Without them, we might be color-blind. Most of what we know about the response properties of neurons in the visual system, and every other system in the brain, has been learned from intracellular and extracellular recordings with microelectrodes."
"These recordings give precise information about the activity of one or a few cells. However, unless one inserts thousands of electrodes, it is not possible to observe patterns of activity across large populations of neurons. What if we could simultaneously record signals from thousands of neurons simply by aiming a camera at the brain’s surface?"
"Incredibly, one can observe brain activity with this optical recording approach, and the resulting images have yielded new insight about the organization of the cerebral cortex. In one version of optical recording, a voltage-sensitive dye is applied to the surface of the brain. The molecules in the dye bind to cell membranes, and they change their optical properties in proportion to variations in membrane potential."
"The change is detected with either an array of photodetectors or a video camera. If this technique is used to record from a single neuron, the output of the optical detector is similar to an intracellular recording. In recordings from the cerebral cortex, the activity of individual neurons cannot be resolved, and the optical signal represents a summation of the changes in membrane potential of the neurons and glial cells in an area about 100 μm across."
"A second way to optically study cortical activity is to image intrinsic signals. When neurons are active, numerous changes occur in the neurons themselves and in the surrounding tissue. Examples of such changes are ion movement, neurotransmitter release, and alterations in blood volume and oxygenation."
"Because these factors are correlated with the level of neural activity and they have  effects on the reflection of light from the brain, they are called intrinsic signals for optical recording. Thus, when intrinsic signals are used to study brain activity, membrane potentials or action potentials are not directly measured. To record intrinsic signals, light is projected onto the brain, and a video camera records the reflected light."
"With the wavelengths of light usually used for illumination, the intrinsic signal is dominated by changes associated with activity-dependent increases in blood volume or blood oxygen saturation. One disadvantage of this technique is that its reliance on slow vascular changes makes it incapable of the millisecond temporal resolution possible with voltage-sensitive dyes. Figure A shows the vasculature in a portion of primary visual cortex."
"Figure B shows ocular dominance columns in the same patch of striate cortex obtained by imaging areas in which blood flow changes occurred during visual stimulation. This figure is actually a subtraction of two images— one made when only the right eye was visually stimulated, minus another when only the left eye was stimulated. Consequently, the dark bands represent cells dominated by the left eye, and the light bands represent cells dominated by the right eye."
Figure C is a color-coded representation of preferred orientation in the same patch of striate cortex. Four different optical images were recorded while bars of light at four different orientations were swept across the visual field. Each location in the figure is colored according to the orientation that produced the greatest response at each location on the brain .
"Consistent with earlier results obtained with electrodes , in some regions, the orientation changes progressively along a straight line. However, the optical recording technique reveals that cortical organization based on orientation is much more complex than an idealized pattern of parallel “columns. ” The anatomy and physiology of the central visual pathways, from retina to striate cortex, are consistent with the idea that there are several channels that process visual input in parallel."
Each one appears to be specialized for the analysis of different facets of the visual scene. Dr. Margaret Livingstone and her colleagues at Harvard University have explored the fascinating correspondence between the organization of visual pathways and the receptive field properties of neurons .
"On the basis of anatomy and physiology, we can distinguish a magnocellular pathway, a parvo-interblob pathway, and a blob pathway. These pathways are summarized in Figure 10. 25."
"In addition to this segregation into parallel pathways, there appears to be modular processing in V1 based on retinotopy and the organization into ocular dominance columns, orientation columns, and blobs. Parallel Pathways. The magnocellular pathway begins with M-type ganglion cells of the retina."
"These cells project axons to the magnocellular layers of the LGN. These layers project to layer IVC of striate cortex, which in turn projects to layer IVB. The pyramidal cells in layer IVB have binocular receptive fields of the simple and complex types."
"They are orientation selective, and many are direction selective. They are generally not wavelength sensitive. Because this pathway contains neurons with transient responses, relatively large receptive fields, and the highest percentage of direction- selective neurons, it is thought to be involved in the analysis of object motion and the guidance of motor actions."
"The parvo-interblob pathway originates with P-type ganglion cells of the retina, which project to the parvocellular layers of the LGN. The parvocellular LGN sends axons to layer IVC of striate cortex, which project to layer II and III interblob regions. These neurons are not generally direction selective or wavelength sensitive."
"The binocular receptive fields are orientation selective and simple or complex. Neurons in this pathway have the smallest orientation-selective receptive fields, suggesting that they are involved in the analysis of fine object shape. The origin of the blob pathway is more mixed than that of the magnocellular and parvo-interblob pathways."
Unique input to the blob pathway arises from the subset of ganglion cells that are neither M-type cells nor P-type cells. These nonM-nonP cells project to the koniocellular layers of the LGN. The koniocellular LGN projects directly to the cytochrome oxidase blobs in layers II and III.
"The blobs are a site of convergence of parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular inputs. Typical receptive fields in the blobs are center-surround and color-opponent. They are often monocular and lack orientation selectivity."
"The uniquely high incidence of wavelength sensitivity in the blobs suggests that the neurons are involved in the analysis of object color. While parallel pathways are a compelling feature of the visual system, it is important to note that they are not “pure. ” There is some mixing both within V1 and beyond, resulting in the interaction of signals from the magnocellular, parvo-interblob, and blob pathways."
"At present, we do not know whether this mixing is useless “contamination” that degrades information transmission within pathways or the source of valuable integration of different visual attributes. Cortical Modules. Each point in the visual world is analyzed by thousands of cortical neurons."
"The retinotopic organization of the projections from retina to LGN to the primary visual cortex ensures that all the neurons analyzing a point in visual space are within a circumscribed patch of the cortex. Hubel and Wiesel showed that the image of a point in space falls within the receptive fields of neurons within a 2  2 mm region of layer III. For a complete analysis, this 2  2 mm patch of active neurons must include representatives from each of the processing channels from right and left eyes."
"Fortunately, a 2  2 mm chunk of cortex would contain two complete sets of ocular dominance columns, 16 blobs, and, in the cells between blobs, a complete sampling  of all 180° of possible orientations. Thus, Hubel and Wiesel argued that a 2  2 mm chunk of striate cortex is both necessary and sufficient to analyze the image of a point in space, necessary because its removal would leave a blind spot for this point in the visual field and sufficient because it contains all the neural machinery required to analyze the participation of this point in oriented and/or colored contours viewed through either eye. Such a unit of brain tissue has come to be called a cortical module."
"Striate cortex is constructed from perhaps a thousand cortical modules, and one is shown in Figure 10. 26. We can think of a visual scene being simultaneously processed by these modules, each “looking” at a portion of the scene."
"Just remember that the modules are an idealization. Optical images of V1 activity reveal that the regions of striate cortex responding to different eyes and orientations are not nearly as regular as the “icecube model” in Figure 10 suggests. In thinking about what factors led to my favorite discoveries, I recall that there always seemed to be a combination of luck and having the right question percolating around in my mind."
"David Hubel and I worked out the interlacing connectivity between the different subdivisions of V1 and V2 because we had been recording from the V1 blobs and were very curious about their connectivity. The lucky part was that a colleague gave us a very large number of squirrel monkeys—otherwise, we would not have had enough money to do the study. We started looking at the roles of the magno and parvo systems in perception after seeing Patrick Cavanagh’s astonishing demonstration of the slowing down of motion perception at equiluminance ."
"On seeing the demo, I immediately said, “That’s because the magno system is color-blind. ” David Hubel replied,“That’s ridiculous; if that were the case, then stereopsis  should be color-blind. ” So we looked at some stereograms at equiluminance, and sure enough, we couldn’t see stereopsis at equiluminance."
"Each time I thought we had settled the hypothesis that magno functions should be diminished at equiluminance, David would object, saying that some other visual task should be similarly affected. After 2 years of arguing, and doing every experiment he could think up, we finally convinced ourselves that it was the case, and published a very long paper on the parallel processing of form, color, motion, and depth. We looked at all kinds of visual functions to see which ones were diminished at equiluminance, to see whether they might be carried selectively by the magno system, and one of the things we found that was adversely affected at equiluminance was reading."
"This got me interested in looking at dyslexia. People with dyslexia often complain that ordinary text seems jittery, just like what non-dyslexics experience when reading equiluminant text. I got lucky in telling this idea to Al Galaburda because he turned out to have an entire collection of dyslexic and control brains, and this collaboration led to our developing a theory  about the etiology of dyslexia."
"Whenever I would give scientific talks about the parallel processing of form, color, motion, and depth, I would use works of art to illustrate the points about how various visual functions would disappear at equiluminance, because a lot of op art uses just this principle. I found that people in the audience were often more interested in the art than the science, so I started putting more art and less science in my lectures. I also started collecting the best examples I could find of works of art that illustrated various points in my lectures."
"After a while, I had so many of them that I started writing an article, thinking I would publish it in Scientific American, but I had collected so many examples that it turned into a book. An editor I was working with on the book told me that although it was obvious I knew a lot about art, it was equally obvious that I knew nothing about art history, and he recommended I read an art history book. So I did, and when I got to the Renaissance, the author urged the reader to look carefully at the Mona Lisa and observe how lifelike she seemed, and how her expression seemed to change."
"I noticed that her expression did change, but it changed systematically with my gaze direction. I realized this was because her smile was blurry and therefore more visible to my low-resolution peripheral vision than to my high-acuity central vision. From my work on dyslexics, I got interested in the possibility that artistic talent might have some biological basis."
"An astonishing number of talented artists, musicians, actors, and computer programmers contacted me and told me that they were dyslexic. It became clear that some of them were so talented that their success couldn’t be simply compensation for being bad at reading, and the idea that something that might be a disability in one realm of life might be an asset in another was forced upon me. I began thinking that one small component of artistic talent in dyslexics might be poor depth perception, because a painter’s job is to flatten the 3-D world onto a flat canvas, and I started looking for evidence of poor depth perception in artists."
"Mostly I looked at photographs of famous artists, because you can legitimately diagnose strabismus, which would result in stereoblindness, from photographs. During vacation, I noticed that all four of the Rembrandt self-portraits in the Louvre look walleyed. I looked at a very large number of Rembrandt selfportraits, but I couldn’t see any pattern as to which eye deviated outward, which you would expect if Rembrandt had had one bad eye."
"One of my students, Bevil Conway, is himself a stereoblind artist, and he pointed out that we should look at etchings and paintings separately, because etchings are mirror image reversed from the plate. Then we saw the pattern! So for me, Pasteur’s maxim that luck favors the prepared mind has repeatedly been true. Striate cortex is called V1, for “visual area one,” because it is the first cortical area to receive information from the LGN."
"Beyond V1 lie another two dozen distinct areas of cortex, each of which contains a representation of the visual world. The contributions to vision of these extrastriate areas are still being vigorously debated. However, the emerging picture is that there are two large-scale cortical streams of visual processing, one stretching dorsally from striate cortex toward the parietal lobe and the other projecting ventrally toward the temporal lobe ."
"The dorsal stream appears to serve the analysis of visual motion and the visual control of action. The ventral stream is thought to be involved in the perception of the visual world and the recognition of objects. These processing streams have primarily been studied in the macaque monkey brain, where recordings from single neurons can be made."
"However, functional magnetic resonance imaging  research has begun to identify areas in the human brain that have properties analogous to brain areas in the macaque . The dorsal and ventral streams in extrastriate cortex are related to the magnocellular, parvo-interblob, and blob pathways in V1. As we will see below, the properties of dorsal stream neurons are most similar to magnocellular neurons in V1, and ventral stream neurons have properties combining features of parvo-interblob and blob cells in V1."
"It appears to be a reasonable approximation to view the dorsal stream as an extension of the V1 magnocellular pathway and the ventral stream as an extension of V1 parvo-interblob and blob pathways. However, each extrastriate stream receives some amount of input from all the pathways that are segregated in the primary visual cortex. Thus, the extrastriate streams appear to be dominated by input from particular V1 pathways rather than exclusive extensions of them."
"The cortical areas composing the dorsal stream are not arranged in a strict serial hierarchy, but there does appear to be a progression of areas in which more complex or specialized visual representations develop. Projections from V1 extend to areas designated V2 and V3, but we will skip farther ahead in the dorsal stream. Area MT."
"In an area known as V5 or MT , strong evidence indicates that specialized processing of object motion takes place. Area MT receives retinotopically organized input from a number of other cortical areas, such as V2 and V3, and it also is directly innervated by cells in layer IVB of striate cortex. Recall that in layer IVB the cells have relatively large receptive fields, transient responses to light, and direction selectivity."
"Neurons in area MT have large receptive fields that respond to stimulus movement in a narrow range of directions. Area MT is most notable for the fact that almost all the cells are direction-selective, unlike areas earlier in the dorsal stream, or anywhere in the ventral stream. The neurons in MT also respond to types of motion, such as drifting spots of light, that are not good stimuli for cells in other areas—it appears that the motion of the objects is more important than their structure."
"Further specialization for motion processing is evident in the organization of MT. This cortical area is arranged into direction-of-motion columns analogous to the orientation columns in V1. Presumably, the perception of movement at any point in space depends on a comparison of the activity across columns spanning a full 360º range of preferred directions."
"William Newsome and his colleagues at Stanford University have shown that weak electrical stimulation in area MT of the macaque monkey appears to alter the perceived direction in which small dots of light move. For example, if electrical stimulation is applied to cells in a direction column preferring rightward movement, the monkey makes behavioral decisions suggesting that it has perceived motion in that direction. The artificial motion signal from electrical stimulation in MT appears to combine with visual motion input."
"The fact that the monkey behaviorally reports a perceived direction of motion based on the combination suggests that MT activity plays an important role in motion perception. Dorsal Areas and Motion Processing. Beyond area MT, in the parietal lobe, are areas with additional types of specialized movement sensitivity."
"For example, in an area known as MST, there are cells selective for linear motion , radial motion , and circular motion . We do not know how the visual system makes use of neurons with complex motion-sensitive properties in MST or of the “simpler” direction-selective cells in V1, MT, and other areas. However, three roles have been proposed: Navigation: As we move through our environment, objects stream past our eyes, and the direction and speed of objects in our peripheral vision provide valuable information that can be used for navigation."
"Directing eye movements: Our ability to sense and analyze motion must also be used when we follow objects with our eyes and when we quickly move our eyes to objects in our peripheral vision that catch our attention. Motion perception: We live in a world filled with motion, and survival sometimes depends on our interpretation of moving objects. Striking evidence that cortical areas in the vicinity of MT and MST are critical for motion perception in humans comes from extremely rare cases in which brain lesions selectively disrupt the perception of motion."
"The clearest case was reported in 1983 by Josef Zihl and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry in Munich, Germany. Zihl studied a woman who experienced a stroke at the age of 43, bilaterally damaging portions of extrastriate visual cortex known to be particularly responsive to motion . Although some ill effects of the stroke were evident, such as difficulty naming objects, neuropsychological testing showed the patient to be generally normal and to have relatively normal vision, except for one serious deficit: She appeared to be incapable of visually perceiving motion."
"Before you decide that not seeing motion would be a minor impairment, imagine what it would be like to see the world in snapshots. Zihl’s patient complained that when she poured coffee into a cup, it appeared at one moment to be frozen at the bottom of the cup and then suddenly it had filled the cup and covered the table. More ominously, she had trouble crossing the street—one moment she would perceive cars to be in the distance, and the next moment they would be right next to her."
"Clearly, this seemingly minor loss of motion perception had profound ramifications for the woman’s lifestyle. The implication of this case is that motion perception may be based on specialized mechanisms located beyond striate cortex in the dorsal stream. In parallel with the dorsal stream, a progression of areas from V1, V2, and V3 running ventrally toward the temporal lobes appears specialized for the analysis of visual attributes other than motion."
Area V4. One of the most-studied areas in the ventral stream is area V4 . V4 receives input from the blob and interblob regions of striate cortex via a relay in V2.
"Neurons in area V4 have larger receptive fields than cells in striate cortex, and many of the cells are both orientation selective and color selective. Although there is a good deal of ongoing speculation concerning the function of V4, this area appears to be important for both shape perception and color perception. If this area is damaged in monkeys, perceptual deficits involving both shape and color result."
"A rare clinical syndrome in humans known as achromatopsia is characterized by a partial or complete loss of color vision despite the presence of normal functional cones in the retina. People with this condition describe their world as drab, consisting of only shades of gray. Imagine how unappetizing a gray banana would be! Because achromatopsia is associated with cortical damage in the occipital and temporal lobes, without damage to V1, the LGN, or the retina, the syndrome suggests that there is specialized color processing in the ventral stream."
"Consistent with the coexistence of colorsensitive and shape-sensitive cells in the ventral stream, achromatopsia is usually accompanied by deficits in form perception. Some researchers have proposed that V4 is a particularly critical area for color and form perception, but whether the lesions associated with achromatopsia correspond to a human V4 area is controversial. Area IT."
Beyond V4 in the ventral stream are cortical areas that contain neurons with complicated spatial receptive fields. A major output of V4 is an area in the inferior temporal lobe known as area IT. A wide variety of colors and abstract shapes have been found to be good stimuli for cells in IT.
"As we will see in Chapter 24, this area appears to be important for both visual perception and visual memory. One of the most intriguing findings concerning IT is that a small percentage of the neurons responds strongly to pictures of faces. These cells may also respond to stimuli other than faces, but faces produce a particularly vigorous response, and some faces are more effective stimuli than others."
"This finding in monkeys appears consistent with images made using fMRI in humans, which indicate that there is a small area in the human brain that is more responsive to faces than to other stimuli . The finding of face-selective cells has sparked much interest, in part because of a syndrome called prosopagnosia—difficulty recognizing faces even though vision is otherwise normal. This rare syndrome usually results from a stroke and is associated with damage to extrastriate visual cortex."
"Could it be that our brains contain a group of cells highly specialized for face recognition? The answer is not known. While most scientists agree that faces are particularly good stimuli for a small percentage of cells, this does not mean that these cells are not involved in processing other types of information."
"Visual perception—the task of identifying and assigning meaning to objects in space—obviously requires the concerted action of many cortical neurons. But which neurons in which cortical areas determine what we perceive? How is the simultaneous activity of widely separated cortical neurons integrated, and where does this integration take place?"
"Neuroscience research is only just beginning to tackle these challenging questions. However, sometimes basic observations about receptive fields can give us insight into how we perceive . Comparing the receptive field properties of neurons at different points in the visual system might provide insight about the basis of perception."
"The receptive fields of photoreceptors are simply small patches on the retina, whereas those of retinal ganglion cells have a center-surround structure. The ganglion cells are sensitive to variables such as contrast and the wavelength of light. In striate cortex, we encounter simple and complex receptive fields that have several new properties, including orientation selectivity and binocularity."
"We have seen that in extrastriate cortical areas, cells are selectively responsive to more complex shapes, object motion, and even faces. It appears that the visual system consists of a hierarchy of areas in which receptive fields become increasingly more complex, moving away from V1. Perhaps our perception of specific objects is based on the excitation of a small number of specialized neurons in some ultimate perceptual area that has not yet been identified."
"Is our recognition of our grandmother based on the responses of 5 or 10 cells with receptive field properties so highly refined that the cells respond only to one person? The closest approximation to this is the face-selective neurons in area IT. However, even these fascinating cells do not respond to only one face."
"While it is by no means settled, there are several arguments against the idea that perception is based on extremely selective receptive fields such as those of “grandmother cells. ” First, recordings have been made from most parts of the monkey brain, but there is no evidence that a portion of cortex has cells tuned to each of the millions of objects that we all recognize. Second, such great selectivity appears to be counter to the general principle of broad tuning that exists throughout the nervous system."
"Photoreceptors respond to a range of wavelengths, simple cells respond to many orientations, cells in MT respond to motion in a range of directions, and face cells usually respond to many faces. Moreover, cells that are selective for one property—orientation, color, or whatever—are always sensitive to other properties. For example, we can focus on the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons and the way in which this might relate to the perception of form, neglecting the fact that the same cells might selectively respond to size, direction of motion, and so on."
"Finally, it might be too “risky” for the nervous system to rely on extreme selectivity. A blow to the head might kill all five grandmother cells, and in an instant, we would lose our ability to recognize her. You have probably seen books or posters showing patterns of dots or splotches of color that supposedly contain pictures in 3D, if you contort your eyes just the right way."
"But how is it possible to see three dimensions on a twodimensional piece of paper? The answer is based on the fact that our two eyes always see slightly different images of the world because of the distance between them in the head. The closer objects are to the head, the greater the difference in the two images."
"You can easily demonstrate this to yourself by holding a finger up in front of your eyes and alternately viewing it, at different distances, with the left or right eye closed. Long before anything was known about binocular neurons in visual cortex, stereograms were a popular form of recreation. Two photographs were taken with lenses separated by a distance roughly the same as that of human eyes."
"By looking at the left photograph with the left eye and the right photograph with the right eye , the brain combines the images and interprets the different views as cues for distance . In 1960, Bela Julesz, working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, invented random-dot stereograms . These paired images of random dots are, in principle, the same as the nineteenth-century stereograms."
"The big difference is that no image can be seen with normal binocular viewing. To see the image in 3D, you must direct your left and right eyes to left and right images. The principle in constructing the stereo images is to create a background of randomly spaced dots, and wherever an area should be closer or farther away in the fused image, the dots shown to one eye are horizontally shifted relative to those in the other eye."
"Imagine looking at a white index card covered with random black dots while you hold it in front of a large piece of white paper covered with similar dots. By alternately closing your eyes, the dots on the index card will shift horizontally more than those on the more distant piece of paper. The pair of stereo images captures this difference in viewpoint and erases any other indication that there is a square in front, such as the edge of the index card."
"Random-dot stereograms shocked many scientists, because in 1960, it was commonly thought that depth was perceived only after the images in each eye were separately recognized. In the 1970s, Christopher Tyler at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute created autostereograms. An autostereogram is a single image that, when properly viewed, gives the perception of objects in 3D ."
"The colorful, and sometimes frustrating, autostereograms you see in books are based on an old illusion called the wallpaper effect. If you look at wallpaper that contains a repeating pattern, you can cross  your eyes and view one piece of the pattern with one eye and the next cycle of the pattern with the other eye. The effect makes the wallpaper appear to be closer ."
"In an autostereogram, the wallpaper effect is combined with random-dot stereograms. To see the 3D skull in Figure C, you need to relax your eye muscles so that the left eye looks at the left dot on top and the right eye the right dot. You will know you are getting close when you see three dots at the top of the image."
"Relax and keep looking, and the picture will become visible. One of the fascinating things about stereograms is that you often must look at them for tens of seconds or even minutes, while your eyes become “properly” misaligned and your visual cortex “figures out” the correspondence between the left and right eye views. We do not know what is going on in the brain during this period, but presumably it involves the activation of binocular neurons in the visual cortex."
"If we do not rely on grandmother cells, how does perception work? One alternative hypothesis is formulated around the observation that parallel processing is used throughout the visual system . We encountered parallel processing in Chapter 9 when we discussed ON and OFF and M and P ganglion cells."
"In this chapter, we saw three parallel channels in V1. Extending away from V1 are dorsal and ventral streams of processing, and the different areas in these two streams are biased, or specialized, for various stimulus properties. Perhaps the brain uses a “division of labor” principle for perception."
"Within a given cortical area, many broadly tuned cells may serve to represent features of objects. At a bigger scale, a relatively large group of cortical areas may contribute to perception, some dealing more with color or form, others more with motion. In other words, perception may be more like the sound produced by an orchestra of visual areas than the end product of an assembly line."
"In this chapter, we have outlined the organization of the sensory pathway from eye to thalamus to cortex. We saw that vision actually involves the perception of numerous different properties of objects—color, form, movement— and these properties are processed in parallel by different cells of the visual system. This processing of information evidently requires a strict segregation of inputs at the thalamus, some limited convergence of information in striate cortex, and finally a massive divergence of information as it is passed on to higher cortical areas."
"The distributed nature of the cortical processing of visual information is underscored when you consider that the output of a million ganglion cells can recruit the activity of well over a billion cortical neurons throughout the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes! Somehow, this widespread cortical activity is combined to form a single, seamless perception of the visual world. Heed the lessons learned from the visual system. As we shall see in later chapters, the basic principles of organization in this system—parallel processing, topographic mappings of sensory surfaces, synaptic relays in the dorsal thalamus, cortical modules, and multiple cortical representations— are also features of the sensory systems devoted to hearing and touch."
"In Chapters 3 and 4, we discussed how mechanical energy, such as a thumbtack entering your foot, can be converted into a neural signal. First, specialized ion channels of the sensory nerve endings allow positive charge to enter the axon. If this depolarization reaches threshold, then action potentials are generated."
"Because the axonal membrane is excitable and has voltage-gated sodium channels, action potentials can propagate without decrement up the long sensory nerves. For this information to be processed by the rest of the nervous system, it is necessary that these neural signals be passed on to other neurons—for example, the motor neurons that control muscle contraction, as well as neurons in the brain and spinal cord that lead to a coordinated reflex response. By the end of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that this transfer of information from one neuron to another occurs at specialized sites of contact."
"In 1897, English physiologist Charles Sherrington gave these sites their name: synapses. The process of information transfer at a synapse is called synaptic transmission. The physical nature of synaptic transmission was argued for almost a century."
"One attractive hypothesis, which nicely explained the speed of synaptic transmission, was that it was simply electrical current flowing from one neuron to the next. The existence of such electrical synapses was finally proven in 1959 by Edwin Furshpan and David Potter, Harvard University physiologists who were studying the nervous system of crayfish. We now know that electrical synapses are common in the mammalian brain."
"An alternative hypothesis about the nature of synaptic transmission, also dating back to the 1800s, was that chemical neurotransmitters transfer information from one neuron to another at the synapse. Solid support for the concept of chemical synapses was provided in 1921 by Otto Loewi, then the head of the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz in Austria. Loewi showed that electrical stimulation of axons innervating the frog’s heart caused the release of a chemical and that this chemical could mimic the effects of neuron stimulation on the heartbeat ."
"Later, Bernard Katz and his colleagues at University College London, conclusively demonstrated that fast transmission at the synapse between a motor neuron axon and skeletal muscle was chemically mediated. By 1951, John Eccles of the Australian National University was able to study the physiology of synaptic transmission within the mammalian central nervous system  using a new tool, the glass microelectrode. These experiments indicated that many CNS synapses also use a chemical transmitter."
"Chemical synapses comprise the majority of synapses in the brain. During the last decade, new methods of studying the molecules involved in synaptic transmission have revealed that synapses are far more complex than most neuroscientists anticipated. Synaptic transmission is a large and fascinating topic."
"The actions of psychoactive drugs, the causes of mental disorders, the neural bases of learning and memory—indeed, all the operations of the nervous system— cannot be understood without knowledge of synaptic transmission. Therefore, we’ve devoted several chapters to this topic, mainly focusing on chemical synapses. In this chapter, we begin by exploring the basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission."
"What do different types of synapse look like? How are neurotransmitters synthesized and stored, and how are they released in response to an action potential in the axon terminal? How do neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic membrane?"
"How do single neurons integrate the inputs provided by the thousands of synapses that impinge upon them? One of the more colorful stories in the history of neuroscience was contributed by Otto Loewi, who, working in Austria in the 1920s, showed definitively that synaptic transmission between nerve and heart is chemically mediated. The heart is supplied with two types of innervation; one type speeds the beating of the heart, and the other slows it."
"The latter type of innervation is supplied by the vagus nerve. Loewi isolated a frog heart with the vagal innervation left intact, stimulated the nerve electrically, and observed the expected effect, the slowing of the heartbeat. The critical demonstration that this effect was chemically mediated came when he took the solution that bathed this heart, applied it to a second isolated frog heart, and found that the beating of this one also slowed."
"The idea for this experiment had actually come to Loewi in a dream. Below is his own account: In the night of Easter Sunday, 1921, I awoke, turned on the light, and jotted down a few notes on a tiny slip of paper. Then, I fell asleep again."
"It occurred to me at six o’clock in the morning that during the night I had written down something most important, but I was unable to decipher the scrawl. That Sunday was the most desperate day in my whole scientific life. During the next night, however, I awoke again, at three o’clock, and I remembered what it was."
"This time I did not take any risk; I got up immediately,went to the laboratory, made the experiment on the frog’s heart, described above, and at five o’clock the chemical transmission of the nervous impulse was conclusively proved. . ."
". Careful consideration in daytime would undoubtedly have rejected the kind of experiment I performed, because it would have seemed most unlikely that if a nervous impulse released a transmitting agent, it would do so not just in sufficient quantity to influence the effector organ, in my case the heart, but indeed in such an excess that it could partly escape into the fluid which filled the heart, and could therefore be detected. Yet the whole nocturnal concept of the experiment was based on this eventuality, and the result proved to be positive, contrary to expectation."
"The active compound, which Loewi called vagusstoff, turned out to be acetylcholine. As we shall see in this chapter, acetylcholine is also a transmitter at the synapse between nerve and skeletal muscle. Here, unlike at the heart, acetylcholine causes excitation and contraction of the muscle."
"We introduced the synapse in Chapter 2. A synapse is the specialized junction where one part of a neuron contacts and communicates with another neuron or cell type . Information tends to flow in one direction, from a neuron to its target cell."
"The first neuron is said to be presynaptic and the target cell is said to be postsynaptic. Let’s take a closer look at the different types of synapse. Electrical synapses are relatively simple in structure and function, and they allow the direct transfer of ionic current from one cell to the next."
"Electrical synapses occur at specialized sites called gap junctions. At a gap junction, the membranes of two cells are separated by only about 3 nm, and this narrow gap is spanned by clusters of special proteins called connexins. Six connexins combine to form a channel called a connexon, and two connexons  combine to form a gap junction channel ."
"The channel allows ions to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to the cytoplasm of the other. The pore of most gap junction channels is relatively large. Its diameter is about 1–2 nm, big enough for all the major cellular ions, and many small organic molecules, to pass through."
"Most gap junctions allow ionic current to pass equally well in both directions; therefore, unlike the vast majority of chemical synapses, electrical synapses are bidirectional. Because electrical current  can pass through these channels, cells connected by gap junctions are said to be electrically coupled. Transmission at electrical synapses is very fast and, if the synapse is large, fail-safe."
"Thus, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron can produce, almost instantaneously, an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. In invertebrate species, such as the crayfish, electrical synapses are sometimes found between sensory and motor neurons in neural pathways mediating escape reflexes. This mechanism enables an animal to beat a hasty retreat when faced with a dangerous situation."
"Electrical synapses also occur in the vertebrate brain . Studies over the past few years have revealed that electrical synapses are common in every part of the mammalian CNS . When two neurons are electrically coupled, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron causes a small amount of ionic current to flow across the gap junction channels into the other neuron."
"This current causes a postsynaptic potential  in the second neuron . Because most electrical synapses are bidirectional, note that when the second neuron generates an action potential, it will in turn induce a PSP in the first neuron. The PSP generated by a single electrical synapse in the mammalian brain is usually small—about 1 mV or less at its peak—and may not, by itself, be large enough to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell."
"One neuron usually makes electrical synapses with many other neurons, however, so several PSPs occurring simultaneously may strongly excite a neuron. This is an example of synaptic integration, which is discussed later in the chapter. The precise roles of electrical synapses vary from one brain region to another."
"They are often found where normal function requires that the activity of neighboring neurons be highly synchronized. Gap junctions between neurons are particularly common during early embryonic stages. Evidence suggests that during brain development, gap junctions allow neighboring cells to share both electrical and chemical signals that may help coordinate their growth and maturation."
"Gap junctions also interconnect many non-neural cells, including glia, epithelial cells, smooth and cardiac muscle cells, liver cells, and some glandular cells. Most synaptic transmission in the mature human nervous system is chemical, so we will now focus exclusively on chemical synapses. Before we discuss the different types of chemical synapse, let’s take a look at some of their universal characteristics ."
"The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes at chemical synapses are separated by a synaptic cleft that is 20–50 nm wide, 10 times the width of the separation at gap junctions. The cleft is filled with a matrix of fibrous extracellular protein. One function of this matrix is to make the pre- and postsynaptic membranes adhere to each other."
"The presynaptic side of the synapse, also called the presynaptic element, is usually an axon terminal. The terminal typically contains dozens of small membrane-enclosed spheres, each about 50 nm in diameter, called synaptic vesicles . These vesicles store neurotransmitter, the chemical used to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron."
"Many axon terminals also contain larger vesicles, each about 100 nm in diameter, called secretory granules. Secretory granules contain soluble protein that appears dark in the electron microscope, so they are sometimes called large, dense-core vesicles . Dense accumulations of protein adjacent to and within the membranes on either side of the synaptic cleft are collectively called membrane differentiations."
"On the presynaptic side, proteins jutting into the cytoplasm of the terminal along the intracellular face of the membrane sometimes look like a field of tiny pyramids. The pyramids, and the membrane associated with them, are the actual sites of neurotransmitter release, called active zones. Synaptic vesicles are clustered in the cytoplasm adjacent to the active zones ."
"The protein thickly accumulated in and just under the postsynaptic membrane is called the postsynaptic density. The postsynaptic density contains the neurotransmitter receptors, which convert the intercellular chemical signal  into an intracellular signal  in the postsynaptic cell. As we shall see, the nature of this postsynaptic response can be quite varied, depending on the type of protein receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitter."
"CNS Synapses. In the CNS, different types of synapse may be distinguished by which part of the neuron is postsynaptic to the axon terminal. If the postsynaptic membrane is on a dendrite, the synapse is said to be axodendritic."
"If the postsynaptic membrane is on the cell body, the synapse is said to be axosomatic. In some cases, the postsynaptic membrane is on another axon, and these synapses are called axoaxonic . In certain specialized neurons, dendrites actually form synapses with one another; these are called dendrodendritic synapses."
"The sizes and shapes of CNS synapses also vary widely . CNS synapses may be further classified into two general categories based on the appearance of their presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane differentiations, under the powerful magnification of the electron microscope. Synapses in which the membrane differentiation on the postsynaptic side is thicker than that on the presynaptic side are called asymmetrical synapses, or Gray’s type I synapses; those in which the membrane differentiations are of similar thickness are called symmetrical synapses, or Gray’s type II synapses ."
"As we shall see later in the chapter, these structural differences predict functional differences. Gray’s type I synapses are usually excitatory, while Gray’s type II synapses are usually inhibitory. The Neuromuscular Junction."
"Synaptic junctions also exist outside the central nervous system. For example, axons of the autonomic nervous system innervate glands, smooth muscle, and the heart. Chemical synapses also occur between the axons of motor neurons of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle."
"Such a synapse is called a neuromuscular junction, and it has many of the structural features of chemical synapses in the CNS . The question of soup versus sparks, not so recent slang for chemical transmission versus electrical transmission, goes back to the 1800s. The pharmacologists, who applied drugs to their experimental preparations, favored soup."
"The electrophysiologists, who used electrical stimuli and studied action potentials favored sparks. They argued that chemicals were too slow, and besides, if electrical current was good enough for axons, it should work for synapses as well. Eventually, intracellular electrodes demonstrated that synaptic transmission was indeed chemical at the neuromuscular junction and at synapses on spinal motoneurons, and people were convinced."
"The vote was in— all synaptic transmission was chemical; case closed. In that context I started postdoctoral work with Harry Grundfrest at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City. Every summer he transported his laboratory to the Marine Biological Laboratory , in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; I accompanied him and have been going ever since."
"He proposed that I and Stanley Crain work on the supramedullary neurons of the pufferfish. These brain stem neurons are large, even visible to the naked eye. We soon found that they send their axons to the skin and are excited by cutaneous inputs."
"Each cell is large enough to permit penetration by two microelectrodes, for current application and voltage recording. Now and then our electrodes accidentally penetrated adjacent cells, which led to the discovery that all cells give the same number of impulses in response to stimuli, and that an impulse evoked in one cell could spread to other cells; the cells are mutually excitatory. At first, and for several wrong reasons, it seemed that the mutual excitation was chemically mediated; I thought that the spike in the initial part of the axon was an excitatory postsynaptic potential."
"Jack Eccles, subsequently Sir John, was passing through the lab. He looked at a spike on the oscilloscope screen, in the sort of live demonstration that rarely works, and said, no, that potential is the spike from the initial axon segment; push your electrode deeper and record from the axons. Damned if he wasn’t right, but there was more."
"Recording in an axon, I found the soma of a different neuron that was electrically coupled to it for hyperpolarization as well as depolarization. This was impossible to ignore, even for the unprepared mind: there were electrical synapses between the two cells. Several important biophysical properties of electrical transmission were exemplified by these giant neurons."
"Some years later Yasuko Nakajima, using electron microscopy  and working with George Pappas, found gap junctions between axons of the supramedullary neurons. A couple of years later I was working on fish electric organs in Harry’s lab, and he pointed me to the question of neural control. Emilio Aljure and I looked at the spinal cord of a mormyrid electric fish."
"The neurons fire highly synchronously, and the synchrony is mediated by electrical coupling between the cells. Mutually excitatory chemical synapses would not be adequate to synchronize their firing because of their characteristic delay. Nakajima and Pappas showed that the dendrites were connected by gap junctions ."
"We suggested in a brief Science paper that EM identification of electrical synapses might be useful in examining dendritic regions. We were pleased when 10 years later John Sloper and Thomas Powell, using EM, found dendrodendritic gap junctions in primate neocortex. The early work on electrical synapses was done almost entirely in fishes and invertebrates; many mammalian physiologists regarded electrical transmission as primitive compared to chemical transmission and unsuited for the subtle neural processing of the mammalian brain."
"During the 1980s, a few examples of electrical coupling of neurons became known in mammals, such as inferior olive cells and retinal horizontal cells. Now technical advances have led to a burgeoning of knowledge about electrical synapses in mammals. Electrical synapses exist where they are useful."
"Although their numbers are small compared to chemical synapses, any description of how the nervous system works requires their inclusion. In general in mammals, the speed of electrical transmission is not the only explanation for its being there. A more likely selective advantage is its ability to synchronize neural activity by reciprocal action and transmission of sub-threshold voltages."
"Ramon y Cajal was right when he concluded that the nervous system is made of individual, discontinuous neurons. But he also wrote that the neuron doctrine could withstand some exceptions. The direct connection between cell interiors provided by gap junctions could be viewed as an exception."
"Neuromuscular synaptic transmission is fast and reliable. An action potential in the motor axon always causes an action potential in the muscle cell it innervates. This reliability is accounted for, in part, by structural specializations of the neuromuscular junction."
"Its most important specialization is its size—it is one of the largest synapses in the body. The presynaptic terminal also contains a large number of active zones. In addition, the post-synaptic membrane, also called the motor end-plate, contains a series of shallow folds."
"The presynaptic active zones are precisely aligned with these junctional folds, and the postsynaptic membrane of the folds is packed with neurotransmitter receptors. This structure ensures that many neurotransmitter molecules are focally released onto a large surface of chemically sensitive membrane. Because neuromuscular junctions are more accessible to researchers than CNS synapses, much of what we know about the mechanisms of synaptic transmission was first established here."
"Neuromuscular junctions are also of considerable clinical significance; diseases, drugs, and poisons that interfere with this chemical synapse have direct effects on vital bodily functions. Consider the basic requirements of chemical synaptic transmission. There must be a mechanism for synthesizing neurotransmitter and packing it into the synaptic vesicles, a mechanism for causing vesicles to spill their contents into the synaptic cleft in response to a presynaptic action potential, a mechanism for producing an electrical or biochemical response to neurotransmitter in the postsynaptic neuron, and a mechanism for removing neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft."
"And, to be useful for sensation, perception, and the control of movement, all these things must occur very rapidly. No wonder physiologists initially were skeptical about the existence of chemical synapses in the brain! Fortunately, thanks to several decades of research on the topic, we now understand how many of these aspects of synaptic transmission are so efficiently carried out. Here we present a general survey of the basic principles."
"In Chapter 6, we will take a more detailed look at the individual neurotransmitters and their modes of postsynaptic action. Since the discovery of chemical synaptic transmission, researchers have been identifying neurotransmitters in the brain. Our current understanding is that most neurotransmitters fall into one of three chemical categories:  amino acids,  amines, and  peptides ."
"Some representatives of these categories are shown in Figure 5. 9. The amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are all small organic molecules containing at least one nitrogen atom, and they are stored in and released from synaptic vesicles."
"Peptide neurotransmitters are large molecules stored in and released from secretory granules. As mentioned above, secretory granules and synaptic vesicles are frequently observed in the same axon terminals. Consistent with this observation, peptides often exist in the same axon terminals that contain amine or amino acid neurotransmitters."
"And, as we’ll discuss in a moment, these different neurotransmitters are released under different conditions. Different neurons in the brain release different neurotransmitters. Fast synaptic transmission at most CNS synapses is mediated by the amino acids glutamate , gamma-aminobutyric acid , and glycine ."
The amine acetylcholine  mediates fast synaptic transmission at all neuromuscular junctions. Slower forms of synaptic transmission in the CNS and in the periphery are mediated by transmitters from all three chemical categories. Chemical synaptic transmission requires that neurotransmitters be synthesized and ready for release.
"Different neurotransmitters are synthesized in different ways. For example, glutamate and glycine are among the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks of protein ; consequently, they are abundant in all cells of the body, including neurons. In contrast, GABA and the amines are made only by the neurons that release them."
"These neurons contain specific enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmitters from various metabolic precursors. The synthesizing enzymes for both amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are transported to the axon terminal, where they locally and rapidly direct transmitter synthesis. Once synthesized in the cytosol of the axon terminal, the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters must be taken up by the synaptic vesicles."
"Concentrating these neurotransmitters inside the vesicle is the job of transporters, special proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane. Quite different mechanisms are used to synthesize and store peptides in secretory granules. As we learned in Chapters 2 and 3, peptides are formed when amino acids are strung together by the ribosomes of the cell body."
"In the case of peptide neurotransmitters, this occurs in the rough ER. Generally, a long peptide synthesized in the rough ER is split in the Golgi apparatus, and one of the smaller peptide fragments is the active neurotransmitter. Secretory granules containing the peptide neurotransmitter bud off from the Golgi apparatus and are carried to the axon terminal by axoplasmic transport."
Figure 5. 10 compares the synthesis and storage of amine and amino acid neurotransmitters with that of peptide neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter release is triggered by the arrival of an action potential in the axon terminal.
"The depolarization of the terminal membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the active zones to open. These membrane channels are very similar to the sodium channels we discussed in Chapter 4, except they are permeable to Ca2 ions instead of Na ions. There is a large inward driving force on Ca2."
"Remember that the internal calcium ion concentration—[Ca2]i—at rest is very low, only 0. 0002 mM; therefore, Ca2 will flood the cytoplasm of the axon terminal as long as the calcium channels are open. The resulting elevation in [Ca2]i is the signal that causes neurotransmitter to be released from synaptic vesicles."
"The vesicles release their contents by a process called exocytosis. The membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses to the presynaptic membrane at the active zone, allowing the contents of the vesicle to spill out into the synaptic cleft . Studies of a giant synapse in the squid nervous system showed that exocytosis can occur very rapidly—within 0."
"2 msec of the Ca2 influx into the terminal. Synapses in mammals, which generally operate at higher temperatures, are even faster. Exocytosis is quick because Ca2 enters at the active zone, precisely where synaptic vesicles are ready and waiting to release their contents."
"In this local “microdomain” around the active zone, calcium can achieve very high concentrations . The precise mechanism by which [Ca2]i stimulates exocytosis is poorly understood, but it is currently under intensive investigation. The speed of neurotransmitter release suggests that the vesicles involved are those already “docked” at the active zones."
"Docking is believed to involve interactions between proteins in the synaptic vesicle membrane and the active zone . In the presence of high [Ca2]i, these proteins alter their conformation so that the lipid bilayers of the vesicle and presynaptic membranes fuse, forming a pore that allows the neurotransmitter to escape into the cleft. The mouth of this exocytotic fusion pore continues to expand until the membrane of the vesicle is fully incorporated into the presynaptic membrane ."
"The vesicle membrane is later recovered by the process of endocytosis, and the recycled vesicle is refilled with neurotransmitter . During periods of prolonged stimulation, vesicles are mobilized from a “reserve pool” that is bound to the cytoskeleton of the axon terminal. The release of these vesicles from the cytoskeleton, and their docking to the active zone, is also triggered by elevations of [Ca2]i."
"Secretory granules also release peptide neurotransmitters by exocytosis, in a calcium-dependent fashion, but typically not at the active zones. Because the sites of granule exocytosis occur at a distance from the sites of Ca2 entry, peptide neurotransmitters are usually not released in response to every action potential invading the terminal. Instead, the release of peptides generally requires high-frequency trains of action potentials, so that the [Ca2]i throughout the terminal can build to the level required to trigger release away from the active zones."
"Unlike the fast release of amino acid and amine neurotransmitters, the release of peptides is a leisurely process, taking 50 msec or more. Neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft affect the postsynaptic neuron by binding to specific receptor proteins that are embedded in the postsynaptic density. The binding of neurotransmitter to the receptor is like inserting a key in a lock; this causes conformational changes in the protein, and the protein can then function differently."
"Although there are well over 100 different neurotransmitter receptors, they can be classified into two types: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors. Transmitter-Gated Ion Channels. Receptors known as transmittergated ion channels are membrane-spanning proteins consisting of four or five subunits that come together to form a pore between them ."
"In the absence of neurotransmitter, the pore is usually closed. When neurotransmitter binds to specific sites on the extracellular region of the channel, it induces a conformational change—just a slight twist of the subunits— which within microseconds causes the pore to open. The functional consequence of this depends on which ions can pass through the pore."
"Transmitter-gated channels generally do not show the same degree of ion selectivity as do voltage-gated channels. For example, the ACh-gated ion channels at the neuromuscular junction are permeable to both Na and K ions. Nonetheless, as a rule, if the open channels are permeable to Na, the net effect will be to depolarize the postsynaptic cell from the resting membrane potential ."
"Because it tends to bring the membrane potential toward threshold for generating action potentials, this effect is said to be excitatory. A transient postsynaptic membrane depolarization caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential  . Synaptic activation of AChgated and glutamate-gated ion channels causes EPSPs."
"If the transmitter-gated channels are permeable to Cl, the net effect will be to hyperpolarize the postsynaptic cell from the resting membrane potential . Because it tends to bring the membrane potential away from threshold for generating action potentials, this effect is said to be inhibitory. A transient hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane potential caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential  ."
Synaptic activation of glycine-gated or GABA-gated ion channels cause an IPSP. We’ll discuss EPSPs and IPSPs in more detail when we explore the principles of synaptic integration shortly. Yeasts are single-celled organisms valued for their ability to make dough rise and grape juice ferment.
"Remarkably, the humble yeasts have some close similarities to the chemical synapses in our brain. Recent research has shown that the proteins controlling secretion in both yeast cells and synapses are only minor variations of each other. Apparently, these molecules are so generally useful that they have been conserved across more than a billion years of evolution, and they are found in all eukaryotic cells."
"The trick to fast synaptic function is to deliver neurotransmitter-filled vesicles to just the right place—the presynaptic membrane, and then cause them to fuse at just the right time—when an action potential delivers a pulse of high Ca2concentration to the cytosol. This process of exocytosis is a special case of a more general cellular problem, membrane trafficking. Cells have many types of membranes, including those enclosing the whole cell, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and various types of vesicles."
"To avoid intracellular chaos, each of these membranes needs to be moved and delivered to specific locations within the cell. After delivery, one type of membrane often has to fuse with another type. A common molecular machinery has evolved for the delivery and fusion of all these membranes, and small variations in these molecules determine how and when membrane trafficking takes place."
"The specific binding and fusion of membranes seem to depend on the SNARE family of proteins, which were first found in yeast cells. SNARE is an acronym too convoluted to define here, but the name perfectly defines the function of these proteins—SNAREs allow one membrane to snare another. Each SNARE peptide has a lipid-loving end that embeds itself within the membrane and a longer tail that projects into the cytosol."
"Vesicles have “v-SNAREs,” and the outer membrane has “t-SNAREs” . The cytosolic ends of these two complementary types of SNAREs can bind tightly to one another, allowing a vesicle to “dock” very close to a presynaptic membrane and nowhere else . Although SNARE-to-SNARE complexes form the main connection between vesicle membrane and target membrane, a large and bewildering array of other proteins stick to the “SNAREpin."
"” We still don’t understand the functions of most of them, but synaptotagmin, a vesicle protein, may be the critical Ca2sensor that rapidly triggers vesicle fusion and thus transmitter release. On the presynaptic membrane side, calcium channels may form part of the docking complex. By placing the calcium channels very close to the docked vesicles, inflowing Ca2can trigger transmitter release with astonishing speed—within about 60 μsec in a mammalian synapse at body temperature."
"We have a long way to go before we understand all the molecules involved in synaptic transmission. In the meantime, we can count on yeasts to provide delightful brain food  for thought. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors."
"Fast chemical synaptic transmission is mediated by amino acid and amine neurotransmitters acting on transmitter- gated ion channels. However, all three types of neurotransmitter, acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, can also have slower, longer-lasting, and much more diverse postsynaptic actions. This type of transmitter action involves three steps: 1) Neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptor proteins embedded in the postsynaptic membrane."
"2) The receptor proteins activate small proteins, called G-proteins, that are free to move along the intracellular face of the postsynaptic membrane. 3) The activated G-proteins activate “effector” proteins. Effector proteins can be G-protein-gated ion channels in the membrane , or they can be enzymes that synthesize molecules called second messengers that diffuse away in the cytosol ."
"Second messengers can activate additional enzymes in the cytosol that can regulate ion channel function and alter cellular metabolism. Because Gprotein- coupled receptors can trigger widespread metabolic effects, they are often referred to as metabotropic receptors. We’ll discuss the different neurotransmitters, their receptors, and their effectors in more detail in Chapter 6."
"However, you should be aware that the same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions, depending on what receptors it binds to. An example is the effect of ACh on the heart and on skeletal muscles. ACh slows the rhythmic contractions of the heart by causing a slow hyperpolarization of the cardiac muscle cells."
"In contrast, in skeletal muscle, ACh induces contraction by causing a rapid depolarization of the muscle fibers. These different actions are explained by different receptors. In the heart, a metabotropic ACh receptor is coupled by a G-protein to a potassium channel."
"The opening of the potassium channel hyperpolarizes the cardiac muscle fibers. In skeletal muscle, the receptor is a transmitter-gated ion channel, specifically an ACh-gated ion channel, permeable to Na+. The opening of this channel depolarizes the muscle fibers."
"Autoreceptors. Besides being a part of the postsynaptic density, neurotransmitter receptors are also commonly found in the membrane of the presynaptic axon terminal. Presynaptic receptors that are sensitive to the neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic terminal are called autoreceptors."
"Typically, autoreceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that stimulate second messenger formation. The consequences of activating these receptors vary, but a common effect is inhibition of neurotransmitter release and, in some cases, neurotransmitter synthesis. This allows a presynaptic terminal to regulate itself."
"Autoreceptors appear to function as a sort of safety valve to reduce release when the concentration of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft gets too high. Once the released neurotransmitter has interacted with postsynaptic receptors, it must be cleared from the synaptic cleft to allow another round of synaptic transmission. One way this happens is by simple diffusion of the transmitter molecules away from the synapse."
"For most of the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters, however, diffusion is aided by their reuptake into the presynaptic axon terminal. Reuptake occurs by the action of specific neurotransmitter transporter proteins located in the presynaptic membrane. Once inside the cytosol of the terminal, the transmitters may be enzymatically destroyed, or they may be reloaded into synaptic vesicles."
"Neurotransmitter transporters also exist in the membranes of glia surrounding the synapse, which assist in the removal of neurotransmitter from the cleft. Another way neurotransmitter action can be terminated is by enzymatic destruction in the synaptic cleft itself. This is how ACh is removed at the neuromuscular junction, for example."
"The enzyme acetylcholinesterase  is deposited in the cleft by the muscle cells. AChE cleaves the ACh molecule, rendering it inactive at the ACh receptors. The importance of transmitter removal from the cleft should not be underestimated."
"At the neuromuscular junction, for example, uninterrupted exposure to high concentrations of ACh after several seconds leads to a process called desensitization, in which, despite the continued presence of ACh, the transmitter-gated channels close. This desensitized state can persist for many seconds even after the neurotransmitter is removed. The rapid destruction of ACh by AChE normally prevents desensitization from occurring."
"However, if the AChE is inhibited, as it is by various nerve gases used as chemical weapons, the ACh receptors will become desensitized and neuromuscular transmission will fail. In Chapter 4, we saw that when the membrane voltagegated sodium channels open during an action potential, Na enters the cell, causing the membrane potential to rapidly depolarize until it approaches the sodium equilibrium potential, ENa, about 40 mV. Unlike the voltage-gated channels, however, many transmitter-gated ion channels are not permeable to a single type of ion."
"For example, the ACh-gated ion channel at the neuromuscular junction is permeable to both Na and to K. Let’s explore the functional consequence of activating these channels. In Chapter 3, we learned that the membrane potential, Vm, can be calculated using the Goldman equation, which takes into account the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions ."
"If the membrane were equally permeable to Na and K, as it would be if the ACh-gated channels were open, then Vm would have a value between ENa and EK, around 0 mV. Therefore, ionic current would flow through the channels in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward 0 mV. If the membrane potential were 0 mV before ACh was applied, as is usually the case, the direction of net current flow through the ACh-gated ion channels would be inward, causing a depolarization."
"However, if the membrane potential were 0 mV before ACh was applied, the direction of net current flow through the ACh-gated ion channels would be outward, causing the membrane potential to become less positive. Ionic current flow at different membrane voltages can be graphed, as shown in Figure A. Such a graph is called an I-V plot ."
"The critical value of membrane potential at which the direction of current flow reverses is called the reversal potential. In this case, the reversal potential would be 0 mV. The experimental determination of a reversal potential, therefore, helps tell us which types of ions the membrane is permeable to."
"If, by changing the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions, a neurotransmitter causes Vm to move toward a value that is more positive than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed excitatory. As a rule, neurotransmitters that open a channel permeable to Na are excitatory. If a neurotransmitter causes Vm to take on a value that is more negative than the action potential threshold, the neurotransmitter action would be termed inhibitory."
"Neurotransmitters that open a channel permeable to Cl tend to be inhibitory, as are neurotransmitters that open a channel permeable only to K. Each of the steps of synaptic transmission we have discussed so far—neurotransmitter synthesis, loading into synaptic vesicles, exocytosis, binding and activation of receptors, reuptake, and degradation—is chemical, and therefore can be affected by specific drugs and toxins . The study of the effects of drugs on nervous system tissue is called neuropharmacology."
"What do the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, black widow spiders, cobras, and humans have in common? They all produce toxins that attack the chemical synaptic transmission that occurs at the neuromuscular junction. Botulism is caused by several kinds of botulinum neurotoxins that are produced by the growth of C."
"botulinum in improperly canned foods. Botulinum toxins are very potent blockers of neuromuscular transmission; it has been estimated that as few as 10 molecules of the toxins are enough to inhibit a cholinergic synapse. Botulinum toxins are extraordinarily specific enzymes that destroy certain of the SNARE proteins in the presynaptic terminals, which are critical for transmitter release ."
"Ironically, this specific action of the toxins made them important tools in the early research on SNAREs. Although its mechanism of action is different, black widow spider venom also exerts deadly effects by affecting transmitter release . The venom first increases, and then eliminates, ACh release at the neuromuscular junction."
"Electron microscopic examination of synapses poisoned with black widow spider venom reveals that the axon terminals are swollen and the synaptic vesicles are missing. The action of the venom, a protein molecule, is not entirely understood. Venom binds with proteins on the outside of the presynaptic membrane, perhaps forming a membrane pore that depolarizes the terminal and allows Ca2 to enter and trigger rapid and total depletion of transmitter."
"In some cases, the venom can induce transmitter release even without the need for Ca2. The bite of the Taiwanese cobra also results in the blockade of neuromuscular transmission in its victim, but by yet another mechanism. One of the active compounds in the snake’s venom, called -bungarotoxin, is a peptide molecule that binds so tightly to the postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors that it takes days to be removed."
"Often, there is not time for its removal, however, because cobra toxin prevents the activation of nicotinic receptors by ACh, thereby paralyzing the respiratory muscles of its victims. We humans have synthesized a large number of chemicals that poison synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Originally motivated by the search for chemical warfare agents, this effort led to the development of a new class of compounds called organophosphates."
"These are irreversible inhibitors of AChE, and by preventing the degradation of ACh, they probably kill their victims by causing a desensitization of ACh receptors. The organophosphates used today as insecticides, like parathion, are toxic to humans only in high doses. Above, we mentioned that nerve gases can interfere with synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the enzyme AChE."
"This interference represents one class of drug action, which is to inhibit the normal function of specific proteins involved in synaptic transmission; such drugs are called inhibitors. Inhibitors of neurotransmitter receptors, called receptor antagonists, bind to the receptors and block  the normal action of the transmitter. An example of a receptor antagonist is curare, an arrow-tip poison traditionally used by South American Indians to paralyze their prey."
"Curare binds tightly to the ACh receptors on skeletal muscle cells and blocks the actions of ACh, thereby preventing muscle contraction. Other drugs bind to receptors, but instead of inhibiting them, they mimic the actions of the naturally occurring neurotransmitter. These drugs are called receptor agonists."
"An example of a receptor agonist is nicotine, derived from the tobacco plant. Nicotine binds to, and activates, the ACh receptors in skeletal muscle. In fact, the ACh-gated ion channels in muscle are also called nicotinic ACh receptors, to distinguish them from other types of ACh receptors, such as those in the heart, that are not activated by nicotine."
"There are also nicotinic ACh receptors in the CNS, and these are involved in the addictive effects of tobaccco use. The immense chemical complexity of synaptic transmission makes it especially susceptible to the medical corollary of Murphy’s law, which states that if a physiological process can go wrong, it will go wrong. When chemical synaptic transmission goes wrong, the nervous system malfunctions."
"Defective neurotransmission is believed to be the root cause of a large number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The good news is that, thanks to our growing knowledge of the neuropharmacology of synaptic transmission, clinicians have new and increasingly effective therapeutic drugs for treating these disorders. We’ll discuss the synaptic basis of some psychiatric disorders, and their neuropharmacological treatment, in Chapter 22."
Most CNS neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs that activate different combinations of transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors. The postsynaptic neuron integrates all these complex ionic and chemical signals and gives rise to a simple form of output: action potentials. The transformation of many synaptic inputs to a single neuronal output constitutes a neural computation.
"The brain performs billions of neural computations every second we are alive. As a first step toward understanding how neural computations are performed, let’s explore some basic principles of synaptic integration. Synaptic integration is the process by which multiple synaptic potentials combine within one postsynaptic neuron."
"The most elementary postsynaptic response is the opening of a single transmitter-gated channel . Inward current through these channels depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, causing the EPSP. The postsynaptic membrane of one synapse may have from a few tens to several thousands of transmitter-gated channels; how many of these are activated during synaptic transmission depends mainly on how much neurotransmitter is released."
Quantal Analysis of EPSPs. The elementary unit of neurotransmitter release is the contents of a single synaptic vesicle. Vesicles each contain about the same number of transmitter molecules ; the total amount of transmitter released is some multiple of this number.
"Consequently, the amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP is some multiple of the response to the contents of a single vesicle. Stated another way, postsynaptic EPSPs at a given synapse are quantized; they are multiples of an indivisible unit, the quantum, that reflects the number of transmitter molecules in a single synaptic vesicle and the number of postsynaptic receptors available at the synapse. At many synapses, exocytosis of vesicles occurs at some very low rate in the absence of presynaptic stimulation."
"The size of the postsynaptic response to this spontaneously released neurotransmitter can be measured electrophysiologically. This tiny response is a miniature postsynaptic potential, often called simply a “mini. ” Each mini is generated by the transmitter contents of one vesicle."
"The amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP evoked by a presynaptic action potential, then, is simply an integer multiple  of the mini amplitude. Quantal analysis, a method of comparing the amplitudes of miniature and evoked postsynaptic potentials, can be used to determine how many vesicles release neurotransmitter during normal synaptic transmission. Quantal analysis of transmission at the neuromuscular junction reveals that a single action potential in the presynaptic terminal triggers the exocytosis of about 200 synaptic vesicles, causing an EPSP of 40 mV or more."
"At many CNS synapses, in striking contrast, the contents of only a single vesicle are released in response to a presynaptic action potential, causing an EPSP of only a few tenths of a millivolt. EPSP Summation. The difference between excitatory transmission at neuromuscular junctions and CNS synapses is not surprising."
"The neuromuscular junction has evolved to be fail-safe; it needs to work every time, and the best way to ensure this is to generate an EPSP of a huge size. On the other hand, if every CNS synapse were, by itself, capable of triggering an action potential in its postsynaptic cell , then a neuron would be little more than a simple relay station. Instead, most neurons perform more sophisticated computations, requiring that many EPSPs add together to produce a significant postsynaptic depolarization."
This is what is meant by integration of EPSPs. EPSP summation represents the simplest form of synaptic integration in the CNS. There are two types of summation: spatial and temporal.
"Spatial summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite. Temporal summation is the adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succession, within about 1–15 msec of one another . Even with the summation of several EPSPs out on a dendrite, the depolarization still may not be enough to cause a neuron to fire an action potential."
"The current entering at the sites of synaptic contact must spread down the dendrite, through the soma, and cause the membrane of the spike-initiation zone to be depolarized beyond threshold, before an action potential can be generated. The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse in triggering an action potential, therefore, depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone and on the properties of the dendritic membrane. Dendritic Cable Properties."
"To simplify the analysis of how dendritic properties contribute to synaptic integration, let’s assume that dendrites function as cylindrical cables that are electrically passive; that is, lacking voltage-gated ion channels . Using an analogy introduced in Chapter 4, imagine that the influx of positive charge at a synapse is like turning on the water that will flow down a leaky garden hose . There are two paths the water can take: One is down the inside of the hose; the other is through the leaks."
"By the same token, there are two paths that synaptic current can take: One is down the inside of the dendrite; the other is across the dendritic membrane. At some distance from the site of current influx, the EPSP amplitude may approach zero because of the dissipation of the current across the membrane. The decrease in depolarization as a function of distance along a dendritic cable is plotted in Figure 5."
"19. In order to simplify the mathematics, in this example we assume the dendrite is infinitely long, unbranched, and uniform in diameter. Notice that the amount of depolarization falls off exponentially with increasing distance."
"Depolarization of the membrane at a given distance  can be described by the equation Vx  Vo/ex/	, where Vo is depolarization at the origin , e  is the base of natural logarithms, x is the distance from the synapse, and l is a constant that depends on the properties of the dendrite. Notice that when x  	, then Vx  Vo/e. Put another way, V	  0."
"37 . This distance 	, where the depolarization is 37% of that at the origin, is called the dendritic length constant. The length constant is an index of how far depolarization can spread down a dendrite or axon."
"The longer the length constant, the more likely it is that EPSPs generated at distant synapses will depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock. The value of 	 in our idealized, electrically passive dendrite depends on two factors:  the resistance to current flowing longitudinally down the dendrite, called the internal resistance ; and  the resistance to current flowing across the membrane, called the membrane resistance . Most current will take the path of least resistance; therefore, the value of 	 will increase as membrane resistance increases because more depolarizing current will flow down the inside of the dendrite."
"The value of 	 will decrease as internal resistance increases because more current will flow across the membrane. Just as water will flow farther down a wide hose with few leaks, synaptic current will flow farther down a wide dendrite  with few open membrane channels . The internal resistance depends only on the diameter of the dendrite and the electrical properties of the cytoplasm; consequently, it is relatively constant in a mature neuron."
"The membrane resistance, in contrast, depends on the number of open ion channels, which changes from moment to moment depending on what other synapses are active. The dendritic length constant, therefore, is not constant at all! As we will see in a moment, fluctuations in the value of l are an important factor in synaptic integration. Excitable Dendrites."
"Our analysis of dendritic cable properties made another important assumption: The dendrite’s membrane is electrically passive, which means it lacks voltage-gated channels. Some dendrites in the brain have nearly passive and inexcitable membranes, and thus follow the simple cable equations. The dendrites of spinal motor neurons, for example, are very close to passive."
"However, many other neuronal dendrites are decidedly not passive. A variety of neurons have dendrites with significant numbers of voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Dendrites rarely have enough ion channels to generate fully propagating action potentials, as in axons."
"But the voltage-gated channels in dendrites can act as important amplifiers of small postsynaptic potentials generated far out on dendrites. EPSPs that would diminish to near nothingness in a long, passive dendrite may nevertheless be large enough to trigger the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which in turn would add current to boost the synaptic signal along toward the soma. Paradoxically, in some cells dendritic sodium channels may also serve to carry electrical signals in the other direction—from the soma outward along dendrites."
"This may be a mechanism by which synapses on dendrites are informed that a spike occurred in the soma, and it has relevance for hypotheses about the cellular mechanisms of learning that will be discussed in Chapter 25. So far, we’ve seen that whether or not an EPSP contributes to the action potential output of a neuron depends on several factors, including the number of coactive excitatory synapses, the distance the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone, and the properties of the dendritic membrane. Of course, not all synapses in the brain are excitatory."
The action of some synapses is to take the membrane potential away from action potential threshold; these are called inhibitory synapses. Inhibitory synapses exert a powerful control over a neuron’s output . IPSPs and Shunting Inhibition.
"The postsynaptic receptors under most inhibitory synapses are very similar to those under excitatory synapses; they’re transmitter-gated ion channels. The only important differences are that they bind different neurotransmitters  and that they allow different ions to pass through their channels. The transmitter- gated channels of most inhibitory synapses are permeable to only one natural ion, Cl."
"Opening of the chloride channel allows Cl ions to cross the membrane in a direction that brings the membrane potential toward the chloride equilibrium potential, ECl, about 65 mV. If the membrane potential were less negative than 65 mV when the transmitter was released, activation of these channels would cause a hyperpolarizing IPSP. Notice that if the resting membrane potential were already 65 mV, no IPSP would be visible after chloride channel activation because the value of the membrane potential would already equal ECl ."
"If there is no visible IPSP, is the neuron really inhibited? The answer is yes. Consider the situation illustrated in Figure 5."
"20, with an excitatory synapse on a distal segment of dendrite and an inhibitory synapse on a proximal segment of dendrite, near the soma. Activation of the excitatory synapse leads to the influx of positive charge into the dendrite. This current depolarizes the membrane as it flows toward the soma."
"At the site of the active inhibitory synapse, however, the membrane potential is approximately equal to ECl, 65 mV. Positive current therefore flows outward across the membrane at this site to bring Vm to 65 mV. This synapse acts as an electrical shunt, preventing the current from flowing through the soma to the axon hillock."
"This type of inhibition is called shunting inhibition. The actual physical basis of shunting inhibition is the inward movement of negatively charged chloride ions, which is formally equivalent to outward positive current flow. Shunting inhibition is like cutting a big hole in the leaky garden hose—all the water flows down this path of least resistance, out of the hose, before it gets to the nozzle where it can “activate” the flowers in your garden."
A flash of lightning . . .
a thunderclap . . .
"a tap on the shoulder when you think you’re alone! If you are not expecting them, any of these stimuli can make you jump, grimace, hunch your shoulders, and breathe faster. We all know the brief but dramatic nature of the startle response. Luckily, when lightning strikes twice or a friend taps our shoulder again, we tend to be much less startled the second time."
"We quickly habituate, and relax. However, for an unfortunate minority of mice, cows, dogs, horses, and people, life is a succession of exaggerated startle responses. Even normally benign stimuli, such as hands clapping or a touch to the nose, may trigger an uncontrollable stiffening of the body, an involuntary shout, flexion of the arms and legs, and a fall to the ground."
"Worse yet, these overdone responses don’t adapt when the stimuli are repeated. The clinical term for startle disease is hyperekplexia, and the first recorded cases were members of a community of French-Canadian lumberjacks in 1878. Hyperekplexia is an inherited condition, seen worldwide, and its sufferers are known by colorful local names: the “Jumping Frenchmen of Maine” , “myriachit” , “latah” , and “Ragin’ Cajuns” ."
"We now know the molecular basis for two general types of startle diseases. Remarkably, both involve defects of inhibitory glycine receptors. The first type, identified in humans and in a mutant mouse called spasmodic, is caused by a mutation of a gene for the glycine receptor."
"The change is the smallest one possible—the abnormal receptors have only one amino acid  coded wrong—but the result is a chloride channel that opens less frequently when exposed to the neurotransmitter glycine. The second type of startle disease is seen in the mutant mouse spastic and in a strain of cattle. In these animals, normal glycine receptors are expressed, but in fewer than normal numbers."
"The two forms of startle disease thus take different routes to the same unfortunate end: The transmitter glycine is less effective at inhibiting neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Most neural circuits depend on a delicate balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition for normal functioning. If excitation is increased or inhibition reduced, then a turbulent and hyperexcitable state may result."
An impairment of glycine function yields exaggerated startles; reduced GABA function can lead to the seizures of epilepsy . How can such diseases be treated? There is often a clear and simple logic.
"Drugs that enhance inhibition can be very helpful. The genetic mutations of the glycine system resemble strychnine poisoning. Strychnine is a powerful plant toxin, first isolated in the early nineteenth century."
"It has traditionally been used by farmers to eradicate pesky rodents and by murderers. Strychnine has a simple mechanism of action: It is an antagonist of glycine at its receptor. Mild strychnine poisoning enhances startle and other reflexes, and resembles hyperekplexia."
"High doses nearly eliminate glycine-mediated inhibition in circuits of the spinal cord and brain stem. This leads to uncontrollable seizures and unchecked muscular contractions, spasm and paralysis of the respiratory muscles, and ultimately death from asphyxiation. It is a painful, agonizing way to die; because glycine is not a transmitter in the higher centers of the brain, strychnine itself does not impair cognitive or sensory functions."
"Thus, you can see that the action of inhibitory synapses also contributes to synaptic integration. The IPSPs can be subtracted from EPSPs, making the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fire action potentials. In addition, shunting inhibition acts to drastically reduce rm and consequently 	, thus allowing positive current to flow out across the membrane instead of internally down the dendrite toward the spike-initiation zone."
"The Geometry of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses. Inhibitory synapses in the brain that use GABA or glycine as a neurotransmitter always have a morphology characteristic of Gray’s type II . This structure contrasts with excitatory synapses that use glutamate, which always have a Gray’s type I morphology."
"This correlation between structure and function has been useful for working out the geometric relationships among excitatory and inhibitory synapses on individual neurons. In addition to being spread over the dendrites, inhibitory synapses on many neurons are found clustered on the soma and near the axon hillock, where they are in an especially powerful position to influence the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. Most of the postsynaptic mechanisms we’ve discussed so far involve transmitter receptors that are, themselves, ion channels."
"To be sure, synapses with transmitter-gated channels carry the bulk of the specific information that is processed by the nervous system. However, there are many synapses with G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not directly associated with an ion channel. Synaptic activation of these receptors does not directly evoke EPSPs and IPSPs, but instead modifies the effectiveness of EPSPs generated by other synapses with transmitter-gated channels."
"This type of synaptic transmission is called modulation. We’ll give you a taste for how modulation influences synaptic integration by exploring the effects of activating one type of G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain, the norepinephrine beta  receptor. The binding of the amine neurotransmitter norepinephrine  to the   receptor triggers a cascade of biochemical events within the cell."
"In short, the   receptor activates a G-protein that, in turn, activates an effector protein, the intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the chemical reaction that converts adenosine triphosphate , the product of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, into a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, that is free to diffuse within the cytosol. Thus, the first chemical message of synaptic transmission  is converted by the   receptor into a second message ; cAMP is an example of a second messenger."
"The effect of cAMP is to stimulate another enzyme known as a protein kinase. Protein kinases catalyze a chemical reaction called phosphorylation, the transfer of phosphate groups  from ATP to specific sites on cell proteins . The significance of phosphorylation is that it can change the conformation of a protein, thereby changing that protein’s activity."
"In some neurons, one of the proteins that is phosphorylated when cAMP rises is a particular type of potassium channel in the dendritic membrane. Phosphorylation causes this channel to close, thereby reducing the membrane K conductance. By itself, this does not cause any dramatic effects on the neuron."
"But consider the wider consequence: decreasing the K+ conductance increases the dendritic membrane resistance and therefore increases the length constant. It is like wrapping the leaky garden hose in duct tape; more water can flow down the inside of the hose and less leaks out the sides. As a consequence of increasing 	, distant or weak excitatory synapses will become more effective in depolarizing the spike-initiation zone beyond threshold; the cell will become more excitable."
"Thus, the binding of NE to   receptors produces little change in membrane potential but greatly increases the response produced by another neurotransmitter at an excitatory synapse. Because this effect involves several biochemical intermediaries, it can last far longer than the presence of the modulatory transmitter itself. We have described one particular G-protein-coupled receptor and the consequences of activating it in one type of neuron."
"But it is important to recognize that other types of receptor can lead to the formation of other types of second messenger molecules. Activation of each of these receptor types will initiate a distinct cascade of biochemical reactions in the postsynaptic neuron that do not always include phosphorylation and decreases in membrane conductance. In fact, cAMP in a different cell type with different enzymes may produce functionally opposite changes in the excitability of cells."
"In Chapter 6, we will describe more examples of synaptic modulation and their mechanisms. However, you can already see that modulatory forms of synaptic transmission offer an almost limitless number of ways that information encoded by presynaptic impulse activity can be transformed and used by the postsynaptic neuron. In this chapter, we have covered the basic principles of chemical synaptic transmission."
"The action potential that arose in the sensory nerve when you stepped on that thumbtack in Chapter 3, and swept up the axon in Chapter 4, has now reached the axon terminal in the spinal cord. The depolarization of the terminal triggered the presynaptic entry of Ca2 through voltage-gated calcium channels, which then stimulated exocytosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. Liberated neurotransmitter diffused across the synaptic cleft and attached to specific receptors in the postsynaptic membrane."
"The transmitter  caused transmitter-gated channels to open, which allowed positive charge to enter the postsynaptic dendrite. Because the sensory nerve was firing action potentials at a high rate, and because many synapses were activated at the same time, the EPSPs summed to bring the spike-initiation zone of the postsynaptic neuron to threshold, and this cell then generated action potentials. If the postsynaptic cell were a motor neuron, this activity would cause the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction and muscle contraction."
"If the postsynaptic cell were an interneuron that used GABA as a neurotransmitter, the activity of the cell would result in inhibition of its synaptic targets. If this cell used a modulatory transmitter such as NE, the activity could cause lasting changes in the excitability or metabolism of its synaptic targets. It is this rich diversity of chemical synaptic interactions that allows complex behaviors  to emerge from simple stimuli ."
"Although we surveyed chemical synaptic transmission in this chapter, we did not cover the chemistry of synaptic transmission in any detail. In Chapter 6, we’ll take a closer look at the chemical “nuts and bolts” of different neurotransmitter systems. In Chapter 15, after we’ve examined the sensory and motor systems in Part II, we’ll explore the contributions of several different neurotransmitters to nervous system function and behavior."
"You’ll see that the chemistry of synaptic transmission warrants all this attention because defective neurotransmission is the basis for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. And virtually all psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and illicit, exert their effects at chemical synapses. In addition to providing explanations for aspects of neural information processing and the effects of drugs, knowledge of chemical synaptic transmission is also the key to understanding the neural basis of learning and memory."
"Memories of past experiences are established by modification of the effectiveness of chemical synapses in the brain. Material discussed in this chapter suggests possible sites of modification, ranging from changes in presynaptic Ca2 entry and neurotransmitter release to alterations in postsynaptic receptors or excitability. As we shall see in Chapter 25, all of these changes are likely to contribute to the storage of information by the nervous system."
"Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analyzing electron microscopic  brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5×107 chemical synapses between ~130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster."
"The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome."
"We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs  to outputs , across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species."
"While rudimentary nervous systems existed in more ancient animals , brains evolved perhaps half a billion years ago , and are essential for the generation of sophisticated behaviors. It is widely accepted that dividing a brain into regions is helpful for understanding brain function . Wiring diagrams at the level of neurons and synapses have been controversial ."
"Skepticism flourished  largely due to a lack of technologies that could reconstruct such wiring diagrams . The situation began to change in the 2000s , due to the efforts of a small community of researchers. Here we report a significant milestone attained by these efforts, the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain."
"The brain of Drosophila melanogaster may seem tiny, but its 105 neurons and 108 synapses enable a fly to see, smell, hear, walk, and, of course, fly. Flies engage in dynamic social interactions , navigate over distances , and form long-term memories . Portions of fly brains have been reconstructed from electron microscopic  images, which are sharp enough to reveal the fine branches of neurons and the synapses that connect them."
"The resulting wiring diagrams of neural circuits have provided crucial insights into how the brain generates social , memory-related  or navigation  behaviors. Wiring diagrams of other fly brain regions have been mapped and related to visual , auditory , and olfactory  functions. Similarities with mammalian wiring diagrams  are striking."
The above wiring diagrams and many others from mammals  have come from pieces of brain. But recordings of Drosophila neural activity have revealed nearly brain-wide encoding of sensory  and motor  variables. These studies and others in vertebrates highlight that understanding how the brain processes sensory information or drives behavior will require understanding global information flow at the scale of the entire brain.
"The closest antecedent to our whole brain is the reconstruction of a fly “hemibrain” , a resource that has already become indispensable to Drosophila researchers . It is estimated to contain about 20,000 neurons that are “uncropped,” i. e."
", minimally truncated by the borders of the imaged volume, and 14 million synapses between them. Our reconstruction of an entire adult brain contains 127,978 neurons , and 53 million download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources through a growing ecosystem of software tools . The primary portal to the data is FlyWire Codex , which makes the information visualizable and queryable."
The wiring diagram from our whole brain reconstruction is complete enough to deserve the name “connectome. ” It is a clear leap beyond C. elegans   and the 1st instar larva of Drosophila  .
"Our connectome advances beyond the hemibrain in ways that are not simply numerical. It encompasses the subesophageal zone  of the central brain, important for diverse functions such as gustation and mechanosensation  as well as Eichler et al. ), and containing many of the processes of neurons that descend from the brain to the ventral nerve cord to drive motor behaviors."
"It includes annotations for nearly all sexually-dimorphic neurons, analyzed in a companion paper . Our reconstruction of both optic lobes goes far beyond existing maps of columnar visual circuitry . Connections between the optic lobes and central brain are included, as explored by a companion paper ."
"Also included are neurons that extend into the brain through the nerves and neck connective, which are essential for tracing sensorimotor pathways, as illustrated by the present paper and companion papers . Schlegel et al. have compared our wiring diagram with the hemibrain where they overlap and showed that cell type counts and large strong connections were largely in agreement."
"This means that the combined effects of natural variability across individuals and “noise” due to imperfect reconstruction tend to be modest, so our wiring diagram of a single brain should be useful for studying any normal Drosophila individual. That being said, there are known male-female differences . In addition, Schlegel et al."
"report high variability for principal neurons of the mushroom body, a brain structure required for olfactory learning and memory. Some mushroom body connectivity patterns have even been found to be near random , though deviations from randomness have since been identified . In short, Drosophila wiring diagrams are useful because of their stereotypy, yet also open the door to studies of connectome variation."
"Our reconstruction utilized image acquisition and analysis techniques that are distinct from those used for the hemibrain . However, we have built directly on the hemibrain in an important way. The companion paper by Schlegel et al."
"annotated cell types of central brain neurons, principally by matching them with hemibrain neurons. This approach was enabled by a growing ecosystem of software tools serving interoperability between different fly data sources . Because annotations of cell types are essential for scientific discovery, Schlegel et al."
"should be cited along with the present manuscript by those who use the FlyWire resource. Annotations in the SEZ and optic lobes, largely absent from the hemibrain, were contributed by Drosophila labs in the FlyWire Consortium, as well as by citizen scientists. Synapse predictions  and estimates of neurotransmitter identities  were also contributed by the community."
"In addition to describing the FlyWire resource, this manuscript also presents analyses that illustrate how the data products can be used. Additional whole-brain network analyses are provided in a companion paper . From the connectome with its huge numbers of neurons and synapses, we derive a projectome, a reduced map of projections between 78 fly brain regions known as neuropils ."
"We trace synaptic pathways and analyze information flow from the inputs to the outputs of the brain, across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. In particular, the organization of excitation and inhibition in pathways from photoreceptors in the ocelli to descending motor neurons immediately suggests hypotheses about circuit mechanisms of behavior. Images of an entire adult female fly brain  were previously acquired by serial section transmission EM, and released into the public domain by Zheng et al."
". We previously realigned the EM images , automatically segmented all neurons in the images , created a computational system that allows interactive proofreading of the segmentation, and assembled an online community known as FlyWire . During the initial phase, much proofreading was done by a distributed community of Drosophila labs in the FlyWire Consortium, and focused on neurons of interest to these labs."
"During the later phase, the remaining neurons were mainly proofread by two centralized teams at Princeton and Cambridge, with significant contributions from citizen scientists worldwide. The recruitment and training of proofreaders and their workflows are described in the Methods. Chemical synapses were automatically detected in the images as pairs of presynapse-postsynapse locations ."
The whole brain contains 0. 0188 mm3 of neuropil volume and ~130 million synapses. This works out to 6.
"9 synapses/μm3, much denser than the <1 synapse/μm3 reported for mammalian cortex . The central brain and left and right optic lobes contain 0. 0103, 0."
"0042, and 0. 0043 mm3 of neuropil volume, respectively, with synapse counts in approximately the same proportion. Synapses were combined with proofread neurons to yield the connectome, using the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine ."
"We already showed that FlyWire proofreading can yield accurate results  through comparison with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons that are known to be highly stereotyped across individual flies. A second method is to subject neurons to an additional round of proofreading , which was previously shown to yield few changes . Because proofreading workflows and personnel have changed over time, and accuracy can vary across brain regions, we repeated this evaluation by subjecting 826 neurons from the central brain to a second round of proofreading."
"Relative to the second . A third validation method is to quantify how many of the automatically detected synapses are attached to proofread segments, as opposed to being isolated in tiny “orphan” segments . We found high attachment rates of presynapses  while attachment rates of postsynapses were lower  due to less proofreading and reattachment of twigs which contain most of the postsynapses  ."
"Attachment rates were generally in agreement between the two hemispheres of FlyWire and with the hemibrain  and varied by neuropil . The bottom line is that accuracy of our connectome is state of the art. As with the hemibrain , false negative synapses are the dominant kind of error but false positives exist as well - for this reason all analyses we present below  use a threshold of 5 synapses to determine a connection between two neurons)."
"Assuming that such errors are statistically independent, accuracy is expected to be high for detection of connections involving multiple synapses . FlyWire’s reconstruction remains open for proofreading and annotations and new versions of the resource will be released in future. This allows for the correction of remaining errors as they are discovered and further rounds of validation to be performed."
"Additionally, as explained below, proofreading of photoreceptor axons in the compound eyes is still ongoing. The first public release  has been extensively validated for neurons in the central brain. All neurons in the optic lobe were proofread but additional validation will likely identify and correct minor reconstruction errors."
"Of the 127,978 proofread neurons in FlyWire, 114,423 are fully contained within the brain . These intrinsic neurons  belong to the brain only, in contrast to other neurons that are shared by the brain with other structures. Intrinsic neurons of the brain make up three quarters of the adult fly nervous system , indicating a high degree of centralization in the brain."
"The large fraction is related to the fact that the brain is substantially larger than the ventral nerve cord  . Intrinsic neurons amount to 84% of brain neurons. Their predominance means that the brain primarily communicates with itself, and only secondarily with the outside world."
"The nervous system of the larval fly is less centralized; intrinsic neurons of the brain make up one quarter to one third of its nervous system . The closest structure to a brain in C. elegans is the nerve ring , which is co-located with multiple sensory organs in the worm’s head."
"The nerve ring contains no intrinsic neurons, as all neurons in the nerve ring also extend neurites into the rest of the nervous system. The absence of intrinsic neurons is consistent with the convention that the nerve ring is not commonly called a brain. While the above statistics are based on neuron numbers, they are conceptually related to volume-based measures of encephalization used in studies of brain evolution ."
"For comparison, the rat brain occupies 65% of its central nervous system by volume . Our neuron-based measure of encephalization cannot yet be computed for rodents, but this will become possible as connectomics continues to scale. Brain neurons that are not intrinsic can be divided into two categories, depending on the locations of their cell bodies."
"For afferent  neurons, the cell body is outside the brain, while for efferent  neurons, the cell body is contained in the brain. Overall, it is generally accurate to think of an afferent neuron as a brain input, and an efferent neuron as a brain output. The relation to information flow is actually more subtle, however, as many fly neurites carry some mixture of presynapses and postsynapses on both dendrites and axons ."
"Schlegel et al. exhaustively identified all afferent and efferent neurons contained in cross sections of nerves and the neck connective running between the brain and VNC . Almost 95% of these neurons were in the neck connective, antennal nerve, and maxillary-labial nerve."
"Although afferents are truncated in our reconstruction, Schlegel et al. along with other community members  were able to determine the sensory organs corresponding to 5,362 of the 5,495 non-visual sensory neurons . Non-visual sensory neurons enter the brain through nerves  that mostly terminate in the antennal lobe or the SEZ ; see Ext."
"Data Fig. 1-1 for neuropil definitions). The antennal lobe  is the first relay center for processing of olfactory information, and many of the olfactory receptor neuron  inputs to the AL were reconstructed in the hemibrain as well."
"The SEZ receives more diverse inputs, including the projections of both mechanoreceptor and gustatory receptor neurons - these projections were not contained in the hemibrain. The nerves contained few efferent neurons, among which were head motor neurons  or endocrine neurons  . A large fraction of efferent neurons have branches in the SEZ, including most of the 100 motor neurons."
"Visual afferents are by far the most numerous kind of sensory input, and enter the brain directly rather than through nerves. This is the last class of neuron that remains to be fully proofread. There are photoreceptor axons coming from the compound eyes , ocelli , and eyelets ."
"The neurons traversing the neck connective were grouped into 1,303 efferent  and 2,364 afferent  neurons . In a companion paper, Eichler et al. typed these neurons and matched them to reconstructions from two separate EM datasets of a VNC ."
"Of the 114,423 intrinsic neurons, 32,422 are fully contained in the central brain, and 73,655 are fully contained in the optic lobes and ocellar ganglia . Given that the visual areas dominate the count, it seems safe to say that Drosophila is a highly visual animal. The optic lobes, which are largely absent from the first larval instar, are a major reason that the adult fly brain so dominates its nervous system."
"The optic lobes and ocellar ganglia also contain 7,851 neurons that project into the central brain, so called visual projection neurons . We provide a more detailed analysis of connections in the ocellar ganglion in Fig. 7."
Many VPNs are columnar types that tile the visual field. VPNs target specific neuropils  or optic glomeruli  in the central brain. The influence of VPNs can be very strong; 879 central neurons receive more than half their synapses from VPNs.
"The hemibrain already characterized many VPN types along with their outputs in the central brain . Our whole brain reconstruction reveals many other aspects of VPN connectivity, such as their inputs in the medulla, lobula, or lobula plate - Schlegel et al. have typed these neurons based on their axonal projections in the brain and comparing to reconstructions in the hemibrain ."
"In addition to feedforward targeting of central neurons, VPNs make 20% of their synapses onto other VPNs, and 21% onto optic lobe neurons. Companion papers investigate the visual projections to the central complex  and the mushroom body . There are 494 neurons that project from the central brain to the optic lobes ."
"We call these visual centrifugal neurons , and they are distinct from previously defined types of visual centrifugal neurons that are fully contained in the optic lobe, and their functions are mostly unknown. VCNs are 15× less numerous than VPNs. Nevertheless, half of all optic lobe neurons receive 5 or more synapses from VCNs, showing that much early visual processing incorporates feedback from the central brain."
"Centrifugal inputs to the retina are found in many vertebrate species, including humans . Many VCNs arborize broadly in the optic lobe, appearing to cover the entire visual field. Some VCNs, however, cover only a subset of columns within a portion of the visual field."
"A few optic lobe neurons receive as many as 50% of their synapses from VCNs. These belong to the class of peptidergic neurons involved in circadian rhythmicity, which are detailed in a companion paper . Tm5c is a columnar type ) with more than 10% of its input from VCNs."
"A lamina wide-field neuron  can receive more than 10% of its input from VCNs, and a major input source is octopaminergic . It was previously shown that gain modulation of Lawf2 neurons increases during flight , and this effect is mimicked by bath application of octopamine. Transcriptomic studies showed that Lawf2 neurons express octopamine receptors at high levels ."
"The neuron classes introduced above are organized into a hierarchy, as explained in our companion paper . The three “flow” classes  are divided into nine “super-classes” mentioned above . A simplified representation of the connectome as a graph in which nodes are super-classes is shown in Fig."
"2b. Node sizes reflect neuron number, and link widths indicate connection number. This is the first of several simplified representations that we will introduce to tame the complexity of the connectome."
"Before continuing in this vein, we pause to discuss the properties of individual neurons and synapses. A basic property of the fly brain is that cell bodies are spatially segregated from neurites. Cell bodies reside near the surface  of the brain , surrounding a synapse-rich interior that mainly consists of entangled neurons and glia, fiber bundles or tracts, as well as tubules of the tracheal system ."
"A typical non-sensory Drosophila neuron is unipolar and consists of a primary neurite that leaves the cell body , enters the neuropil, and branches into secondary and higher-order neurites . Secondary neurites can sometimes be classified as axons if presynapses clearly dominate, or dendrites if postsynapses clearly dominate . Such an axon-dendrite distinction was made, for example, when defining visual projection and centrifugal neurons above."
"But some mixture of presynapses and postsynapses is generally found on all non-primary neurites . In addition, the soma of insect neurons is separated from the main processes via a typically thin neural filament . Given this structure, the concept that signals pass from dendrites to soma to axon, which is often a good approximation for mammalian neurons, does not apply for non-sensory neurons in the fly."
Neurons vary greatly in size and shape . We computed skeletons for all reconstructed neurons  to measure neuronal path lengths. The median path length of a neuronal arbor was 656 μm .
"It has been argued that branched arbors are optimal for achieving a high degree of connectivity with other neurons . Neurons with short path lengths are exceptions, and can be found in both the optic lobes and central brain. Path length and volume both varied over two orders of magnitude ."
"In total, the brain contains ~146 m of neuronal path length. Sizes vary significantly between different cell superclasses . Optic lobe neurons are on average much shorter than central brain neurons  and take up a smaller volume , which is why the optic lobes dominate the brain by neuron number but not by volume or synapse count."
"Visual centrifugal neurons are among the largest in the brain, and larger on average than visual projection neurons . While we measured much shorter path lengths and volumes for afferent neurons because only part of their axonal arbors is contained within the brain , arbors of efferents, motor and descending neurons which also have some of their arbor outside the brain, were among the largest we measured . A small fraction of brain volume is glial cells, which are categorized in six types ."
We estimated that 13% of the cell bodies in the EM dataset are non-neuronal or glial . Only a few astrocyte-like glia have been proofread . Sheet-like fragments of ensheathing glia are readily found near fiber bundles in the automated reconstruction.
Further proofreading of glia could be prioritized in the future if there is community demand. Our connectome includes only chemical synapses; the identification of electrical synapses awaits a future EM dataset with higher resolution . We use the term “synapse” to mean chemical synapse.
"A Drosophila synapse is generally polyadic, meaning that a single presynapse communicates with multiple target postsynapses . FlyWire represents a polyadic synapse as multiple synapses, each of which is a pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic locations . Polyadic synapses are common in other invertebrate species, such as C."
"elegans, and exist in some mammalian brain structures . We define a connection from neuron A to neuron B as the set of synapses from A to B. A connection typically contains multiple synapses, and the number can be large ."
"Connections with less than 10 synapses are typical, but a single connection can comprise >100 synapses  or even >1,000 synapses . The strongest connection was from a visual centrifugal neuron  onto a wide field lobula neuron , and contained over 2300 synapses. These numbers are much larger than the report of a maximum of 41 synapses connecting a pair of C."
"elegans neurons . To model such a distribution with a long tail,  used a power law with exponential cutoff . Our fit found comparable parameters, but the fit to our whole-brain distribution of connection strengths was not as good as their fit to the hemibrain distribution."
"A similar power law is also a reasonable fit to the distribution of connection strengths in C. elegans. Setting a threshold of ≥5 synapses for determining a  connection is likely to be adequate for avoiding false positives in the dataset, but not missing connections ."
"There are 2,613,129 such connections between the 124,891 identified neurons. There are several reasons to focus on strong connections. First, a connection with many synapses is expected to be strong in a physiological sense, other things being equal."
"Second, strong connections are likely to be more reproducible across individuals . Third, higher accuracy  of automatic detection is expected for strong connections, assuming that errors are statistically independent . One of the most basic properties of a node in any network is its degree, the number of nodes to which it is linked."
"To characterize the degree distribution in the Drosophila connectome, we focused on intrinsic neurons  because, unlike afferent and efferent neurons, they do not suffer from undercounting of connections due to truncation. For any neuron, in-degree is defined as its number of presynaptic partners , and out-degree is defined as its number of postsynaptic partners . The median in-degree and out-degree of intrinsic neurons are 11 and 13 , respectively, with the restriction mentioned above to connections involving five or more synapses."
"These median values do not seem dramatically different from the median in-degree and out-degree of 10 and 19 for neurons in the C. elegans hermaphrodite, considering that the latter contains several hundred times fewer neurons than Drosophila. The neuron in the Drosophila brain with maximum degree is a visual GABAergic interneuron , with 6329 postsynaptic partners and 4999 presynaptic partners."
"CT1 arborizes exclusively in the medulla neuropil of the optic lobe - indeed, most neuropils of the Drosophila brain contain one or a few large GABAergic neurons private to that neuropil, with high in-degree and out-degree ; these neurons are considered to be important for local feedback gain control . In a C. elegans hermaphrodite , the neuron with maximum degree is a command interneuron for backward locomotion , with 110 postsynaptic partners and 64 presynaptic partners."
"The existence of neurons with much higher degree is a marked way in which the Drosophila connectome differs from that of C. elegans. That being said, the degree of AVAL is large in a relative sense because it is a large fraction of the total C."
"elegans neuron number . The number of synapses established by a neuron is correlated with its total neurite path length , R=0. 89 , Ext."
Data Fig. 3-1g). Presynapse and postsynapse counts are similarly correlated per neuron .
We asked whether large neurons tend to use their many synapses to create stronger connections with individual neurons versus more connections with many different neurons. The total number of synapses established by a neuron was much better correlated with its in and out degrees  than its average connection strength . It remains to be tested whether the additional partners are from the same or different cell types.
"Connections and neurons are not necessarily the functional units of neural computation. For certain large fly neurons, the arbors are composed of multiple compartments that function somewhat independently . Perhaps these subcellular compartments, rather than whole cells, should be regarded as nodes of the connectome."
"Then CT1 would be replaced by many nodes with lower degrees. And the connection from LT39 to mALC2 would be replaced by many connections with fewer synapses between compartments of these neurons. A connectome of neuronal compartments can in principle be studied using our resource, which includes the location of every synapse."
"A statistical prediction of the small molecule neurotransmitter  secreted by each neuron is available. A number of validations suggest that the predictions are highly accurate in aggregate , though for any given synapse the prediction could be wrong. We assume that every neuron secretes a single small molecule neurotransmitter and combine the predictions for all outgoing synapses to an estimate which we assign to all outgoing synapses of a neuron, i."
"e. we assume neurons obey Dale’s law, although it is known that co-transmission does occur in the fly brain . GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons had much higher degrees than cholinergic neurons ."
"Across all neuron categories, we found that GABAergic neurons were on average longer than glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons . As a rule, we will assume that cholinergic neurons are excitatory and GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons are inhibitory. A companion paper identifies all GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that are bidirectionally coupled with large numbers of cholinergic neurons ."
"This reciprocal inhibitory-excitatory motif is widespread throughout the fly brain . For mammals, tracer injection studies have mapped the axonal projections between brain regions of mouse  and macaque . In fly, large numbers of light microscopic reconstructions of single neurons have been aggregated to map projections between brain regions ."
"Such maps have been called projectomes  or mesoscale connectomes . In such techniques, the sampling of axons is difficult to control, which means that accurate quantification of projection strength is challenging. Here we compute a projectome from a synapse-level connectome ."
"The interior of the fly brain has been subdivided into hierarchical neuropil regions  . Our fly projectome is defined as a map of projections between these neuropil regions. Because cell bodies are spatially separated from neuropils, a fly neuron cannot typically be assigned to a single brain region."
"This is unlike the situation for a mammalian neuron, which is conventionally assigned to the region containing its cell body. A typical fly neuron belongs to multiple neuropils. The projectome is a neuropil-neuropil matrix computed as follows."
Each intrinsic neuron contributes to the projections between neuropils where it has pre- and postsynaptic sites. We weighted neuron projections by the product of the respective number of synapses and normalized the result for every neuron such that the matrix sums to the total number of intrinsic neurons. Each column corresponds to all the neurons projecting to a neuropil and each row to all neurons projecting out of it .
"Each square then represents the summed fractional weight of all neurons projecting between two neuropils . We added afferent and efferent neurons to the matrix by calculating the sum of the weighted neuron projections per super class to and from all neuropils respectively. While each neuropil is connected to many others, most neurons have synaptic sites in only a few neuropils ."
"We repeated this process for each fast neurotransmitter type . Some neuropil-neuropil connections exist strongly for one neurotransmitter but not others. For example, the neuropils making up the central complex  and the mushroom body  are largely tied together by excitatory connections."
"We observed a strong symmetry between projections in the left and right hemisphere as well as with the central neuropils located on the midline ; this highlights the strong similarity between the two sides of the brain. We observed that contralateral projections  were generally weaker than projections to the same or ipsilateral neuropil . The SEZ  is the ventral portion of the central brain, and has been shown to contribute to a variety of behaviors ."
"It is almost wholly unrepresented in the hemibrain reconstruction , and is also unreconstructed in the larval brain . The five neuropils in the SEZ  amount to 17. 8% of central brain neuropil volume ; they contain afferents mostly from non-visual sensory neurons  and ascending neurons, as well as a large number of efferents ."
"The SEZ is thus important for information flow to and from the brain. Judging from the projectome , the SEZ neuropils interact with almost all parts of the brain. Notable exceptions are the central complex  and the mushroom body , suggesting less crosstalk between those circuits and neurons in the SEZ ."
"Our reconstruction includes both left and right brain hemispheres. This is important for tracing sensorimotor pathways that cross from one side to the other, and more generally for understanding interactions between the two hemispheres. The projectome  already reveals that most projections  are ipsilateral or between neuropils on the same side of the brain."
"The low fraction of non-ipsilateral neurons is primarily due to their scarceness in the optic lobes. Only 157 neurons  in the optic lobes cross hemispheres, and cross the central brain without making synapses there  - these neurons are considered to be “fully contained” in the optic lobes because our definition depends only on synapse locations. These neurons mediate direct interactions between the two optic lobes, and their rarity suggests that these interactions represent a smaller fraction of the computations that occur within the optic lobes."
"Integration of information from both eyes may rely more on the abundant crossing connections between the central brain targets  of VPNs. A higher proportion  of central brain neurons are non-ipsilateral, largely owing to central neuropils, like those of the central complex and SEZ. To classify non-ipsilateral neurons, we started by examining the spatial distributions of their postsynapses ."
We divided the neuropils into three categories. Left and Right included the neuropils that come in mirror-symmetric pairs. Center included the seven remaining neuropils that are located on the midline.
"For each neuron, we computed the proportions of its postsynapses in Left, Right, and Center neuropils . Each neuron was assigned to the dominant category, and near-ties were rare. The exceptions are symmetric neurons with cell bodies at the midline of the brain ."
"Next, we asked how many neurons of Left and Right categories have presynapses  in the other hemisphere. Similar to the analysis of the 1st instar larval connectome , we found that neurons projecting to the other hemisphere can be grouped into bilateral neurons, those with outputs in both hemispheres, and contralateral neurons which almost exclusively had presynapses in the other hemisphere . Notably, many more visual centrifugal neurons projected to the contralateral hemisphere than visual projection neurons, and both visual centrifugal neurons and neurons of the central brain contain a large fraction of bilateral neurons  - as stated earlier, this analysis again revealed the dominance of ipsilateral connections in the brain."
"While mixing between the hemispheres is more rare, mixing between sensory modalities within a hemisphere is common . Many types of fly neurons are known to exhibit striking stereotypy across individuals, and also across both hemispheres of the same individual. A companion paper shows quantitatively using FlyWire and hemibrain data that these two kinds of stereotypy are similar in degree ."
"So far we have mentioned neurons that connect the optic lobes with each other, or with the central brain. The intricate circuitry within each optic lobe is also included in FlyWire’s connectome. Photoreceptor axons terminate in the lamina and medulla, neuropils of the optic lobes ."
Each eye contains approximately 800 ommatidia that map to columns in the lamina arranged in a hexagonal lattice . This structure repeats in subsequent neuropils from lamina to medulla to lobula to lobula plate. The neuropils have been finely subdivided into layers that are perpendicular to the columns .
The 2D visual field is mapped onto each layer. Any given cell type prefers to synapse in some subset of the layers. Cell types vary greatly in size.
Uni-columnar cell types are the smallest . At the other extreme are large cells that span almost all columns . In between there are many multi-columnar cell types that are still being classified .
"Mi1 is a true “tiling” type, i. e. , its arbors cover the visual field with little or no overlap, and have similar size and shape ."
"Dm12 arbors overlap with each other, but the spatial arrangement is still regular. These and other distal medullary cell types were previously characterized by multicolor light microscopy . Our EM reconstructions reveal even more detailed information about the spatial patterning of these types ."
"More importantly, FlyWire’s reconstruction encompasses all multi-columnar cell types, including those outside the medulla. Judging from the many examples we have studied throughout the optic lobe, it seems that regular coverage of the visual field without gaps is a defining criterion for most cell types, similar to mammalian retina . There are, however, exceptional cell types that cover the visual field in an irregular manner."
"For example, there are exactly two LPi1-2 cells per optic lobe . The shapes of each pair are complementary, as if they were created by cutting the visual field into two pieces with a jigsaw ; this tiling was not evident when reconstructing only a portion of an optic lobe . Much of the existing research on widefield visual motion processing has relied on the simplifying idea that the computations are mostly in columnar circuits, and the columnar outputs are finally integrated by large tangential cells in the lobula plate."
"This research has been aided by wiring diagrams containing connections between cells in the same column or neighboring columns . An absence of information across columns, has necessitated treating each column as identical in simulations of the optic lobe . FlyWire’s connectome contains not only the columnar neurons , but also all neurons that extend across columns ."
"These neurons are both excitatory and inhibitory, and can support interactions between even distant columns. This opens up the possibility of a much richer understanding of optic lobe computations, and this is explored in a companion paper on hue selectivity . Some columnar cell types are known to exhibit spatial gradients in connectivity , and our reconstruction makes it possible to investigate such gradients for any columnar cell type in the optic lobe."
"Similar gradients have also been studied in mammalian retina , and such continuous variation is an interesting complement to the conventional notion that cell types are discrete. While afferent and efferent neurons make up a numerically small proportion of the brain , they are important because they connect the brain to the outside world. Examining connections to these neurons is useful when attempting to predict the functions of intrinsic neurons from the connectome."
"For example, one might try to identify the shortest path in the connectome from an afferent  neuron that leads to a given intrinsic neuron. The sensory modality of the afferent neuron could provide a clue as to the function of the intrinsic neuron. This approach, while intuitive, ignores connection strengths and multiplicities of parallel pathways."
"We therefore use a probabilistic model  to estimate information flow in the connectome, starting from a set of seed neurons . The likelihood of a neuron being traversed increases with the fraction of inputs from already traversed neurons and caps out at an input fraction of 30%. We ran the traversal model for every subset of afferent neurons as seeds ."
"We then measured information flow from these starting neurons to all intrinsic and efferent neurons of the central brain  as efferents of the central brain). We then ranked all neurons by their traversal distance from each set of starting neurons and normalized the order to percentiles. For instance, a neuron at the 20th percentile had a lower rank than 80% of neurons."
"This allowed us to determine how early information from each afferent modality reached various targets, including the descending neurons, endocrine neurons, motor neurons and visual centrifugal neurons . As expected, endocrine neurons are closest to the gustatory sensory neurons while motor and descending neurons were reached early for mechanosensory and visual afferents . Do the afferent cell classes target inhibitory neurons early or late?"
"We found that putative inhibitory neurons  were overrepresented in the set of early neurons . Surprisingly, we identified a sequence of GABAergic and glutamatergic peaks in the sequence of neurons targeted that was replicated for almost all afferent modalities . To visualize information flow in a common space, we treated the traversal distances starting from each seed population as a neuron embedding and built a UMAP projection from all of these embeddings ."
"Within the map, we found that neurons of the same cell class  are clustered. Next, we displayed traversal order on top of the UMAP plot to compare traversal orders starting from different modalities. We find that every neuron in the central brain can be reached by starting from any modality - this “small world” property of the network is covered in more detail in a companion paper ."
"Comparing orders revealed that almost all neurons in the central brain are reached early starting from some modality, with the exception of neurons in the central complex , highlighting that the central complex is dominated by internal computations . Kenyon cells were contained in two clusters - one of which is targeted very early from olfactory receptor neurons and the other targeted early by visual projection neurons . Our information flow analysis provides a compressed representation of the connectome, but ignores signs of connections and the biophysics of neurons and synapses, and therefore terms like “early” and “late” should not be interpreted as true latencies to sensory stimulation."
"A companion paper  builds a leaky integrate-and-fire model of Drosophila brain dynamics, using the connectome and including connection weights  and putative connection signs . Neurons in Drosophila are considered to be identifiable across hemispheres and individuals , enabling cell type classification of all neurons in FlyWire - such classification is useful for generating testable hypotheses about circuit function from the connectome. FlyWire community members, experts in diverse regions of the fly brain, have shared 91,649 annotations of 59,548 neurons , including the majority of sexually-dimorphic neurons , sensory neurons , as well as a diversity of cell types in the optic lobes and SEZ , two brain regions not covered in the hemibrain connectome."
"Each neuron in FlyWire is given a unique name based on the neuropil it receives and sends most of its synapses. Curation of these annotations continues, and we invite further community efforts to identify cell types, and these can be contributed through Codex . In addition, matching between cell types identified in the hemibrain  and both hemispheres of FlyWire provides additional annotations for neurons contained in both datasets."
"Our companion paper  provides cell type annotations for 26,150 neurons via such matching. All cell annotations can be queried in Codex. Some of these have already been mentioned, such as the “flow” annotations of intrinsic vs."
"afferent vs. efferent, super-class annotations of Fig. 2, neurotransmitter predictions, left-right annotations for cell body location, in addition to lineages, or groups of neurons derived from a single neuroblast ."
"The completeness of the FlyWire connectome enables tracing complete pathways from sensory inputs to motor outputs - here we demonstrate this capability by examining circuits that emanate from the ocellar ganglion and leveraging cell type information. In addition to the large compound eyes, flying insects have smaller visual sensory organs , including the three ocelli on the dorsal surface of the head cuticle . The ocelli are under-focused eyes, projecting a blurry image of light level changes in the UV and blue color spectrum ; these eyes are thought to be useful for flight control and orientation relative to the horizon ."
"Importantly, while the role of the ocelli has been hypothesized , little is known about the circuitry downstream of this sensory organ that would mediate this function. Photoreceptor axons  from the three ocelli innervate three distinct regions of the ocellar ganglion separated by glial sheets . The ocellar ganglion additionally contains 62 neurons that we categorized into four broad groups : local neurons , two types of interneurons, divided based on their arborizations and caliber , OCG02 ), descending neurons , and centrifugal or feedback neurons ."
"Ocellar local neurons are small  and connect sparsely with photoreceptors from all ocelli. Twelve OCG01 interneurons and two descending neurons  represent the main pathway from the ocellar ganglion to the central brain. DNp28 projects to the intermediate, haltere, wing, and neck tectula of the ventral nerve cord ."
"In each ocellus, half of the OCG01s were inferred to express glutamate , and the other half acetylcholine . There are four OCG01s per ocellus . OCG01s tile the ocellar ganglion, indicating their receptive fields tile the visual fields of the ocelli ."
"OCG02 axons are much thinner than the OCG01s, and likely transmit signals slower. Two OCG02 subgroups  innervate similar neuropils to the OCG01s , and OCG02c neurons target the PLP, a brain region that also receives input from visual projection neurons from the compound eyes . Neurons downstream from OCG01s in the IPS, SPS, and GNG receive inhibitory input from the ipsilateral ocellus and excitatory input from the contralateral ocellus , and the amount of synaptic input from each ocellus is tightly correlated  - this balance is likely to be a key ingredient in how signals are integrated ."
"We found that 15 different descending neurons  each receive over 200 synapses from the OCG01 neurons. For example, two DNs in each hemisphere received over 30% of their synaptic inputs in the brain from ocellar projection neurons: DNp20/DNOVS1 , DNp22/DNOVS2 . DNOVS1 and other descending neurons with strong input from OCG01s generally receive strong input from ipsilateral visual projection neurons as well ."
"For example, DNOVS1 is also activated by rotational optic flow fields across the compound eye, and projects to the neck motor system . A handful of glutamatergic  visual projection neurons sparsely innervate descending neurons in both hemispheres. As the ocelli transmit mainly information about light levels, the dense integration with motion direction signals from the compound eyes was not previously appreciated, but should aid in precision adjustments of head and body movements for gaze stabilization and flight control ."
"There is also extensive feedback from the brain directly to the ocellar ganglion via 25 ocellar centrifugal neurons . We found striking targeting specificity of two OCC subgroups  which synapse onto all OCG01 and DNp28 neurons with strong connections compared with their overall synaptic budget . The OCC01s receive input in a wide range of neuropils, notably the SEZ, as well as IPS and SPS, the same neuropils that receive inputs from the OCG projection neurons ."
"It remains to be determined what role the OCCs play in gating visual information and potentially driving the OCGs in the absence of photoreceptor activity. Based on the summary wiring diagram of Fig. 7f, we hypothesize how the pathways from the ocelli to descending neurons function."
"As in a Braitenberg vehicle for phototaxis , excitation and inhibition are organized so that the head and body of the fly should roll around the anteroposterior axis to orient the ocelli towards light. In this example, the whole-brain connectome, extending from brain inputs to outputs, uncovers new pathways and facilitates the generation of putative circuit mechanisms of sensorimotor behavior. By reconstructing a complete brain wiring diagram, FlyWire enables many kinds of studies that were not previously possible using wiring diagrams of portions of the fly brain."
"The optic lobes and the SEZ are two prominent regions mostly missing from the hemibrain, the previous state of the art. Both sides of the brain are included, enabling the tracing of pathways that cross the midline. Due to the presence of afferent and efferent neurons, one can trace pathways from sensory inputs to intrinsic neurons to brain outputs ."
"This was done in a global fashion using the information flow model, and more specifically to uncover the structure and hypothesize a circuit mechanism for behaviors supported by the ocelli. Our companion papers provide additional global analyses of the connectome  and studies of specific families of pathways. Connectome annotation with structural and functional information is an important emerging field, analogous to genome annotation."
"Annotations are important because they make the connectome usable for hypothesis generation about circuit function. We carried out a hierarchical and systematic annotation of all neurons in the connectome as detailed in our companion paper , describing over 4000 robustly identifiable cell types. We also collected a large number of annotations from the community  leveraging a broad knowledge base - further curation of these labels will help to refine them."
"For the first time, one can now compare entire connectomes of different species, starting with Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans, as touched on by the present manuscript, and explored in more depth by Lin et al . One can also compare connectomes of the same species at different developmental stages ."
"While ours is still the only adult fly connectome, it can be compared with the hemibrain reconstruction where they overlap, to detect wiring differences between adults of the same species . Transcriptomics with single cell resolution is being applied to mammalian brains  2021), and to the Drosophila brain as well. Transcriptomic atlases of the central adult brain  and optic lobes  are appearing."
Comparing connectomes with transcriptomes is already proving useful for studying molecular mechanisms of development . Clearly more fly connectomes at multiple developmental stages are needed. Connectome-based brain simulation was one of the original motivations for connectomics .
"A neural network simulation of visual motion detection based on the wiring diagram of columnar circuits in the optic lobe has been created . Such a connectome-based approach can at last be scaled up to an entire brain, as shown by Shiu et al. ."
"The hemibrain was reconstructed  from images acquired by FIB-SEM , a form of block face EM . FlyWire is based on transmission EM images of serial sections  that were manually cut and collected , an evolution of the approach that was used for the C. elegans connectome ."
"In the end, both block face and serial section EM have turned out to be viable for fly connectomes. Both approaches yield similar accuracy . Hybrid methods that combine both imaging approaches are also being developed ."
"Owing to the use of artificial intelligence , the hemibrain and FlyWire have yielded connectomes that are orders of magnitude larger than those of C. elegans  or the larval fly . The hemibrain images were automatically segmented using flood-filling convolutional nets , whereas FlyWire used the older approach of boundary-detecting convolutional nets ."
"FlyWire also required another kind of AI, alignment of serial section images using convolutional nets . The improved alignment was crucial for making ssTEM as amenable as block face to automated reconstruction . In spite of enormous progress in AI, both the hemibrain  and FlyWire  required an estimated 50 and 30 person-years of human effort for proofreading the automated segmentation respectively ."
"This is because AI has reduced the amount of human labor required per unit brain volume, but EM image volumes have increased even faster. Further reduction in human proofreading is necessary for reconstructing many fly connectomes to study variation, or to scale up to whole mammalian brains. The EM images used by FlyWire were acquired at a resolution of 4×4×40 nm3."
"Sharpening this resolution would presumably enable accurate attachment of twigs to backbones, which is currently the main factor limiting the accuracy of reconstructing synaptic connectivity. Higher resolution might also enable the reconstruction of electrical synapses, which are included in the C. elegans connectome."
Increasing resolution by 2× in all three dimensions would increase the data volume by 8×. Handling much larger data volumes should be possible as methods for acquiring and analyzing EM images are progressing rapidly. Imaging a larger volume would open up other interesting opportunities.
"Imaging a whole fly CNS would enable the mapping of all pathways linking the brain and VNC. The volume of the whole CNS is not much larger than that of the brain. In the meantime, it is possible to establish correspondences between FlyWire and FANC, a reconstruction of a separate VNC ."
"The first C. elegans connectome was obtained similarly as a mosaic drawn from multiple worms . Imaging an entire fly, both CNS and body, would enable the addition of sensory organs and muscles to the reconstruction."
"This also has precedent in the C. elegans connectome, which includes neuromuscular junctions, and the first instar Drosophila larva for which a whole-animal EM dataset was recently published . FlyWire and other related technologies have already been applied to millimeter-scale chunks of mammalian brain , which are >50× larger in volume than a fly brain."
The U. S. National Institutes of Health is planning a ten year project to reconstruct a whole mouse brain from an exabyte of EM images and a report from the Wellcome trust recently examined the road to a whole mouse brain connectome .
"The 1996 Bermuda Principles mandated daily release of Human Genome Project sequences into the public domain . We believe that openness is also important for large-scale connectomics projects, particularly because these projects are expensive, require coordinated effort, and take several years to complete - sharing connectomes only after proofreading and annotation are completed prevents scientific discovery that can occur while the connectome is being completed. Shortly after its inception, FlyWire has been open to any Drosophila researcher."
"As a result, hundreds of scientists and proofreaders from over 50 labs joined FlyWire with over 200 of them contributing over 100 edits  and 86 contributing ten or more annotations . As a result, there are multiple studies that used completed portions of FlyWire’s connectome as proofreading proceeded . Openness has also enabled FlyWire to move faster by incorporating data sources from the community."
The EM data on which FlyWire is built was shared in 2018 by Bock and colleagues . FlyWire’s synapse data was previously published by Buhmann et al. who incorporated synapse segmentations from Heinrich et al.
", neurotransmitter labels for every synapse were made available ahead of publication by Eckstein et al. , numerous annotations were contributed by Schlegel et al. , and over 90K  cell annotations have been shared by the community."
"Meshes for individual neuropils were based on work by Ito et al. . More specifically, we took meshes previously generated from a full brain segmentation of the JFRC2 template brain which are also used by the Virtual Fly Brain project ."
"These meshes were moved from JFRC2 into FlyWire  space through a series of non-rigid transforms. In addition, we also generated two neuropil meshes for the laminae and for the ocellar ganglion. For these, the FlyWire synapse cloud was voxelized with 2 μm isotropic resolution, meshed using the marching cube algorithm using Python and manually post-processed in Blender 3d."
"We calculated a volume for each neuropil using its mesh. In the aggregated volumes presented in the paper we assigned the lamina, medulla, accessory medulla, lobula, lobula plate to the optic lobe. The remaining neuropils but the ocellar ganglion were assigned to the central brain."
We assigned synapses to neuropils based on their presynaptic location. We used ncollpyde  to calculate if the location was within a neuropil mesh and assigned the synapse accordingly. Some synapses remained unassigned after this step because the neuropils only resemble rough outlines of the underlying data.
We then assigned all remaining synapses to the closest neuropil if the synapse was within 10 μm from it. The remaining synapses were left unassigned. Our reconstruction used the FAFB EM dataset .
"A number of consortium members  alerted us that the FAFB imagery seemed left-right inverted based on cell types innervating the asymmetric body . Eventually a left-right inversion during FAFB imaging was confirmed. All side annotations in figures, in Codex and elsewhere are based on the true biological side."
"For technical reasons we were unable to invert the underlying FAFB image data and therefore continue to show images and reconstructions in the same orientation as  although we now know in such frontal views the fly’s left is on the viewer’s left. For full details of this issue including approaches to display FAFB and other brain data with the correct chirality, please see our companion paper . Inside our heads, weighing about 1."
"5 kg, is an astonishing living organ consisting of billions of tiny cells. It enables us to sense the world around us, to think and to talk. The human brain is the most complex organ of the body, and arguably the most complex thing on earth."
"This booklet is an introduction for young students. In this booklet, we describe what we know about how the brain works and how much there still is to learn. Its study involves scientists and medical doctors from many disciplines, ranging from molecular biology through to experimental psychology, as well as the disciplines of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology."
Their shared interest has led to a new discipline called neuroscience - the science of the brain. The brain described in our booklet can do a lot but not everything. It has nerve cells - its building blocks - and these are connected together in networks.
These networks are in a constant state of electrical and chemical activity. The brain we describe can see and feel. It can sense pain and its chemical tricks help control the uncomfortable effects of pain.
"It has several areas devoted to co-ordinating our movements to carry out sophisticated actions. A brain that can do these and many other things doesn’t come fully formed: it develops gradually and we describe some of the key genes involved. When one or more of these genes goes wrong, various conditions develop, such as dyslexia."
There are similarities between how the brain develops and the mechanisms responsible for altering the connections between nerve cells later on - a process called neuronal plasticity. Plasticity is thought to underlie learning and remembering. Our booklet’s brain can remember telephone numbers and what you did last Christmas.
"Regrettably, particularly for a brain that remembers family holidays, it doesn’t eat or drink. So it’s all a bit limited. But it does get stressed, as we all do, and we touch on some of the hormonal and molecular mechanisms that can lead to extreme anxiety - such as many of us feel in the run-up to examinations."
"That’s a time when sleep is important, so we let it have the rest it needs. Sadly, it can also become diseased and injured. New techniques, such as special electrodes that can touch the surface of cells, optical imaging, human brain scanning machines, and silicon chips containing artificial brain circuits are all changing the face of modern neuroscience."
We introduce these to you and touch on some of the ethical issues and social implications emerging from brain research. There are three main kinds of neurons. Sensory neurons are coupled to receptors specialised to detect and respond to different attributes of the internal and external environment.
"The receptors sensitive to changes in light, sound, mechanical and chemical stimuli subserve the sensory modalities of vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. When mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli to the skin exceed a certain intensity, they can cause tissue damage and a special set of receptors called nociceptors are activated; these give rise both to protective reflexes and to the sensation of pain . Motor neurons, which control the activity of muscles, are responsible for all forms of behaviour including speech."
Interposed between sensory and motor neurons are Interneurones. These are by far the most numerous . Interneurons mediate simple reflexes as well as being responsible for the highest functions of the brain.
"Glial cells, long thought to have a purely supporting function to the neurons, are now known to make an important contribution to the development of the nervous system and to its function in the adult brain. While much more numerous, they do not transmit information in the way that neurons do. Neurons have an architecture that consists of a cell body and two sets of additional compartments called ‘processes’."
One of these sets are called axons; their job is to transmit information from the neuron on to others to which it is connected. The other set are called dendrites - their job is to receive the information being transmitted by the axons of other neurons. Both of these processes participate in the specialised contacts called synapses .
"Neurons are organised into complex chains and networks that are the pathways through which information in the nervous system is transmitted. The brain and spinal cord are connected to sensory receptors and muscles through long axons that make up the peripheral nerves. The spinal cord has two functions: it is the seat of simple reflexes such as the knee jerk and the rapid withdrawal of a limb from a hot object or a pinprick, as well as more complex reflexes, and it forms a highway between the body and the brain for information travelling in both directions."
"These basic structures of the nervous system are the same in all vertebrates. What distinguishes the human brain is its large size in relation to body size. This is due to an enormous increase in the number of interneurons over the course of evolution, providing humans with an immeasurably wide choice of reactions to the environment."
"The brain consists of the brain stem and the cerebral hemispheres. The brain stem is divided into hind-brain, mid-brain and a ‘between-brain’ called the diencephalon. The hind-brain is an extension of the spinal cord."
"It contains networks of neurons that constitute centres for the control of vital functions such as breathing and blood pressure. Within these are networks of neurons whose activity controls these functions. Arising from the roof of the hind-brain is the cerebellum, which plays an absolutely central role in the control and timing of movements ."
"The midbrain contains groups of neurons, each of which seem to use predominantly a particular type of chemical messenger, but all of which project up to cerebral hemispheres. It is thought that these can modulate the activity of neurons in the higher centres of the brain to mediate such functions as sleep, attention or reward. The diencephalon is divided into two very different areas called the thalamus and the hypothalamus: The thalamus relays impulses from all sensory systems to the cerebral cortex, which in turn sends messages back to the thalamus."
"This back-and-forward aspect of connectivity in the brain is intriguing - information doesn’t just travel one way. The hypothalamus controls functions such as eating and drinking, and it also regulates the release of hormones involved in sexual functions. The cerebral hemispheres consist of a core, the basal ganglia, and an extensive but thin surrounding sheet of neurons making up the grey matter of the cerebral cortex."
"The basal ganglia play a central role in the initiation and control of movement. . Packed into the limited space of the skull, the cerebral cortex is thrown into folds that weave in and out to enable a much larger surface area for the sheet of neurons than would otherwise be possible."
"This cortical tissue is the most highly developed area of the brain in humans - four times bigger than in gorillas. It is divided into a large number of discrete areas, each distinguishable in terms of its layers and connections. The functions of many of these areas are known - such as the visual, auditory, and olfactory areas, the sensory areas receiving from the skin  and various motor areas."
"The pathways from the sensory receptors to the cortex and from cortex to the muscles cross over from one side to the other. Thus movements of the right side of the body are controlled by the left side of the cortex . Similarly, the left half of the body sends sensory signals to the right hemisphere such that, for example, sounds in the left ear mainly reach the right cortex."
"However, the two halves of the brain do not work in isolation - for the left and right cerebral cortex are connected by a large fibre tract called the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is required for voluntary actions, language, speech and higher functions such as thinking and remembering. Many of these functions are carried out by both sides of the brain, but some are largely lateralised to one cerebral hemisphere or the other."
"Areas concerned with some of these higher functions, such as speech , have been identified. However there is much still to be learned, particularly about such fascinating issues as consciousness, and so the study of the functions of the cerebral cortex is one of the most exciting and active areas of research in Neuroscience. Whether neurons are sensory or motor, big or small, they all have in common that their activity is both electrical and chemical."
"Neurons both cooperate and compete with each other in regulating the overall state of the nervous system, rather in the same way that individuals in a society cooperate and compete in decision-making processes. Chemical signals received in the dendrites from the axons that contact them are transformed into electrical signals, which add to or subtract from electrical signals from all the other synapses, thus making a decision about whether to pass on the signal elsewhere. Electrical potentials then travel down axons to synapses on the dendrites of the next neuron and the process repeats."
"As we described in the last chapter, a neuron consists of dendrites, a cell body, an axon and synaptic terminals. This structure reflects its functional subdivision into receiving, integrating and transmitting compartments. Roughly speaking, the dendrite receives, the cell-body integrates and the axons transmit - a concept called polarization because the information they process supposedly goes in only one direction."
"Like any structure, it has to hold together. The outer membranes of neurons, made of fatty substances, are draped around a cytoskeleton that is built up of rods of tubular and filamentous proteins that extend out into dendrites and axons alike. The structure is a bit like a canvas stretched over the tubular skeleton of a frame tent."
"The different parts of a neuron are in constant motion, a process of rearrangement that reflects its own activity and that of its neighbours. The dendrites change shape, sprouting new connections and withdrawing others, and the axons grow new endings as the neuron struggles to talk a bit more loudly, or a bit more softly, to others. Inside neurons are many inner compartments."
"These consist of proteins, mostly manufactured in the cell body, that are transported along the cytoskeleton. Tiny protuberances that stick out from the dendrites called dendritic spines. These are where incoming axons make most of their connections."
"Proteins transported to the spines are important for creating and maintaining neuronal connectivity. These proteins are constantly turning over, being replaced by new ones when they’ve done their job. All this activity needs fuel and there are energy factories  inside the cell that keep it all working."
The end-points of the axons also respond to molecules called growth factors. These factors are taken up inside and then transported to the cell body where they influence the expression of neuronal genes and hence the manufacture of new proteins. These enable the neuron to grow longer dendrites or make yet other dynamic changes to its shape or function.
"Information, nutrients and messengers flow to and from the cell body all the time. cerebral cortex are located on the dendritic spines that stick out like little microphones searching for faint signals. Communication between nerve cells at these contact points is referred to as synaptic transmission and it involves a chemical process that we will describe in the next Chapter."
"When the dendrite receives one of the chemical messengers that has been fired across the gap separating it from the sending axon, miniature electrical currents are set up inside the receiving dendritic spine. These are usually currents that come into the cell, called excitation, or they may be currents that move out of the cell, called inhibition. All these positive and negative waves of current are accumulated in the dendrites and they spread down to the cell body."
"If they don’t add up to very much activity, the currents soon die down and nothing further happens. However, if the currents add up to a value that crosses a threshold, the neuron will send a message on to other neurons. So a neuron is kind of miniature calculator - constantly adding and subtracting."
"What it adds and subtracts are the messages it receives from other neurons. Some synapses produce excitation, others inhibition. How these signals constitute the basis of sensation, thought and movement depends very much on the network in which the neurons are embedded."
"The action-potential To communicate from one neuron to another, the neuronal signal has first to travel along the axon. How do neurons do this? The answer hinges on harnessing energy locked in physical and chemical gradients, and coupling together these forces in an efficient way."
"The axons of neurons transmit electrical pulses called action potentials. These travel along nerve fibres rather like a wave travelling down a skipping rope. This works because the axonal membrane contains ionchannels, that can open and close to let through electrically charged ions."
"Some channels let through sodium ions , while others let through potassium ions . When channels open, the Na+ or K+ ions flow down opposing chemical and electrical gradients, in and out of the cell, in response to electrical depolarisation of the membrane. When an action potential starts at the cell body, the first channels to open are Na+ channels."
"A pulse of sodium ions flashes into the cell and a new equilibrium is established within a millisecond. In a trice, the transmembrane voltage switches by about 100 mV. It flips from an inside membrane voltage that is negative  to one that is positive ."
"This switch opens K+ channels, triggering a pulse of potassium ions to flow out of the cell, almost as rapidly as the Na+ ions that flowed inwards, and this in turn causes the membrane potential to swing back again to its original negative value on the inside. The actionpotential is over within less time than it takes to flick a domestic light switch on and immediately off again. Remarkably few ions traverse the cell membrane to do this, and the concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions within the cytoplasm do not change significantly during an action potential."
"However, in the long run, these ions are kept in balance by ion pumps whose job is to bale out excess sodium ions. This happens in much the same way that a small leak in the hull of a sailing boat can be coped with by baling out water with a bucket, without impairing the overall ability of the hull to withstand the pressure of the water upon which the boat floats. The action potential is an electrical event, albeit a complex one."
"Nerve fibres behave like electrical conductors , and so an action potential generated at one point creates another gradient of voltage between the active and resting membranes adjacent to it. In this way, the action potential is actively propelled in a wave of depolarisation that spreads from one end of the nerve fibre to the other. An analogy that might help you think about the conduction of action potentials is the movement of energy along a firework sparkler after it is lit at one end."
"The first ignition triggers very rapid local sparks of activity , but the overall progression of the sparkling wave spreads much more slowly. The marvellous feature of nerve fibres is that after a very brief period of silence  the spent membrane recovers its explosive capability, readying the axon membrane for the next action potential. Much of this has been known for 50 years based on wonderful experiments conducted using the very large neurons and their axons that exist in certain sea-creatures."
"The large size of these axons enabled scientists to place tiny electrodes inside to measure the changing electrical voltages. Nowadays, a modern electrical recording technique called patch-clamping is enabling neuroscientists to study the movement of ions through individual ion-channels in all sorts of neurons, and so make very accurate measurements of these currents in brains much more like our own. In many axons, action-potentials move along reasonably well, but not very fast."
"In others, action potentials really do skip along the nerve. This happens because long stretches of the axon are wrapped around with a fatty, insulating blanket, made out of the stretched out glial cell membranes, called a myelin sheath. New research is telling us about the proteins that make up this myelin sheath."
"This blanket prevents the ionic currents from leaking out in the wrong place but, every so often the glial cells helpfully leave a little gap. Here the axon concentrates its Na+ and K+ ion channels. These clusters of ion channels function as amplifiers that boost and maintain the action potential as it literally skips along the nerve."
"This can be very fast. In fact, in myelinated neurons, action-potentials can race along at 100 metres per second! Action potentials have the distinctive characteristic of being all-or-nothing: they don’t vary in size, only in how often they occur. Thus, the only way that the strength or duration of a stimulus can be encoded in a single cell is by variation of the frequency of action potentials."
The most efficient axons can conduct action potentials at frequencies up to 1000 times per second. Neurotransmitters are stored in tiny spherical bags called synaptic vesicles in the endings of axons. There are vesicles for storage and vesicles closer to nerve endings that are ready to be released.
"The arrival of an action potential leads to the opening of ion-channels that let in calcium . This activates enzymes that act on a range of presynaptic proteins given exotic names like “snare”, “tagmin” and “brevin” - really good names for the characters of a recent scientific adventure story. Neuroscientists have only just discovered that these presynaptic proteins race around tagging and trapping others, causing the releasable synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane, burst open, and release the chemical messenger out of the nerve ending."
"This messenger then diffuses across the 20 nanometre gap called the synaptic cleft. Synaptic vesicles reform when their membranes are swallowed back up into the nerve ending where they become refilled with neurotransmitter, for subsequent regurgitation in a continuous recycling process. Once it gets to the other side, which happens amazingly quickly – in less than a millisecond - it interacts with specialised molecular structures, called receptors, in the membrane of the next neuron."
"Glial cells are also lurking all around the synaptic cleft. Some of these have miniature vacuum cleaners at the ready, called transporters, whose job is to suck up the transmitter in the cleft. This clears the chemical messengers out of the way before the next action potential comes."
But nothing is wasted - these glial cells then process the transmitter and send it back to be stored in the storage vesicles of the nerve endings for future use. Glial-cell housekeeping is not the only means by which neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapse. Sometimes the nerve cells pump the transmitter molecules back directly into their nerve endings.
"In other cases, the transmitter is broken down by other chemicals in the synaptic cleft. The interaction of neurotransmitters with receptors resembles that of a lock and key. The attachment of the transmitter  to the receptors  generally causes the opening of an ion channel; these receptors are called ionotropic receptors ."
"If the ion channel allows positive ions  to enter, the inflow of positive current leads to excitation. This produces a swing in the membrane potential called an excitatory post-synaptic potential . Typically, a large number of synapses converge on a neuron and, at any one moment, some are active and some are not."
"If the sum of these epsps reaches the threshold for firing an impulse, a new action potential is set up and signals are passed down the axon of the receiving neuron, as explained in the previous chapter. The main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is glutamate. The great precision of nervous activity requires that excitation of some neurons is accompanied by suppression of activity in other neurons."
"This is brought about by inhibition. At inhibitory synapses, activation of receptors leads to the opening of ion channels that allow the inflow of negatively charged ions giving rise to a change in membrane potential called an inhibitory post-synaptic potential  . This opposes membrane depolarisation and therefore the initiation of an action potential at the cell body of the receiving neuron."
There are two inhibitory neurotransmitters – GABA and glycine. Synaptic transmission is a very rapid process: the time taken from the arrival of an action potential at a synapse to the generation of an epsp in the next neuron is very rapid - 1/1000 of a second. Different neurons have to time their delivery of glutamate on to others within a short window of opportunity if the epsps in the receiving neuron are going to add up to trigger a new impulse; and inhibition also has to operate within the same interval to be effective in shutting things down.
"The hunt for the identity of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters also revealed the existence of a large number of other chemical agents released from neurons. Many of these affect neuronal mechanisms by interacting with a very different set of proteins in the membranes of neurons called metabotropic receptors. These receptors don’t contain ion channels, are not always localised in the region of the synapse and, most importantly, do not lead to the initiation of action potentials."
"We now think of these receptors as adjusting or modulating the vast array of chemical processes going on inside neurons, and thus the action of metabotropic receptors is called neuromodulation. Metabotropic receptors are usually found in complex particles linking the outside of the cell to enzymes inside the cell that affect cell metabolism. When a neurotransmitter is recognised and bound by a metabotropic receptor, bridging molecules called G-proteins, and other membrane-bound enzymes are collectively triggered."
"Binding of the transmitter to a metabotropic recognition site can be compared to an ignition key. It doesn’t open a door for ions in the membrane, as ionotropic receptors do, but instead kick-starts intracellular second messengers into action, engaging a sequence of biochemical events . The metabolic engine of the neuron then revs up and gets going."
"The effects of neuromodulation include changes in ion channels, receptors, transporters and even the expression of genes. These changes are slower in onset and more long-lasting than those triggered by the excitatory and inhibitory transmitters and their effects extend well beyond the synapse. Although they do not initiate action potentials, they have profound effects on the impulse traffic through neural networks."
"Among the many messengers acting on G-protein coupled receptors are acetylcholine, dopamine and noradrenaline. Neurons that release these transmitters not only have a diverse effect on cells, but their anatomical organisation is also remarkable because they are relatively few in number but their axons project widely through the brain . There are only 1600 noradrenaline neurons in the human brain, but they send axons to all parts of the brain and spinal cord."
"These neuromodulatory transmitters do not send out precise sensory information, but fine-tune dispersed neuronal assemblies to optimise their performance. Noradrenaline is released in response to various forms of novelty and stress and helps to organise the complex response of the individual to these challenges. Lots of networks may need to “know” that the organism is under stress."
"Dopamine makes certain situations rewarding for the animal, by acting on brain centres associated with positive emotional features . Acetylcholine, by contrast, likes to have it both ways. It acts on both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors."
"The first neurotransmitter to be discovered, it uses ionic mechanisms to signal across the neuromuscular junction from motor neurons to striated muscle fibres. It can also function as a neuromodulator. It does this, for example, when you want to focus attention on something - fine-tuning neurons in the brain to the task of taking in only relevant information."
Many people seem to have a constant desire to alter their state of consciousness using drugs. They use stimulant drugs to help them stay awake and dance the night away. Others use sedatives to calm their nerves.
"Or even substances that enable them to experience new forms of consciousness and to forget the troubles of everyday life. All of these drugs interact in different ways with neurotransmitter and other chemical messenger systems in the brain. In many cases, the drugs hijack natural brain systems that have to do with pleasure and reward - psychological processes that are important in eating, drinking, sex and even learning and memory."
"Drugs that act on the brain or the blood supply of the brain can be invaluable - such as those that relieve pain. Recreational drug use has a very different purpose, and the problem with it is that it can lead to abuse. The user can, all too easily, become dependent or even addicted."
"He or she will then suffer very unpleasant physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms when they interrupt their drug habit. This state of dependence can lead a user to crave the drug, even though doing so is clearly damaging to their work, health and family. In extreme cases the user may be drawn into crime in order to pay for the drug."
"Fortunately not everyone who takes a recreational drug becomes dependent on it. Drugs differ in their dependence liability - ranging from high risk in the case of cocaine, heroin and nicotine to lower risk in the case of alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines. During the development of drug dependence the body and brain slowly adapt to the repeated presence of the drug, but exactly what changes go on in the brain remain mysteries."
"Although the primary sites of action of heroin, amphetamines, nicotine, cocaine and cannabis are all different, these drugs share an ability to promote the release of the chemical messenger dopamine in certain brain regions. Although this is not necessarily akin to triggering a “pleasure” mechanism, it is thought that the drug-induced release of dopamine may be an important final common pathway of “pleasure” in the brain. It represents the signal that prompts a person to carry on taking the drug."
"Alcohol acts on neurotransmitter systems in the brain to dampen down excitatory messages and promote inhibition of neural activity. Alcohol’s action proceeds through stages of relaxation and good humour, after one drink, through to sleepiness and loss of consciousness. That is why the police are so strict about drinking and driving, and why there is so much public support for this strict attitude."
"Some people become very aggressive and even violent when they drink, and about one in ten of regular drinkers will become dependent alcoholics. Long-term alcohol use damages the body, especially the liver, and can cause permanent damage to the brain. Pregnant mothers who drink run the risk of having babies with damaged brains and low IQ’s."
"More than 30,000 people die every year in Britain from alcohol-related diseases. Nicotine is the active ingredient in all tobacco products. Nicotine acts on brain receptors that normally recognise the neurotransmitter acetylcholine; it tends to activate natural alerting mechanisms in the brain."
"Given this, it’s not surprising that smokers say that cigarettes help them concentrate and have a soothing effect. The trouble is that nicotine is highly addictive and many inveterate smokers continue to smoke for no better reason than to avoid the unpleasant signs of withdrawal if they stop. The pleasure has long gone."
"While there appears to be no deleterious effect on the brain, tobacco smoke is extremely damaging to the lungs and long-term exposure can lead to lung cancer and also to other lung and heart diseases. More than 100,000 people die every year in Britain from smokingrelated diseases. Cannabis presents us with a puzzle, for it acts on an important natural system in the brain that uses neurotransmitters that are chemically very like cannabis."
"This system has to do with the control of muscles and regulating pain sensitivity. Used wisely, and in a medical context, cannabis can be a very useful drug. Cannabis is an intoxicant which can be pleasurable and relaxing, and it can cause a dream-like state in which one’s perception of sounds, colours and time is subtly altered."
"No-one seems to have died from an overdose, although some users may experience unpleasant panic attacks after large doses. Cannabis has been used at least once by nearly half the population of Britain under the age of 30. Some people believe it should be legalised - and doing so could cut the link between supply of the drug and that of other much more dangerous drugs."
"Unfortunately, as with nicotine, smoking is the most effective way of delivering it to the body. Cannabis smoke contains much the same mixture of poisons as cigerettes . Cannabis smokers tend to develop lung diseases and they run the risk of developing lung cancer - although this has not yet been proved."
"About one in ten users may become dependent, which people who sell the drug are well aware of. Repeated heavy use is incompatible with the skill of driving and with intellectually demanding work; experiments have established that people intoxicated with cannabis are unable to carry out complex mental tasks. Although not yet proven, there is some evidence that heavy use by young people might trigger the mental illness schizophrenia  in susceptible individuals."
"Amphetamines are man-made chemicals that include “Dexedrine”, “Speed”, and the methamphetamine derivative called “Ecstasy”. These drugs act in the brain by causing the release two naturally occurring neurotransmitters. One is dopamine - which probably explains the strong arousal and pleasurable effects of amphetamines."
"The other is serotonin - which is thought to account for their ability to cause a sense of well-being and a dream-like state that can include hallucinations. Dexedrine and Speed promote mainly dopamine release, Ecstasy more serotonin. The even more powerful hallucinogen d-LSD also acts on serotonin mechanisms in the brain."
"Amphetamines are powerful psychostimulants and they can be dangerous - especially in overdose. Animal experiments have shown that Ecstasy can cause a prolonged, perhaps permanent reduction of serotonin cells. This might account for the “mid-week blues” suffered by weekend ecstasy users."
"Every year, dozens of young people die after taking it. Frightening schizophrenialike psychosis can happen after Dexedrine and Speed. You might be lured into thinking that Speed could help you in an exam - but don’t."
"It won’t. Heroin is a man-made chemical derivative of the plant product morphine. Like cannabis, heroin hijacks a system in the brain that employs naturally occurring neurotransmitters known as endorphins."
"These are important in pain control - and so drugs that copy their actions are very valuable in medicine. Heroin is injected or smoked whereupon it causes an immediate pleasurable sensation - possibly due to an effect of endorphins on reward mechanisms. It is highly addictive, but, as dependence develops, these pleasurable sensations quickly subside to be replaced by an incessant “craving”."
It is a very dangerous drug that can kill in even modest overdose . Heroin has ruined many people’s lives. Cocaine is another plant-derived chemical which can cause intensely pleasurable sensations as well as acting as a powerful psychostimulant.
"Like the amphetamines, cocaine makes more dopamine and serotonin available in the brain. However, like heroin, cocaine is a very dangerous drug. People intoxicated with it, especially the smoked form called “crack”, can readily become violent and aggressive, and there is a lifethreatening risk of overdose."
"The dependence liability is high, and the costs of maintaining a cocaine habit draw many users into crime. Touch is special - a handshake, a kiss, a baptism. It provides our first contact with the world."
"Arrays of receptors throughout our bodies are tuned to different aspects of the somatosensory world – touch, temperature and body position - with yet others for the sensations of pain. The power of discrimination varies across the body surface, being exquisitely sensitive at places such as the tips of our fingers. Active exploration is important as well, pointing to important interactions with the motor system."
"Pain serves to inform and to warn us of damage to our bodies. It has a strong emotional impact, and is subject to powerful controls within the body and brain. mbedded in the dermal layers of the skin, beneath the surface, are several types of tiny receptors."
"Named after the scientists who first identified them in the microscope, Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles, Merkel’s disks and Ruffini endings sense different aspects of touch. All these receptors have ion channels that open in response to mechanical deformation, triggering action potentials that can be recorded experimentally by fine electrodes. Some amazing experiments were conducted some years ago by scientists who experimented on themselves, by inserting electrodes into their own skin to record from single sensory nerves."
"From these and similar experiments in anaesthetised animals, we now know that the first two types of receptor adapt quickly and so respond best to rapidly changing indentations , Merkel’s disk responds well to a sustained indentation of the skin , while Ruffini endings respond to slowly changing indentations. An important concept about somatosensory receptors is that of the receptive field. This is the area of skin over which each individual receptor responds."
"Pacinian corpuscles have much larger receptive fields than Meissner’s corpuscles. Together, these and the other receptors ensure that you can feel things over your entire body surface. Once they detect a stimulus, the receptors in turn send impulses along the sensory nerves that enter the dorsal roots of the spinal cord."
"The axons connecting touch receptors to the spinal cord are large myelinated fibres that convey information from the periphery towards the cerebral cortex extremely rapidly. Cold, warmth and pain are detected by thin axons with “naked” endings, which transmit more slowly. Temperature receptors also show adaptation ."
"There are relay stations for touch in the medulla and the thalamus, before projection on to the primary sensory area in the cortex called the somatosensory cortex. The nerves cross the midline so that the right side of the body is represented in the left hemisphere and the left in the right. The input from the body is systematically “mapped” across the somatosensory cortex to form a representation of the body surface."
"Some parts of the body, such as the tips of your fingers and mouth, have a high density of receptors and a correspondingly higher number of sensory nerves. Areas such as our back have far fewer receptors and nerves. However, in the somatosensory cortex, the packing density of neurons is uniform."
"Consequently, the ‘map’ of the body surface in the cortex is very distorted. Sometimes called the sensory homunculus, this would be a curiously distorted person if it actually existed with its complement of touch receptors spread at a uniform density across the body surface. You can test this differential sensitivity across the body with the two-point discrimination test."
"Bend some paper clips into a U-shape, some with the tips 2-3 cm apart, others much closer. Then, with a blindfold on, get a friend to touch various parts of your body with the tips of the paper clips. Do you feel one tip or two?"
Do you sometimes feel one tip when you are actually being touched by two? Why? The ability to perceive fine detail varies greatly across different parts of the body and is most highly developed in the tips of the fingers and lips.
Skin is sensitive enough to measure a raised dot that is less than 1/100th of a millimetre high – provided you stroke it as in a blind person reading Braille. One active area of research asks how the different types of receptor contribute to different tasks such as discriminating between textures or identifying the shape of an object. Touch is not just a passive sense that responds only to what it receives.
It is also involved in the active control of movement. Neurons in the motor cortex controlling the muscles in your arm that move your fingers get sensory input from touch receptors in the finger tips. How better to detect an object that is starting to slip out of your hand than via rapid communication between the sensory and motor systems?
"Cross-talk between sensory and motor systems begins at the first relays in the spinal cord, including proprioceptive feedback on to motor neurons, and it continues at all levels of the somatosensory system. The primary sensory and motor cortices are right beside each other in the brain. Active exploration is crucial for the sense of touch."
"Imagine that you are discriminating fine differences in texture, such as between different fabrics or grades of sandpaper. Which of the following conditions do you think generates the finest discriminations: • Placing your finger-tips on the samples? • Running your finger-tips over the samples?"
• Having a machine run the samples over your finger-tips? The outcome of such behavioural experiments leads to questions about where in the brain the relevant sensory information is analysed. Functional brain imaging suggests that the identification of textures or of objects by touch involves different regions of cortex.
"Brain imaging is also starting to produce insights about cortical plasticity by revealing that the map of the body in the somatosensory area can vary with experience. For example, blind Braille readers have an increased cortical representation for the index finger used in reading, and string players an enlarged cortical representation of the fingers of the left hand. Although often classed with touch as another skin sense, pain is actually a system with very different functions and a very different anatomical organisation."
"Its main attributes are that it is unpleasant, that it varies greatly between individuals and, surprisingly, that the information conveyed by pain receptors provides little information about the nature of the stimulus . The ancient Greeks regarded pain as an emotion not a sensation. Recording from single sensory fibres in animals reveals responses to stimuli that cause or merely threaten tissue damage - intense mechanical stimuli , intense heat, and a variety of chemical stimuli."
"But such experiments tell us nothing directly about subjective experience. Molecular biological techniques have now revealed the structure and characteristics of a number of nociceptors. They include receptors that respond to heat above 460 C, to tissue acidity and - again a surprise - to the active ingredient of chilli peppers."
"The genes for receptors responding to intense mechanical stimulation have not yet been identified, but they must be there. Two classes of peripheral afferent fibres respond to noxious stimuli: relatively fast myelinated fibres, called Αδ fibres, and very fine, slow, non-myelinated C fibres. Both sets of nerves enter the spinal cord, where they synapse with a series of neurons that project up to the cerebral cortex."
"They do so through parallel ascending pathways, one dealing with the localisation of pain , the other responsible for the emotional aspect of pain. This second pathway projects to quite different areas than the somatosensory cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex. In brain-imaging experiments using hyponosis, it has been possible to separate mere pain sensation from the ‘unpleasantness’ of pain."
"Subjects immersed their hands in painfully hot water and were then subjected to hypnotic suggestion of increased or decreased pain intensity or pain unpleasantness. Using positron emission tomography , it was found that during changes in experienced pain intensity there was activation of the somatosensory cortex, whereas the experience of pain unpleasantness was accompanied by activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Given our desire to avoid sources of pain, such as the dentist, you might imagine that a life without pain would be good."
"Not so. For one of the key functions of pain is to enable us to learn to avoid situations that give rise to pain. Action potentials in the nociceptive nerves entering the spinal cord initiate automatic protective reflexes, such as the withdrawal reflex."
"They also provide the very information that guides learning to avoid dangerous or threatening situations. Another key function of pain is the inhibition of activity - the rest that allows healing to occur after tissue damage. Of course, in some situations, it is important that activity and escape reactions are not inhibited."
"To help cope in these situations, physiological mechanisms have evolved that can either suppress or enhance pain. The first such modulatory mechanism to be discovered was the release of endogenous analgesics. Under conditions of likely injury, such as soldiers in battle, pain sensation is suppressed to a surprising degree – presumably because these substances are released."
Animal experiments have revealed that electrical stimulation of brain areas such as the aqueductal gray matter causes a marked elevation in the pain threshold and that this is mediated by a descending pathway from the midbrain to the spinal cord. A number of chemical transmitters are involved including endogenous opioids such as met-enkaphalin. The pain-killer morphine acts on the same receptors at which some of the endogenous opioids act.
"The converse phenomenon of enhanced pain is called hyperalgesia. There is a lowering of the pain threshold, an increase in the intensity of pain, and sometimes both a broadening of the area over which pain is felt or even pain in the absence of noxious stimulation. This can be a major clinical problem."
Hyperalgesia involves sensitisation of the peripheral receptors as well as complex phenomena at various levels of the ascending pain pathways. These include the interaction of chemically mediated excitation and inhibition. The hyperalgesia observed in chronic pain states results from the enhancement of excitation and depression of inhibition.
"Much of this is due to changes in the responsiveness of the neurons that process sensory information. Important changes occur in the receptor molecules that mediate the action of the relevant neurotransmitters. In spite of the great advances in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of hyperalgesia, the clinical treatment of chronic pain is still sadly inadequate."
"Humans are highly visual animals constantly using their eyes to make decisions about the world. With forward facing eyes like other primates, we use vision to sense those many aspects of the environment that are remote from our bodies. Light is a form of electromagnetic energy that enters our eyes where it acts on photoreceptors in the retina."
"This triggers processes by which neural impulses are generated and then travel through the pathways and networks of the visual brain. Separate pathways to the midbrain and the cerebral cortex mediate different visual functions - detecting and representing motion, shape, colour and other distinctive features of the visual world. Some but not all are accessible to consciousness."
"In the cortex, neurons in a large number of distinctive visual areas are specialised for making different kinds of visual decisions. Light enters the eye through the pupil and is focused, by the cornea and the lens, on to the retina at the back of the eye. The pupil is surrounded by a pigmented iris that can expand or copntract, making the pupil larger or smaller as light levels vary."
"It is natural to suppose that the eye acts like a camera, forming an ‘image’ of the world, but this is a misleading metaphor in several respects. First, there is never a static image because the eyes are always moving. Second, even if an image on the retina were to send an image into the brain, “seeing” this next image would then need another person to look at it - a person inside the brain! To avoid an infinite regression, with nothing really explained along the way, we confront the really big problem that the visual brain has to solve - how it uses coded messages from the eyes to interpret and make decisions about the visual world."
"Once focused on the retina, the 125 million photoreceptors arranged across the surface of the retina respond to the light that hits them by generating tiny electrical potentials. These signals pass, via synapes through a network of cells in the retina, in turn activating retinal ganglion cells whose axons collect together to form the optic nerve. These enter the brain where they transmit action potentials to different visual regions with distinct functions."
"Much has been learned about this earliest stage of visual processing. The most numerous photoreceptors, called rods, are about 1000 times more sensitive to light than the other, less numerous category called cones. Roughly speaking, you see at night with your rods but by day with your cones."
"There are three types of cones, sensitive to different wavelengths of light. It is oversimplification to say it is the cones simply produce colour vision - but they are vital for it. If overexposed to one colour of light, the pigments in the cones adapt and then make a lesser contribution to our perception of colour for a short while thereafter ."
"Over the past 25 years, important discoveries have been made about the process of phototransduction , the genetic basis of colour blindness which is due to the absence of certain visual pigments, the function of the retinal network and the presence of two different types of ganglion cells. About 90% of these cells are very small, while another 5% are large M-type or magnocellular cells. We shall see later that abnormalities in the M-Type cells may underlie certain cases of dyslexia ."
"The optic nerve of each eye projects to the brain. The fibres of each nerve meet at a structure called the optic chiasm; half of them “cross” to the other side where they join the other half from the other optic nerve that have stayed “uncrossed”. Together these bundles of fibres form the optic tracts, now containing fibres from both eyes, which now project  to the cerebral cortex."
"It is here that internal “representations” of visual space around us are created. In a similar way to touch , the left-hand side of the visual world is in the right-hemisphere and the right-hand side in the left-hemisphere. This neural representation has inputs from each eye and so the cells in the visual areas at the back of the brain  can fire in response to an image in either eye."
"This is called binocularity. The visual cortex consists of a number of areas, dealing with the various aspects of the visual world such as shape, colour, movement, distance etc. These cells are arranged in columns."
"An important concept about visually responsive cells is that of the receptive field - the region of retina over which the cell will respond to the prefered kind of image. In V1, the first stage of cortical processing, the neurons respond best to lines or edges in a particular orientation. An important discovery was that all the neurons in any one column of cells fire to lines or edges of the same orientation, and the neighbouring column of cells fires best to a slightly different orientation, and so on across the surface of V1."
"This means cortical visual cells have an intrinsic organisation for interpreting the world, but it is not an organisation that is immutable. The extent to which an individual cell can be driven by activity in the left or right eye is modified by experience. As with all sensory systems the visual cortex displays what we call plasticity."
"The intricate circuitry of the visual cortex is one of the great puzzles that has preoccupied neuroscientists. Different types of neurons are arranged across the six cortical layers, connected together in very precise local circuits that we are only now starting to understand. Some of their connections are excitatory and some inhibitory."
"Certain neuroscientists have suggested there is a canonical cortical microcircuit - like chips in a computer. Not everyone agrees. We now think the circuitry in one visual area has many similarities to that in another, but there could be subtle differences that reflect the different ways in which each bit of the visual brain interprets different aspects of the visual world."
Study of visual illusions has also given us insight into the kind of processing that may be going on at different stages of visual analysis. A key function of the cerebral cortex is its ability to form and act upon sensory information received from many sources. Decision making is a critical part of this capability.
"This is the thinking, knowledge-based, or “cognitive” part of the process. Available sensory evidence must be weighed up and choices made  on the best evidence that can be obtained at that time. Some decisions are complex and require extended thinking while others can be simple and automatic."
"Even the simplest decisions involve an interplay between sensory input and existing knowledge. One way to try to understand the neural basis of decisionmaking would be to let an individual go about their normal daily activity and record the activity of neurons as they do various things. We might imagine being able to record, with millisecond precision, the activity of every single one of the 1011 neurons of the brain."
"We would then have not only a lot of data, but also a formidable task in processing it all. We would have an even greater problem in interpreting it. To understand why, think for a moment about the different reasons why people do things."
"A person we see walking to a railway station may be going there to catch a train, to meet someone off a train, or even to go “train-spotting”. Without knowing what their intentions are, it might prove very difficult to interpret the correlations between any patterns of activation in their brain and their behaviour. Experimental neuroscientists like, therefore, to bring behavioural situations under precise experimental control."
"This can be achieved by setting a specific task, ensuring that the human subjects are doing it to the best of their ability after extensive practice, and then monitoring their performance. The best kind of task is one that is sufficiently complex to be interesting, yet sufficiently simple to offer a chance of being able to analyse what is going on. A good example is the process of making a visual decision about the appearance of stimuli - often no more than two stimuli - with the response being a simple choice ."
"Although such a task is simple, it does incorporate a complete cycle of decision-making. Sensory information is acquired and analysed; there are correct and incorrect answers for the decision made; and rewards can be assigned according to whether performance was correct or not. This sort of research is a kind of “physics of vision”."
"A subject of great current interest is how neurons are involved in making decisions about visual motion. Whether or not an object is moving, and in which direction, are critically important judgements for humans and other animals. Relative movement generally indicates that an object is different from other nearby objects."
"The regions of the visual brain involved in processing motion information can be identified as distinct anatomical regions by examining the patterns of connections between brain areas, by using human brain imaging techniques , and by recording the activity of individual neurons in non-human animals. 16 The tiles of this famous café wall in Bristol  are actually rectangular - but they don’t look it. The tiling arrangement creates an illusion caused by complex excitatory and inhibitory interactions amongst neurons processing lines and edges."
The Kanizsa Triangle  doesn’t really exist - but this doesn’t stop you seeing it! Your visual system “decides” that a white triangle is on top of the other objects in the scene. Just black and white dots? It is at first hard to identify to edges or surfaces of the image.
"But once you know it is a Dalmation dog, the image “pops out”. The visual brain uses internal knowledge to interpret the sensory scene. Can you see if you are blind?"
"Surely not. However, the discovery of multiple visual areas in the brain has shown that some visual abilities occur without conscious awareness. Certain people who have sustained damage to the primary visual cortex  report being unable to see things in their field of view but, when asked to reach for the things they claim they cannot see, they do so with remarkable accuracy."
This curious but fascinating phenomenon is known as “blindsight”. This is probably mediated by parallel connections from the eyes to other parts of the cortex. Being unaware of things one sees is an everyday phenomenon in normal people too.
"If you chat with a passenger whilst driving your car, your conscious awareness may be directed entirely to the conversation - yet you drive effectively, stopping at lights and avoiding obstacles. This ability reflects a kind of functional blindsight. Research Frontiers 17 Neurons in one of these areas, area MT or V5, have been recorded in a monkey, while it makes a simple visual decision about a pattern of moving dots."
"Most of the dots are made to move randomly in different directions but a small fraction of them are moving consistently in a single direction - up, down, left or right. The observer has to judge the overall direction of movement of the pattern. The task can be made very easy by arranging for a large percentage of the dots to be moving consistently in one direction, as opposed to randomly, or harder by decreasing the proportion of dots that move consistently."
"It turns out that activity of cells in V5 accurately reflects the strength of the movement signal. Neurons here respond selectivity to particular directions of movement, increasing their activity systematically and accurately when the proportion of dots moving in their preferred motion direction increases. Amazingly, some individual neurons perform just as well at detecting the movement of dots as is an observer, whether a monkey or a human, at making a behavioural judgement."
Microstimulation of such neurons through the recording electrode can even bias the judgement of relative movement that the monkey is making. This is remarkable given that very large numbers of neurons are sensitive to visual motion and one might have expected decisions to be based on the activity of many neurons rather than just a few. Decisions about colour proceed in a similar way .
"Area V5 does more than just register the motion of visual stimuli, it registers perceived motion. If visual tricks are played such that an area of dots are perceived as moving in one direction or another only by virtue of the motion of surrounding dots, i. e."
"an illusion of movement, the neurons corresponding to the area of the illusion will fire differently to rightwards or leftwards perceived movement. If the movement is completely random, neurons that normally prefer rightwards movement fire slightly more on trials when the observer reports that the random motion signal is moving “rightwards” . The difference between neuronal decisions of “rightwards” or “leftwards” reflects what the observer judges about the appearance of motion, not the absolute nature of the moving stimulus."
"Other examples of visual decision and indecision include reactions to perceptual targets that are genuinely ambiguous, such as the so-called Necker cube . With this type of stimulus the observer is placed in a state of indecision, constantly fluctuating from one interpretation to another. A similar rivalry is experienced if the left eye sees a pattern of vertical lines while the right eye sees a pattern of horizontal lines."
"The resulting percept is termed binocular rivalry, as the observer reports first that the vertical lines dominate, then the horizontal lines and then back again to vertical. Once again, neurons in many different areas of the visual cortex reflect when the observer’s perception switches from horizontal to vertical. Our visual world is an astonishing place."
"Light entering the eyes enables us to appreciate the world around us ranging from the simplest of objects through to works of art that dazzle and beguile us. Millions and millions of neurons are involved, with their duties ranging from the job of a retinal photoreceptor responding to a speck of light through to a neuron in area V5 that decides whether something in the visual world is moving. All of this happens apparently effortlessly within our brains."
"We don’t understand it all, but neuroscientists are making great strides. At the lowest extreme of the motor hierarchy, in the spinal cord, hundreds of specialised nerve cells called motor neurons increase their rate of firing. The axons of these neurons project out to the muscles where they activate contractile muscle fibres."
The terminal branches of the axons of each motor neuron form specialised neuromuscular junctions on to a limited number of muscle fibres within one muscle . Each action potential in a motor neuron causes the release of neurotransmitter from nerve endings and generates a corresponding action potential in the muscle fibres. This causes Ca2+ ions to be released from intracellular stores inside each muscle fibre.
"This in turn triggers contraction of the muscle fibres, producing force and movement. The electrical events in the muscles of the arm can be recorded with an amplifier, even through the skin, and these electro-myographic recordings  can be used to measure the level of activity in each muscle . The spinal cord plays an important part in the control of the muscles through several different reflex pathways."
"Among these are the withdrawal reflexes that protect you from sharp or hot objects, and the stretch reflexes that have a role in posture. The well-known ‘knee-jerk’ reflex is an example of a stretch reflex that is rather special because it involves only two types of nerve cell - sensory neurons that signal muscle length, connected through synapses to motor neurons that cause the movement. These reflexes combine together with more complex ones, in spinal circuits that organise more or less complete behaviours, such as the rhythmic movement of the limbs when walking or running."
"These involve coordinated excitation and inhibition of motor neurons. Motor neurons are the final common path to the muscles that move your bones. However, the brain has a major problem controlling the activity of these cells."
"Which muscles should it move to achieve any particular action, by how much, and in what order? At the opposite end of the motor hierarchy, in the cerebral cortex, a bewildering number of calculations have to be made by many tens of thousands of cells for each element of movement. These calculations ensure that movements are carried out smoothly and skilfully."
"In between the cerebral Movement To make muscles contract, the nerves form specialized contacts with individual muscle fibres at the neuromuscular junction. As they develop, multiple nerve fibres go to each muscle fibre but, due to competition between neurons, all but one is eliminated. The final successful nerve is then left to release its neurotransmitter acetylcholine on to specialised molecular detectors at the “motor endplate” ."
"This image was made using a confocal microscope. Recordings of the electrical activity associated with muscles . 20 cortex and motor neurons of the spinal cord, critical areas in the brain stem combine information about the limbs and muscles ascending from the spinal cord with descending information from the cerebral cortex."
"The motor cortex is a thin strip of tissue running across the surface of the brain, directly in front of the somatosensory cortex . Here is a complete map of the body: nerve cells that cause movements in different limbs  are topographically arranged. By using a recording electrode, neurons may be found in any part of this map that are active about 100 milliseconds before activity in the appropriate muscles."
Quite what is coded in the motor cortex was the subject of a long debate - do the cells in the cortex code for actions that a person wants to perform or for the individual muscles that must be contracted to perform it. The answer to this question turned out to be somewhat different – individual neurons do not code for either. Instead a population code is used in which actions are specified by the firing of an ensemble of neurons.
"Just in front of the motor cortex lie important pre-motor areas that are involved in planning actions, in preparing spinal circuits for movement, and in processes that establish links between seeing movements and understanding gestures. Striking new findings include the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that respond both when the monkey sees a hand movement and when the animal performs that same movement. Mirror neurons are likely to be important in imitating and understanding actions."
"Behind the motor cortex, in the parietal cortex, a number of different cortical areas are concerned with the spatial representation of the body and of visual and auditory targets around us. They seem to hold a map of where our limbs are, and where interesting targets are with respect to us. Damage to these areas, for example after a stroke, can cause misreaching for objects or even neglect or denial of parts of the world around us."
"Patients with so-called parietal neglect fail to notice objects  and some even ignore the left side of their own body. The basal ganglia are a cluster of interconnected areas located beneath the cortex in the depths of the cerebral hemispheres. They are crucial in the initiation of movements, though quite how they do this is far from clear."
"The basal ganglia seem to act rather like a complex filter, selecting information from amongst the enormous numbers of diverse inputs they receive from the anterior half of the cortex . The output of the basal ganglia feeds back to the motor cortical areas. A common human motor disorder, Parkinson’s disease, is characterised by tremor and difficulty in initiating movements."
"It is as if the selective filter in the basal ganglia is blocked. The problem is the degeneration of neurons in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra  whose long, projecting axons release the neurotransmitter dopamine into the basal ganglia . The precise arrangement of the dopamine axons onto their target neurons in the basal ganglia is very intricate, suggesting an important interaction between different neurotransmitters."
"Treatment with the drug L-Dopa, which is converted into dopamine in the brain, restores dopamine levels and restores movement . The basal ganglia are also thought to be important in learning, allowing the selection of actions that lead to rewards. The cerebellum is crucial for skilful smooth movements."
"It is a beautiful neuronal machine whose intricate cellular architecture has been mapped out in great detail. Like the basal ganglia, it is extensively interconnected with the cortical areas concerned with motor control, and also with brainstem structures. Damage to the cerebellum leads to poorly coordinated movements, loss of balance, slurred speech, and also a number of cognitive difficulties."
Sounds familiar? Alcohol has a powerful effect on the cerebellum. The cerebellum is also vital for motor learning and adaptation.
"Almost all voluntary actions rely on fine control of motor circuits, and the cerebellum is important in their optimal adjustment - for example with respect to timing. It has a very regular cortical arrangement and seems to have evolved to bring together vast amounts of information from the sensory systems, the cortical motor areas, the spinal cord and the brainstem. The acquisition of skilled movements depends on a cellular learning mechanism called long-term depression , which reduces the strength of some synaptic connections ."
"There are a number of theories of cerebellar function; many involve the idea that it generates a “model” of how the motor systems work – a kind of virtual reality simulator of your own body, inside your head. It builds this model using the synaptic plasticity that is embedded into its intricate network. So, catch that ball again, and realise that almost all levels of your motor hierarchy are involved - from planning the action in relation to the moving visual target, programming the movements of your limbs, and adjusting the postural reflexes of your arm."
"At all stages, you would need to integrate sensory information into the stream of signals leading to your muscles. The human body and brain develop from a single cell - the fertilized egg. But how?"
"The governing principle of developmental biology is that the genome is a set of instructions for making an organ of the body, not a blueprint. The genome is the 40,000 or so genes that orchestrate the process. Carrying out these instructions is a bit like the Chinese art of paper folding - a limited set such as fold, bend and unfold produces a structure that would take many drawings to describe as a blueprint."
"Beginning with the embryo, a comparatively small set of genetic instructions is able to generate the huge diversity of cells and connections of the brain during development. Amazingly, many of our genes are shared with the fruit fly, Drosophila. Indeed, thanks to studies of the fruit fly, the majority of the genes known to be important in human nervous system development were first identified."
"Neuroscientists studying brain development examine a wide variety of animals - zebrafish, frog, chick and mouse – each having advantages for examining particular molecular or cellular events. The zebrafish embryo is transparent - allowing each cell to be watched under the microscope as it develops. The mouse breeds rapidly - its genome has been mapped and almost completely sequenced."
"Chicks and frogs are less amenable to genetic studies, but their large embryos allow microsurgical manipulations - such as examining what happens when cells are moved to abnormal positions. The first step in brain development is cell division. Another key step is cell differentiation in which individual cells stop dividing and take on specific characteristics - such as those of neurons or glial cells."
Differentiation orders things spatially. Different kinds of neurons migrate to various locations in a process is called pattern formation. The first major event of pattern formation takes place in the third week of human gestation when the embryo is just two connected sheets of dividing cells.
"A small patch of cells on the upper surface of the bilayer is instructed to make the entire brain and spinal cord. These cells form a tennis racketshaped structure called the neural plate, the front of which is destined to form the brain, the rear to be the spinal cord. Signals directing the destiny of these cells come from the layer beneath that goes on to form the midline skeleton and muscles of the embryo."
"Various regions of the early nervous system express different subsets of genes, presaging the emergence of brain areas - forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain - with distinct cellular architecture and function. A week later, the neural plate rolls up, closes into a tube and sinks into the embryo, where it becomes enveloped by the future epidermis. Further profound changes happen in the next few weeks, including changes in cell shape, division and migration, and cell-cell adhesion."
"For example, the neural tube flexes such that the head region is bent at right angles to the trunk region. This patterning progresses to finer and finer levels of resolution, ultimately conferring individual identity on to young neurons. Things can go wrong."
"Failure of the neural tube to close results in spina bifida, a condition that is usually confined to the lower spinal cord. While distressing, it is not lifethreatening. By contrast, failure of closure at the head end can result in the complete absence of an organised brain, a condition known as anencephaly."
"The underlying principle of patterning is that cells get to know their position relative to the principal axes of the nervous system - front to back and top to bottom. In effect, each cell measures its position with respect to these orthogonal coordinates much as a map-reader figures out his or her position by measuring distance from defined points. The way this works at the molecular level is that the embryo sets up a number of localised polarizing regions in the neural tube that secrete signal molecules."
"In each case, the molecule diffuses away from its source to form a gradient of concentration with distance. An example of this position-sensing mechanism is the top to bottom  axis of the spinal cord. The bottom part of the neural tube expresses a secreted protein with a wonderful name - Sonic hedgehog."
"Sonic hedgehog diffuses away from the floor plate and affects cells on the dorsoventral axis according to their distance from the floor plate. When close, Sonic hedgehog induces the expression of a gene that makes a particular type of interneuron. Further away, the now lower concentration of Sonic hedgehog induces expression of another gene making motor neurons."
"Once a neuron acquires its individual identity and stops dividing, it extends its axon with an enlarged tip known as a growth cone. A bit like a nimble mountain guide, the growth cone is specialized for moving through tissue, using its skills to select a favourable path. As it does so, it plays out the axon behind it, rather like a dog on an extending leash."
"Once its target has been reached the growth cone loses its power of movement and forms a synapse. Axonal guidance is a supreme navigational feat, accurate over short and long distances. It is also a very single-minded process for not only is the target cell selected with high precision but, to get there, the growth cone may have to cross over other growth cones heading for different places."
"Along the path, guidance cues that attract  or repel  the growth cones help them find their way, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of these cues remain poorly understood. Although a high degree of precision in both the spatial arrangement of neurons and their connectivity is achieved from the outset, the wiring of some parts of the nervous system is later subject to activity-dependent refinement, such as the pruning of axons and the death of neurons. These losses may appear wasteful, but it is not always possible or desirable to make a complete and perfect brain by construction alone."
"Evolution has been said to be “a tinkerer” - but it is also a sculptor. For example, point-topoint mapping between neurons in the eye and the brain, absolutely required for sharp vision, is achieved in part through the influence patterned electrical activity in the retina. Also, an initial exuberant set of connections is sculpted during a critical period, after which the basic pattern of the visual system is complete, at around eight weeks of age in monkeys, perhaps a year in humans."
"An intriguing question is whether such early developmental programs can ever be re-activated in cases of pathological neuronal loss  or of spinal cord damage that results in paralysis. In the latter, axons can be encouraged to re-grow following injury but whether they can be made to re-connect appropriately remains an area of intense investigation. We are rapidly acquiring a complete catalogue of the genes needed to build a brain."
"Thanks to the prodigious power of molecular biological methods, we can test the function of genes by modulating their expression wherever and whenever we want during development. The major task now is to work out the hierarchy of genetic control that converts a sheet of cells into a working brain. It is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience."
"Dyslexia is very common. As children who have it cannot understand why they find reading so difficult when they know they are as intelligent as friends who find it easy, dyslexia is a real cause of misery. Many children lose confidence, and this can lead to a downward spiral of frustration, rebellion, aggression and even delinquency."
"Yet many dyslexics go on to display great talents in other spheres - sport, science, computing, commerce or the arts – provided their early problems with reading have not caused them to lose all hope and self- esteem. Hence understanding the biological basis of dyslexia is not only important in itself, but also a contribution to preventing a burden of misery. Understanding the process of reading better may lead us to a way of overcoming or treating the problem."
"Reading depends on being able to recognise alphabetic visual symbols in their right order - the orthography of whatever language a child is learning - and to hear the separate sounds in words in their right order. This involves extracting what is called the phonemic structure, so that the symbols can be translated into the correct sounds. Unfortunately most dyslexics are slow and inaccurate at analysing both the orthographic and phonological features of words."
"The ability to sequence letters and sounds accurately depends on both visual and auditory mechanisms. For unfamiliar words, and all are unfamiliar to the beginning reader, each letter has to be identified and then to be put in the right order. This process is not as easy as it sounds, because the eyes make small movements flicking from one letter to the next."
The letters are identified during each fixation of the eye but their order is given by where the eye was pointing when each letter was seen. What the eyes see has to be integrated with motor signals from the eye movement system; and it is with this visuomotor integration that many dyslexics have problems. Visual control of the eye movement system is dominated by a network of large neurons known as the magnocellular system.
"It gets this name because the neurons  are very large . This network can be traced right from the retina, through the pathway to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, to the motor neurons of the eye-muscles. It is specialised to respond particularly well to moving stimuli and it is therefore important for tracking moving targets."
"An important feature of this system is that it generates motion signals, during reading, when the eyes move off letters they are meant to be fixating. This motion error signal is fed back to the eye-movement system to bring the eyes back on target. The magnocellular system plays a crucial part in helping to point the eyes steadily at each letter in turn, and hence in determining their order."
"Neuroscientists have found that the visual magnocellular system is mildly impaired in many dyslexics. Looking at brain tissue directly is one way to reveal this  but, in addition, the sensitivity to visual motion of dyslexics is poorer than that of normal readers and their brain wave responses to moving stimuli are abnormal. Brain imaging has also revealed altered patterns of functional activation in regions sensitive to visual motion ."
The control of the eye in dyslexics is less steady; hence they often complain that letters seem to move around and change places when they are trying to read. These visual confusions are probably the result of the visual magnocellular system failing to stabilise their eyes as well as it does in good readers. Many dyslexics also have problems putting the sounds of words in the right order so that they tend to mispronounce words  and they are very bad at tongue twisters.
"When they come to reading, they are slower and more inaccurate at translating letters into the sounds they stand for. Like their visual problems, this phonological deficiency is probably rooted in a mild deficiency of basic auditory skills. We distinguish letter sounds, called phonemes, by detecting the subtle differences in the sound frequency and intensity changes that characterise them."
"Detecting these acoustic modulations is carried out by a system of large auditory neurons that track changes in sound frequency and intensity. There is growing evidence that these neurons fail to develop as well in dyslexics as in good readers and that the categorical boundaries between similar sounds, such as ‘b’ and ‘d’, are harder for them to hear . Many dyslexics show evidence of impaired development of brain cells, extending beyond the visual and auditory problems they have with reading."
"These are problems in neurons that form networks throughout the brain that seem to be specialised for tracking temporal changes. The cells all have the same surface molecules by which they recognise and form contacts with each other, but which may make them vulnerable to antibody attack. The magnocellular system provides a particularly large input to the cerebellum ."
"Interestingly, some dyslexics are remarkably clumsy and their handwriting is often very poor. Neuroimaging  and metabolic studies of the cerebellum have indicated that its function can be impaired in dyslexics and this may be at the root of their difficulties with handwriting. Some neuroscientists believe the cerebellum is involved in much more than the execution of movements such as writing and speaking, even including aspects of cognitive planning."
"If correct, deficits in cerebellar function could add to problems with learning to read, write and spell. There are a number of treatments for dyslexia, each indicated by the different hypotheses about its underlying cause. Sum focus on the magnocellular hypothesis, but other accounts distinguish different forms of the acquired condition, known as surface and deep dyslexia, which may require different kinds of treatment."
All treatments rely on early diagnosis. Scientists do not always agree on things and the best treatment for dyslexia is one such area of disagreement. It has been suggested recently that problems in sound processing result in some dyslexics going down the wrong path for learning about sounds using the brain’s normal mechanisms of plasticity.
"The idea is that children can get back on the ‘straight and narrow’ if they are encouraged to play computer games in which they hear sounds that have been slowed down to the point where phonemic boundaries are much clearer. The sounds are then gradually speeded up. It is claimed that this works very well, but independent tests are still being done."
"What is scientifically interesting about the idea is that perfectly normal brain processes interact with an early genetic abnormality to produce an exaggerated effect. It’s a striking example of how genes and the environment can interact. It is important to stress that dyslexics may be slightly better than even good readers at some perceptual judgements such as colour distinctions and global, rather than local, shape discriminations."
"This hints at a possible explanation of why many dyslexics may be superior in seeing long-range associations, unexpected associations and at ‘holistic’ thinking in general. Remember that Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Christian Andersen, Edison and Einstein and many other creative artists and inventors were dyslexic. As we saw in the last chapter, the connections between neurons early in life require fine-tuning."
"As we interact with our environment, these synaptic connections start to change – with new ones being made, useful connections becoming stronger, and connections that are infrequently used becoming weaker or even lost for good. Synapses that are active and those that are actively changing are kept while the rest are pruned. This is a kind of use it or lose it principle by which we mould the future of our brains."
"Synaptic transmission involves the release of a chemical neurotransmitter that then activates specific protein molecules called receptors. The normal electrical response to neurotransmitter release is a measure of synaptic strength. This can vary and the change may last for a few seconds, a few minutes or even for a lifetime."
"Neuroscientists are particularly interested in long-lasting changes in synaptic strength that can be produced by brief periods of neuronal activity, notably in two processes called long-term potentiation , which enhances their strength, and long-term depression , which depresses them. Glutamate is a common amino acid used throughout our bodies to build proteins. You may have come across it as the flavour enhancer called mono-sodium glutamate."
"It is the neurotransmitter that functions at the most plastic synapses of our brains - those that exhibit LTP and LTD. Glutamate receptors, which are mainly on the receiving side of the synapse, come in four varieties: three are ionotropic receptors and have been given the names AMPA, NMDA and kainate. The fourth type is metabotropic and is called mGluR."
"Although all the types of glutamate receptors respond to the same neurotransmitter, they perform very different functions. The ionotropic glutamate receptors use their ion channels to generate an excitatory post-synaptic potential  while the metabotropic glutamate receptors, like the neuromodulatory actions we described earlier , modulate the size and nature of this response. All types are important for synaptic plasticity, but it is the AMPA and NMDA receptors about which we know the most and that are often thought of as memory molecules."
"Much of this knowledge has come about because of pioneering work developing new drugs that act on these receptors to modify their activity . AMPA receptors are fastest into the act. Once glutamate is bound to these receptors, they rapidly open their ion channels to produce a transient excitatory postsynaptic potential ."
"The glutamate is only bound to AMPA receptors for a fraction of a second and, once it leaves and is removed from the synapse, the ion channels close and the electrical potential reverts to its resting state. This is what happens when neurons in the brain send information to each other quickly. Glutamate also binds to NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic neuron."
"These are the critical molecular machines that trigger synaptic plasticity. If the synapse is activated quite slowly, the NMDA receptors play little or no role. This is because as soon as NMDA receptors open their ion channels these channels become plugged by another ion present in the synapse – magnesium ."
"But, when synapses are activated by several pulses very quickly to a set of inputs on to a neuron, the NMDA receptors immediately sense this excitement. This greater synaptic activity causes a large depolarisation in the postsynaptic neuron and this dispels the Mg2+ from the NMDA ion channels by a process of electrical repulsion. NMDA receptors are then immediately able to partake in the synaptic communication."
"They do this in two ways: first, and just like AMPA receptors, they conduct Na+ and K+ which adds to the depolarisation; second, they allow calcium  to enter the neuron. In other words, NMDA receptors sense strong neuronal activity and send a signal to the neuron in the form of a surge of Ca2+. This Ca2+ surge is also brief, lasting for no more than about a second while glutamate is bound to NMDA receptors."
"However, Ca2+ is a crucial molecule as it also signals to the neuron when NMDA receptors have been activated. Once inside the neuron, the Ca2+ binds to proteins located extremely close to the synapses where the NMDA receptors were activated. Many of these proteins are physically connected to the NMDA receptors in what constitutes a molecular machine."
"Some are enzymes that are activated by Ca2+ and this lead to chemical modifications of other proteins within or close to the synapse. These chemical modifications are the first stages of the formation of the memories. f NMDA receptor activation triggers plastic changes in the connectivity of neurons, what expresses the change in strength?"
"It could be that more chemical transmitter is released. This can occur, but we are fairly certain that one set of mechanisms involves AMPA receptors on the post-synaptic side of the synapse. There are various ways of doing this."
"One way might be to enable AMPA receptors to work more efficiently, such as to pass more current into the neuron upon activation. A second way would be to enable more AMPA receptors to be inserted into the synapse. In both cases this leads to a larger epsp - the phenomenon of LTP."
"The opposite change, a reduction in the efficiency or number of AMPA receptors can result in LTD. The beauty of this mechanism for inducing LTP or LTD is its elegance yet relative simplicity – it can all occur within a single dendritic spine and thereby alter synaptic strength in a highly localised manner. It is the stuff that memories might actually be made of - an issue to which we return in the next chapter."
"Changes in the functioning of AMPA receptors are not the whole story. As memories become more permanent, structural alterations occur in the brain. Synapses with more AMPA receptors inserted following the induction of LTP change their shape and may grow bigger, or new synapses may sprout out from the dendrite so that the job of one synapse can now be done by two."
"Conversely, synapses that lose AMPA receptors following the induction of LTD may wither and die. The physical substance of our brains is altering in response to brain activity. Brains like exercise – mental exercise of course! Just as our muscles grow stronger when we engage in physical exercise, so it now seems that our synaptic connections become more numerous and better organised when we use them a lot."
"How well we learn is greatly influenced by our emotional state - we tend to remember events associated with particularly happy, sad or painful experiences. We also learn better when we pay attention! These states of mind involve the release of neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine , dopamine, noradrenaline and steroid hormones such as cortisol . Modulators have multiple actions on neurons, several of which act via changes in the functioning of NMDA receptors."
Other actions include the activation of special genes specifically associated with learning. The proteins that they make help to stabilise LTP and make it last longer. Synaptic plasticity plays another critical function in our brains – it can help the brain recover from injury.
"For example, if the neurons that control particular movements are destroyed, as happens during a stroke or serious head injury, all is not necessarily lost. Under most circumstances, the neurons themselves do not grow back. Instead other neurons adapt and can sometimes take on similar functional roles to the lost neurons, forming another network that is similar."
It is a process of re-learning and highlights certain recuperative abilities of the brain. There is no single brain area to which all the information we ever learn is shuttled for storage. Working-memory holds information in your mind for a short time in an active conscious state.
"The much larger, more passive storehouse of information is called long-term memory. Like a pad on a desk for jotting down names or telephone numbers that we need to remember only briefly, the brain has a system for holding on to and working with small amounts of information very accurately. We use it to remember speech for long enough to interpret the flow of conversation, for doing mental arithmetic, and for remembering where and when we put our keys down a moment ago."
Fidelity is central to the system - a feature that comes at the cost of limited capacity and persistence. It is often said that you can remember 7 ± 2 items in working memory; this is why so many telephone numbers are no longer than 7 or 8 digits. But remembering these accurately is essential.
"You can demonstrate the capacity and limited persistence of working memory in a simple experiment you can do with your friends. A central executive system controls the flow of information, supported by two additional memory stores. There is a phonological store alongside a silent rehearsal loop - the bit of your brain that you use to say things to yourself."
"Even if you read words or numbers visually, the information will be transcribed into a phonological code and stored for a short while in this two-part system. There is also a visual sketchpad that can hold on to images of objects for long enough for you to manipulate them in your mind’s eye. Working memory is largely located in the frontal and parietal lobes."
"Brain imaging studies  using PET and fMRI brain imaging indicate that the auditory parts of workingLearning & Memory Visuo-Spatial Sketch Pad Central Executive System Auditory Short Term Store Silent Rehearsal Loop Inner Scribe The short-term working-memory system of the brain An Experiment on Short-Term Memory A simple test of short-term or working memory is called “letter-span”. You need a minimum of 2 people, although it works better with the whole class. Privately, one of you writes down a series of letters beginning with as few as 2, taking care they do not spell out a word ."
"This person then produces further letter strings, one letter longer at a time . The experiment begins after these are prepared. The other person  listens to each letter string in turn and, after about 5 seconds, tries to write down the letters in the correct order from memory."
"Starting with the easy 2-letter string, the memory test moves on to longer ones. Most people can do it perfectly up to about 7 or 8 letters - and then errors creep in. Very few can do 10 letters correctly."
"The capacity of short-term memory has been described as “the magical number 7 plus or minus 2”. t MY NAME ADDRESS AGE Shopping List FACE HER calculus memory are generally lateralised to the left frontal and parietal lobes where they interact with neuronal networks involved in speech, planning and decision-making. These are activities for which a good working-memory is essential."
"The visual sketchpad is in the right hemisphere . How did working-memory evolve? Animals, even most mammals, probably do not have quite the same sort of short-term memory system as we have, and it clearly didn’t evolve to help early hominids remember telephone numbers! Studies with young children point to a critical role for workingmemory in learning language, suggesting that this memory system may have co-evolved with speech."
The precision required for keeping track of words and their order in a sentence is critical for accurately working out the correct meaning. Long-term memory is also sub-divided into different systems located in widely dispersed networks of the brain. The different networks do very different jobs.
"Broadly speaking, information enters sensory systems and then passes down pathways that provide increasingly specialised processing. For example, information entering the visual system passes down a so-called ventral pathway from the striate cortex to the medial temporal lobe through a cascade of networks that work out shape, colour, object dentity, whether the object is familiar or not, until finally, some kind of memory is formed of this particular object and when and where it has been seen. There are several ways of thinking about this cascade of analysis."
"First, there are areas in the cortex that extract a perceptual representation of what we are looking at. This is used to store and later recognise things around us. Our ability to identify familiar people in newspaper cartoons, such as politicians, reflects this system."
"Very closely related is a system called semantic memory - the vast storehouse of factual knowledge that we have all accumulated about the world. We know that Paris is the capital of France, that DNA encodes genetic information as a sequence of base pairs, and so on. The critical property is that facts are organised into categories."
"This is vital for memory retrieval as the search process can then shuttle through tree diagrams in this storehouse to find things efficiently. If semantic memory were organised in the way that many people organise things in the attic of their houses - pretty randomly - we would have terrible trouble remembering anything. Fortunately, the brain sorts the information that we encode into categories, though it helps to have a skilled teacher for the complex things we learn at school."
"Indeed, gifted teachers build these structures in their pupils effortlessly. We also learn skills and acquire emotional feelings about things. Knowing that a piano is a piano is one thing: being able to play it is another."
"Knowing how to ride a bicycle is useful, but being aware that certain situations on the road can be dangerous is no less important. Skills are learned through deliberate and extensive practice, whereas emotional learning tends to be much more rapid. Often it has to be fast, particularly for the things we learn to be afraid of."
"Both are types of learning called conditioning. Specialised brain areas are involved - the basal ganglia and cerebellum being very important for skill learning, and the amygdala for emotional learning. Many animals learn skills - it is very important for their survival."
The last type of memory system in the brain is called episodic memory. It is what you use to keep track of personal experience. Remembering events is different from learning facts in one very important respect - events happen only once.
"If you forget what you ate at breakfast today , or what happened last Christmas , or all the things that happened on your very first day at school , you cannot re-run any of these events like an extra lesson in class. This system learns quickly because it has to. We have learned a lot about what episodic memory is by studying neurological patients who, following a stroke, brain tumours or viral infections such as herpes encephalitis, sometimes have very specific deficits in this type of memory."
"Studying such patients carefully has been the major way to work out the anatomical organization of this and other memory systems. People affected by a condition known as amnesia cannot remember meeting other people only half an hour earlier. They cannot remember whether they have recently eaten a meal or ought to have one, and even such simple necessities of life as where things have recently been put down around the house."
"Shown a complex drawing - such as the one in the inset - they can copy it accurately but they cannot draw it as well as most of us could do from memory as little as 30 minutes later. Often, they cannot remember things that happened before they became ill. This is called retrograde amnesia."
"Such a life lacks all structure in time and place and has been described by one extensively studied amnesic patient as like continually “waking from a dream”. Yet this same person retains his command of language and the meaning of words, and enough working-memory to carry on a sensible conversation. It is not until one has exactly the same conversation with him a few minutes later that the devastating isolation of his existence is revealed."
"Amazingly, amnesic patients can learn some things that they cannot consciously remember! They can be taught motor skills or to read backwards very quickly. Training to read backwards quickly takes a while This is true for amnesics no less than for us, but whereas we would remember being taught to do this, they do not. This is a fascinating dissociation in their conscious awareness."
"Amnesics are certainly conscious when they learn, but are later unaware of having learned. They cannot recover conscious awareness from the past. The damage that causes this distressing condition can occur in a number of brain circuits."
"Areas of the midbrain called mamillary bodies and the thalamus seem to be critical for normal memory, as is a structure in the medial temporal lobe called the hippocampus. Damage in these regions seems particularly to affect the formation of episodic and semantic memories. Damage elsewhere in the brain affects other memory systems."
"Degenerative conditions, such as certain types of semantic dementia , can cause fascinating patterns of breakdown of semantic memory. Early on, patients will be quite capable of telling you that the pictures they are being shown in an experiment are of a cat, or a dog, or of a car, or a train. Later on in the disease, they may hesitate to call a picture of a mouse a mouse, saying instead that it is a dog."
"What this confirms is that factual information is organised categorically, with animate information stored together in one place well away from inanimate information. Studying neurological patients carefully helps us to discover where memory functions are in the brain, but finding out how They work in terms of neurons and chemical transmitters involves carefully conducted research using laboratory animals. Neuroscientists now believe that many aspects of the fine-tuning of neural connections in the developing brain are also used during early learning."
"The attachment that develops between an infant and its mother has been studied in young chicks in a process called imprinting. We now know where this learning process takes place in the young chick’s brain and the chemical transmitters that are released to act on receptors involved in storing some kind of an ‘image’ of the mother. This image is quite precise, such that the young chick will follow its mother but not another."
"Young animals also need to know what foods are safe to eat by tasting small amounts of food at a time, and learning those that taste bad. This cannot be left to genetic predispositions alone - developmentally tuned learning mechanisms are at work. Downstream of the receptors activated during imprinting or the tasting of food, a cascade of secondmessenger chemicals transmit signals to the nucleus of brain cells where genes are activated to make special proteins that can literally fix the memory Place cells are another important discovery."
These are neurons in the hippocampus that fire action-potentials only when an animal explores a familiar place. Different cells code for different parts of the environment such that a population of cells is involved in mapping a whole area. Other cells in a nearby brain area code for the direction the animal is moving in.
"The two areas working together - the map of space and the sense of direction - help the animal learn to find its way around the world. This is clearly very important for animals, because finding food and water and then their way back to the burrow, nest, or other home is vital for their survival. This navigational learning system relates to both semantic and episodic memory."
Animals form a stable representation of where things are in their territory - just like the factual knowledge we acquire about our world. And this map of space provides a memory framework in which to remember events - such as where a predator was last seen. Place cells may code more than just place - they may help animals to remember where events have happened.
"How are these maps and other memory traces formed? One emerging view is that synaptic plasticity based on NMDA receptors is involved. In the last chapter, we described how activating synaptic plasticity changes the strength of the connections in a network of neurons and that this is a way of storing information."
"Learning about places is impaired when a drug that blocks NMDA receptors is applied to the hippocampus. For example, rats and mice can be trained to swim in a pool of water to find an escape platform hidden at one place underneath the water surface. They use their place cells and head-direction cells to help find their way, and they encode the correct location of the platform into memory using plasticity triggered by NMDA receptors."
"Also gene knockout animals have been engineered in which NMDA receptors have been deleted in the hippocampus. These animals are also bad at learning and they also have very inaccurate place cells. In the last chapter, we explained that changes in synaptic weights are expressed through alterations in excitatory AMPA receptors."
We still don’t know if that is true of memory - it is a topic of intense research just now. We all think that it would be good to improve the capacity or persistence of our memory. Older people often complain about their memory.
"However, improving memory would almost certainly come at a price. This is because a good memory is a balance between remembering and forgetting. If we were we to improve it, we might then have difficulty forgetting all the trivial things that happened during the day that there is no need to remember."
"The ‘yin and yang’ of a good memory is one that remembers and organises the right things in the brain, but forgets things that seem less important. It seems unlikely that we shall ever have a pill that will act like a magic bullet to improve memory, at least in normal people. Evolution has ensured that the system is optimally balanced."
"Having said that, really serious forgetfulness might be alleviated by drugs that make NMDA or AMPA receptors work better, or drugs to stimulate the cascade of secondmessenger signals that studies of learning in young animals have identified. It would be helpful also to find some way of stemming the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease that affect memory early on. One of the exciting adventures in neuroscience today, for scientists in universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, is working on projects of this kind."
"With the population demography of virtually all developed countries veering towards a greater preponderance of older people, treatments that could help them lead independent lives for longer would be greatly valued. However, some scientists believe that cognitive engineering will be needed alongside drugs. You do not hear so much about cognitive engineering in the newspapers as about new drugs, but it is no less important."
"The idea is to take advantage of what has been learned about how information is encoded, stored, consolidated  and then retrieved. Paying attention, spacing out learning sessions, and getting frequent reminders to help the ‘fixing’ process are all examples. Some elderly patients with memory problems are finding a paging system called “NeuroPage” quite helpful - it reminds them of what they should be doing next and so helps them structure their day in a manner that they might otherwise forget to do."
"Recognising the different operating principles of episodic memory and skill learning is also essential - you will never learn a skill by merely hearing about it, although this works fine for episodic memory. Anyone trying to learn a skill must practice often, as the pupils of any music teacher are always reminded. Stress is tricky to pin down."
"It isn’t just being under pressure - for this is not always stressful - but some kind of mismatch between what the body and brain anticipate and what challenges we actually experience or feel. Many challenges that we face are psychological - reflecting the difficulties of interacting with others as we work towards academic success, compete for a place in the school team or, later in life, for a job. Other stresses are physical such as an acute illness or a broken leg in a car accident."
"Most stressors are mixed: the pain and other physical afflictions of an illness are coupled with worry and concern. Stress is a fundamental process. It affects all organisms, from the simplest bacterium and protozoan, to complex eukaryotes such as mammals."
"In single-celled organisms and in the individual cells of our bodies, molecules have evolved which provide a series of emergency systems that protect key cellular functions from unexpected external challenges and their internal consequences. For example, special molecules called heat-shock proteins guide damaged proteins to where they can be repaired or harmlessly degraded, thus protecting cells from toxicity or dysfunction. In complex organisms such as ourselves, stress systems have evolved as highly sophisticated processes to help deal with out-of-the-ordinary challenges that may afflict us."
"These use the cellular protection mechanisms as building blocks in a larger network of stress protection. Stress is perceived and the response co-ordinated by the brain. Our cognitive appraisal of a situation in the brain interacts with bodily signals in the blood stream such as hormones, nutrients, and inflammatory molecules, and with information from peripheral nerves monitoring vital organs and sensations."
The brain integrates these to produce a series of specific and graded responses. Our understanding of how it does this has come from the study of neuroendocrinology. Circulating hormones in the blood are monitored by the brain to enable the body to cope with stress.
"The easiest response to recognise is the immediate activation of what is - endearingly - called the sympathetic nervous system. After receiving a stressful challenge and computing the right response, the brain rapidly activates nerves originating from control centres in the brainstem. These cause the release of noradrenaline in a variety of structures and of adrenaline from the adrenal glands ."
"Their release underpins the fight or flight response - the classical, immediate reaction that has to be made in response to danger. We all recognise the initial tingling sensation, sweating, heightened awareness, rapid pulse rate, higher blood pressure and general feelings of fear that we all feel in the moments immediately after a stressful challenge. These changes happen because of receptors that are found on blood vessels, causing them to constrict and so our blood pressure to shoot up, and in the heart, causing it to accelerate and produce the pounding sensation in the chest known as palpitations."
"There are also receptors in the skin causing hairs to erect  and in the gut causing those disconcerting abdominal sensations that we all sense as stress. These changes are there to prepare us to fight or to flee - and to concentrate blood flow to vital organs, the muscles and the brain. The second major neuroendocrine response to stress is activation of a circuit linking the body and brain called the HPA axis."
"This links together the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal cortex and hippocampus by a bloodstream highway carrying specialised hormones. The hypothalamus is the key brain area regulating many of our hormones. It has strong inputs from areas of the brain processing emotional information, including the amygdala, and from regions of the brainstem controlling sympathetic nervous responses."
"It integrates these to produce a co-ordinated hormonal output that stimulates the next part of the circuit - the pituitary gland. In turn, this releases a hormone called adrenocorticotrophin  into the blood. ACTH then stimulates a part of the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol."
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is the key to understanding the next phase of the stress response. It raises blood sugar and other metabolic fuels such as fatty acids. This often occurs at the expense of proteins that are broken down into fuels required immediately - instant ‘chocolate bars’ for the muscles and brain.
"Cortisol also helps adrenaline to raise blood pressure and, in the short term, makes you feel good. Faced with the challenge of singing a solo at the school concert, the last thing you want to do is dwell on worrying things. You just want to do it right with as little self-consciousness as possible."
"Cortisol also turns off growth, digestion, inflammation, and even woundhealing - clearly things that can be better done later on. It also turns off sex. The last step of the circuit is cortisol feedback to the brain."
"The highest density of cortisol receptors is in the hippocampus, a key structure for learning and memory, but cortisol also acts on the amygdala, which processes fear and anxiety. The net effect is to turn on the amygdala - to allow learning of fear-related information; and to turn off the hippocampus - to ensure that resources are not wasted on more complex but unnecessary aspects of learning. Cortisol is focus juice."
The hippocampus has high levels of the two receptors for cortisol - let’s call them the low MR and the high GR receptor. The low MR receptor is activated by the normally circulating levels of cortisol in the bloodstream highway of the HPA axis. This keeps our general metabolism and brain processing ticking over nicely.
"However, as cortisol levels begin to rise, particularly in the morning, the high GR receptor becomes progressively more occupied. When we become stressed, cortisol levels become very high indeed, activation of this receptor is sustained and the hippocampus is then shut down by a genetically controlled program. Put all this together and you have what is called a bell-shaped curve."
"This is the classical curve relating stress to brain function - a little bit is good for you, a bit more is better, but too much is bad!  An excess of cortisol in the blood is seen in some chronic brain diseases. In particular, in severe depression cortisol is over-produced and recent work suggests that the hippocampus also shrinks in this condition. Such findings have led psychiatrists to think of severe depression as severe long-term stress."
"It is not at all certain that the increased cortisol is the primary cause of this illness rather than it being simply a consequence of severe psychological upset and its attendant stress. However, patients can be markedly helped by blocking the production or action of cortisol, particularly those in whom classical antidepressant drug treatments do not work. Anti-depressant drugs often help to normalise the overactive HPA axis."
"One idea is that they do so, in part, by adjusting the density of MR and GR receptors in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. Neuroscientists working on this hope to develop more effective treatments for stress disorders that work by resetting the feedback control system and reducing excessive hormonal stress responses. Ageing of the brain is accompanied by a general decline in function, but a decline that varies a great deal between individuals."
"Some individuals maintain good cognitive abilities with age , whilst others do not do so well . Can we get a molecular understanding of this? Cortisol levels are higher in unsuccessful than in successful ageing."
"This rise precedes the fall in mental abilities and the associated decline in the size of the hippocampus seen in brain scans. Experiments in rats and mice have shown that keeping stress hormone levels low from birth, or even from middle age onwards, prevents the emergence of memory defects otherwise seen in untreated populations. So it appears that individuals with excessive hormone responses to stress - not necessarily those who had most stress, but those who make the greatest responses to stressors - are those who get more memory loss and other cognitive disorders with advancing years."
"If this is true in humans as well, we may able to reduce the burden of such effects, perhaps by exploiting antidepressant drugs that keep the HPA stress system under control. Stress is a major feature of modern life - and there is more to the story. But to describe this, we will have to bring in the immune system."
"The immune system is our first line of defence against malicious invaders. These invaders, viruses, bacteria and yeast, range from common and mild, such as the all too familiar cold, to severe and life threatening, e. g."
"HIV, meningitis or tuberculosis. Our defences work in many ways. The first is locally within the tissue that is infected, injured or inflamed, causing swelling, pain, changes in blood flow and release of local inflammatory molecules."
"More generally, activation of the immune system triggers cells called leucocytes and macrophages, and acute phase proteins that travel to the site of attack, to identify, kill and then remove invading pathogens. In addition, the acute phase response generates the symptoms we have all felt . Each of these responses helps to combat infection, conserve energy and aid repair, but when activated too much or for too long they can be very damaging."
"So they need to be carefully controlled. The view of the brain an immunologically privileged organ has now given way to a very different conception of its relationship to the immune system. This is because it is now known that the brain can, and does, respond to signals from the immune system and from damaged tissues."
"The old orthodoxy has been overthrown. Experiments have revealed that the brain exhibits an array of local immune and inflammatory responses, and indeed is an important controller of the immune system and of the acute phase response. Many responses to disease, such as fever , sleep, and appetite, are regulated primarily by the hypothalamus."
"The brain receives signals from injured or infected tissues that may be neural in origin  or humoral . Neural signals seem to be via Cfibres  and via the vagus nerve from the liver – a key site for production of acute phase proteins. The nature of the main circulating signals to the brain are not fully understood, but are believed to include prostaglandins , and complement proteins ."
But perhaps the most important signals are a group of proteins which came to light only in the last 20 years – known as cytokines. Cytokines as defence molecules Cytokines are the body’s retaliators. There are now well over 100 of them - and more are being discovered all the time.
"These proteins are normally produced in the body at very low levels, but are switched on quickly in response to disease or injury. They include interferons, interleukins, tumour necrosis factors and chemokines. Many are produced locally within damaged tissues and act on cells nearby, but some enter the blood stream where they send signals to distant organs including the brain."
"It is cytokines that cause most of the responses to disease and infection. The triggers for cytokine production include bacterial or viral products, damage to cells or threats to cell survival such as toxins or low levels of oxygen. Another important regulator of cytokine production is the brain that, through neural signals to tissues  or hormones , can switch cytokines on or off."
"Cytokines are protein molecules with many actions, particularly on the immune system. Most stimulate the immune system and the key components of inflammation such as swelling, local changes in blood flow, and the release of a second wave of inflammatory molecules. They act on almost all physiological systems, including the liver where they stimulate the acute phase proteins."
"However, although cytokines share many actions, they also vary significantly. Some are anti-inflammatory and inhibit pro-inflammatory process; most act locally on cells close to where they are produced, while others are released into the circulation, like hormones. We have all heard that stress and worry can lower our defences and can make us ill."
"We are now starting to understand not only how stress can affect the brain directly by activating the HPA axis , but also how it can influence the immune system – not surprisingly by an indirect route that is also through the brain. Stress can influence the immune system and susceptibility to disease, but it depends on the type of stress and how we respond - some people clearly thrive on it. It is the sorts of stress that we cannot cope with that can inhibit our defence responses, such as excessive work or major tragedies."
"The precise mechanisms responsible for the link between stress and the immune system are not fully worked out, but we do know that an important feature is activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. One of the main responses to stress in the brain is increased production of a protein in the hypothalamus called corticotrophin releasing factor . CRF travels the short distance from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland to release another hormone, adrenocotrophin releasing factor ."
"This hormone travels via the circulation to the adrenal gland to release steroid hormones , which are some of the most potent suppressors of immune function and inflammation. But the story seems to be more complex than this because there are other hormonal and neural elements, and we also know that some forms of mild stress can actively improve our immune function. Recent research has shown that many of the defence molecules such as cytokines are also active contributors to brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer’s."
It seems that over production of such molecules within the brain itself can damage neurons - particularly certain cytokines. Various new treatment strategies for brain disease are now being developed with the idea of inhibiting immune and inflammatory molecules. So neuroimmunology – a newcomer to the field of neuroscience may provide some clues and possible treatments for major brain diseases.
"The sleep-wake cycle is an endogenous rhythm that gradually becomes locked to the day-night cycle through the first years of life. It is what is called a circadian rhythm - so called because ‘circa’ is Latin for around, and ‘dies’ for day. It is important throughout life: babies sleep for short periods during both the day and the night, young children often take a nap after lunch, while adults generally sleep only at night."
"Sleep is good for you - Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister during World War II, was said to be partial to short naps of five minutes or so - sometimes during cabinet meetings! The normal pattern locking in sleep and wakefulness to the day-night cycle is partly controlled by a small group of cells in the hypothalamus just above the optic chiasm called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The neurons here, which are unusual in having lots of synapses between their dendrites to synchronise their firing together, are part of the brain’s biological clock. In humans, it ticks away at a rate just a bit slower than a day, but is normally kept in register by inputs from the eye telling it when it is day-time or night-time."
"We know this because people who have participated in sleep experiments by living in deep caves for long periods of time, away from all clues as to the true time of day, adopt patterns of activity that free-run to a sleepwaking cycle of about 25 hours. Sleep is not quite the passive process it seems. If a person is wired up with electrodes to their scalp in a sleep laboratory , the brain’s electroencephalogram  passes through several discrete stages."
"When awake, our brains show low-amplitude electrical activity. As we fall asleep, the EEG becomes flatter at first but then, gradually, it shows increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency as we move through a series of discrete stages of sleep. These stages are called slow-wave sleep ."
"The reasons for these changes in electrical activity are still not fully understood. However, it is believed that as neurons in the brain become unresponsive to their normal inputs, they gradually become synchronised with each other. You lose muscle tone as the neurons controlling skeletal muscle movements are actively inhibited but, thankfully, the ones controlling respiration and heart rate carry on working normally! Throughout the night, we cycle back and forth between these different stages of sleep."
"In one of them, the EEG becomes like the waking state again and our eyes jerk back and forth beneath our closed eyelids. This is the so-called rapid eye movement  stage of sleep when we are more likely to dream. If people are woken during REM sleep, they almost invariably report dreaming - even those who habitually claim that they never dream ."
"In fact, most of us will have about 4 to 6 short episodes of REM sleep each night. Babies have a bit more REM sleep and even animals show REM sleep. Some years ago, an American teenager called Randy Gardner resolved to try and win his place in the Guinness book of Records by going without sleep for the longest period ever recorded."
"His ambition was to last 264 hours without sleep - and he did it! It was a carefully controlled experiment supervised by doctors in the American Navy - not one we recommend you repeat! Amazingly, he survived very well. The main difficulties he had  were difficulties with speech, an inability to concentrate, lapses of memory and hallucinatory daydreaming. But his body remained in excellent physical condition and he never became psychotic or lost contact with reality."
"After the experiment was over, he showed a small rebound, sleeping for nearly fifteen hours the first night and short extra periods on succeeding nights. This and many other similar experiments have convinced sleep researchers that it is primarily the brain and not the body that really gains from sleep. Similar conclusions have come from other studies, including carefully controlled animal experiments."
Many issues in neuroscience remain an enigma and sleep is one of them. Some people have argued that sleep is just a convenient way for animals to be kept immobile and so out of danger. But there must be more to it than that.
"The sleep deprivation experiments lead us to think that REM sleep and certain phases of SWS enable the brain to recover. We have this kind of sleep during the first 4 hours of the night. Perhaps it helps to reset things in the brain and that a good time to do this necessary task is, by analogy with a ship in dry dock, when the brain is not processing sensory information, or being vigilant and attentive, or having to control our actions."
"Research also suggests that sleep is the time when we consolidate what we have learned the day before - an essential process in memory. A great deal has been learned about the neural mechanisms of rhythmical activities such as sleep by recording the activity of neurons in various brain areas during the transitions between different sleep stages. These have revealed a brain-stem activating system involving various neuromodulatory transmitters, including one called adenosine, in a kind of molecular chain reaction that takes us through the various sleep stages."
"Synchronisation mechanisms enable networks to pass from one sleep state to another. A big leap forward has come from neurogenetics. Various genes have been identified that, like the cog-wheels and escapement of a clock, are the molecular components of rhythmical pacemakers."
"Much of this work has been done in Drosophila  where it has been found that two genes - per and tim - produce proteins that interact together to regulate their own synthesis. mRNA and protein synthesis begins early in the day, the proteins accumulate, link up together and this linkage then stops their own synthesis. Daylight helps to degrade the proteins whose level eventually drops to a point where the genes that make PER and TIM protein get going again."
"This cycle goes round and round, and will even carry on if the neurons are kept alive in a dish. The clock in mammals such as ourselves operates in a remarkably similar way to the one in flies. As circadian rhythms are very old in evolutionary terms, it is perhaps no surprise that the same types of molecules drive the clock in such different organisms."
"Phrenologists thought they could understand the brain by examining the bumps on the surface of the skull. If this seems far-fetched now, their ambition to understand the brain by looking at it from outside the skull has fascinated many throughout the ages. Now we really can do this – through the advent of modern brain imaging techniques."
"Modern scanners use a variety of means to give us wonderful images of neuronal and fibre pathway structure, of blood flow and energy metabolism in the brain, and of the changes in neural activity that occur when we do different things In attempts to relate structure to function, a great deal has been learned by neurologists and neuropsychologists who correlate any oddities of mind or behaviour with measurements of brain structure at postmortem. It was in this way that the speech areas of the brain were identified by Broca. This approach has had many successes, but it also has limitations."
"One cannot make the simple assumption that the loss of a function due to damage to a region of the brain represents the normal function of that region. For instance, a deficit might occur because that region is cut-off or disconnected from other regions with which it normally communicates. It is also possible that brain areas that are undamaged may take over some functions that are performed by the damaged area under normal circumstances; this is known as plasticity."
"Finally, very few pathological lesions are confined to a precise functional area. And there may be long delay between the study of a patient when they are alive and the later analysis of their brain. Structural brain imaging techniques began to be developed about 30 years ago."
"The recent development of functional imaging methods by medical physicists has attracted particular attention. These enable us – literally - to see inside the skull and so peer into the human brain - as it thinks, learns or dreams. Electrophysiological techniques for monitoring neuronal activity are based on changes in the membrane potential of activated neurons."
Brain scanning techniques work by monitoring changes in energy metabolism required by activate neurons. The electrochemical gradients that move charged ions in and out of neurons  require energy for their operation. The source of this energy is oxidation of glucose.
"Glucose and oxygen are delivered to the brain by the cerebral circulation. By virtue of the neurovascular link, there is a local increase in cerebral blood flow in active areas. This occurs very quickly."
"Modern neuroimaging devices measure these changes in local cerebral blood flow and use them as an index of neural activity. The first functional technique to be developed was called Positron Emission Tomography . This procedure involves the injection, into the humansubjects, of radioactive tracers that are attached to compounds of biological interest ."
"Rings of detectors around the subject’s head record the timing and position of gamma particles emitted by the nuclear isotope as it traverses the brain and decays. PET can be used to produce maps of changes in local cerebral blood flow . Such measurements have led to the localisation in the human brain of sensory, motor and cognitive brain functions."
"There are several disadvantages of PET, the major one being that it requires the injection of radioactive tracers. This means that many people cannot have a PET scan, such as children and women of child-bearing age, and the number of measures taken during a scan are limited. A different technique, called Magnetic Resonance Imaging , was developed that is non-invasive and does not require radioactive substances."
"This allows people of any age to be scanned. MRI can be used to provide very fine-grained images of brain structure, and a recent development called diffusion tensor imaging  permits detailed images of the white matter tracts of fibres that connect brain regions. One of the most exciting applications of MRI technology provides images of brain function: this is called functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ."
"This technique is based on the difference in magnetic properties of oxyhaemoglobin and deoxygenated haemoglobin in blood . As increased neuronal activity leads to movements of ions that activate energy-requiring ion pumps, there is an increase in energy metabolism and oxygen consumption. This leads to an increase in deoxygenated haemoglobin and a decrease of the magnetic signal."
"However increased oxygen consumption is followed within seconds by an increase in local cerebral blood flow. The increase in cerebral blood flow exceeds the increase in oxygen consumption; there is therefore a relative increase in oxyhaemoglobin and the size of the signal. The exact mechanism of the increased cerebral blood flow is still unclear, but neurotransmitter–related signalling is now thought to be responsible."
You’re probably pretty good at subtracting numbers. But have you ever tried subtracting brains? No wonder the boy looks confused .
"Subtracting brain images in 2- and 3 - dimensions turns out to be critical for the data analysis. Most fMRI studies involve measuring the BOLD signal while people are engaged in carefully controlled tasks. During a scan, subjects lie within the bore of a magnet, and their behavioural responses to stimuli are monitored."
"A wide range of stimuli can be presented, either visually, projected onto a screen for the subject to view, or in the auditory domain via headphones. It is possible to examine covert phenomena such as perception, learning, remembering, thinking or planning. Often two very similar tasks are designed with one to be done immediately after the other."
The idea is that the first task should involve the brain process an experimenter is interested in whereas the other should not. The succession of brain images obtained are then subtracted from each other to yield a pixellated 2D image of what changes in activity are specifically associated with performing the critical brain process. These images are stacked up by the computer to yield an effective subtraction of the image in 3 dimensions .
Recent developments mean that even very brief thoughts or brain events  can be measured. This is known as event-related fMRI. Sophisticated methods of data analysis are used to test whether changes in the signal during performance of a task are statistically reliable.
"One widely-used analysis package that has standardized the processing of imaging data is called statistical parametric mapping . SPM maps are often given colours, with a fiery yellow used for the ‘hottest’ areas of activity through to blue and black for ‘cooler’ areas. Brain imaging scientists speak of areas ‘lighting up’ when certain functions are carried out."
"If a person watches a constantly changing checkerboard pattern, substantial activation is observed in the primary visual cortex. The use of moving and coloured colour patterns and other clever stimuli designed to activate different areas of the visual system has given us a great deal of new information about the organisation of the human visual system. Similar studies have been conducted for other sensory modalities."
"This localisational way of thinking has also helped to identify the brain areas involved in distinct components of reading – such as transforming visual words into a phonological code, the grouping of phonemes into whole words, the process of extracting the meaning of words, and so on. Learning tasks have also been studied, including work dissociating the brain areas involved in anticipating and perceiving pain. However, as research has proceeded, various surprises have emerged."
"One early example was the unexpected failure to see the medial temporal lobe lighting up routinely in long term memory tasks. However, newer testing paradigms – some including virtual reality - are now revealing its activity in memory processing along with other areas such as the prefrontal cortex and precuneous. Coupled with new neuropsycholgical and other imaging findings, this diversity of brain areas involved has led to a revision of our understanding of the memory systems of the brain."
"New mathematical techniques are also being developed to look at how the neural activity of different brain regions interacts and correlates during complex tasks - known as effective connectivity). This measure allows us to appreciate how brain areas work as a team and not merely as isolated functional hot spots. The hope is that these new techniques, with magnets of high field strength providing even more precise images, will tell us about the dynamics of networks of neurons talking to each other in the seamless control of perception, thought and action."
"The real brain is squishy stuff. Its neurons, blood vessels and fluid- filled ventricles are made of lipid membranes, proteins and a great deal of water. You can poke the brain with your finger, cut it on a microtome, insert electrodes into its neurons and watch the blood pulsing through it."
"The study of the brain seems firmly anchored in biology and medicine. However, there’s another way of thinking about it that has attracted the attention of mathematicians, physicists, engineers and computer scientists. They think about the brain by writing equations, making computer models and even hardware devices that mimic the real neurons inside our heads."
Real brains are highly adaptable. They are able to do things like read handwriting that we have never seen before and to understand the speech of complete strangers. And they can tolerate things going wrong.
"They function reasonably well for a life-time even though cells are dying and, even in old age, brains are still capable of learning new tricks. Todays’ robots are very good at doing the restricted range of tasks for which they have been designed, like building a bit of a car, but much less tolerant when things go wrong. All real brains consist of highly interconnected neuronal networks."
"Their neurons need energy and the networks need space. Our brain contains roughly 100 billion nerve cells, 3. 2 million kilometers of ‘wires’, a million-billion connections, all packed into a volume of 1."
"5 litres, but weighing only 1. 5 kg and consuming a mere 10 watts. If we tried to build such a brain using silicon chips, it would consume about 10 megawatts, i."
"e. enough electricity to power a town. To make matters worse, the heat produced by such a silicon brain would cause it to melt! The challenge is to discover how brains operate so efficiently and economically, and to use similar principles to build brain-like machines."
The energy cost of signaling - from one neuron to another - has probably been a major factor in the evolution of brains. About 50-80% of the total energy consumption of the brain is consumed in the conduction of action potentials along nerve fibres and in synaptic transmission. The rest is taken in manufacturing and maintenance.
"This is as true for the brain of a bee as it is for ours. However, compared to the speed of digital computers, the speed of nerve impulses is very slow - only a few metres per second. In a serial processor like a digital computer, this would make life impossible."
"Biological brains, however, are constructed as highly parallel networks. Most neurons connect directly to many thousands of others. To do this, the brain exploits its three-dimensional volume to pack everything in - bending the sheets of cells into folds and weaving the connections closely together into bundles."
"By contrast, making connections between even modest numbers of silicon neurons is limited by the two-dimensional nature of chips and circuit boards. So unlike the brain, direct communication between silicon neurons is severely restricted. However, by exploiting the very high speed of conventional electronics, the impulses from many silicon neurons can be ‘multiplexed’ - a process of carrying many different messages along the same wire."
"In this way, silicon engineers can begin to emulate the connectivity of biological networks. To reduce power but increase speed, neurally-inspired engineers have adopted the biological strategy of using analogue rather than digital coding. Carver Mead, one of the ‘gurus’ of silicon valley in California, coined the description ‘neuromorphic engineering’ to describe the translation of neurobiology into technology."
"Instead of coding digitally in 0’s and 1’s, analogue circuits code in continuous changes in voltages, as do neurons in their sub-threshold state . Calculations can then be done in fewer steps because the basic physics of the silicon devices is exploited. Analogue computation easily provides the primitives of a calculus: addition, subtraction, exponentials and integration, all of which are complicated operations in digital machines."
"When neurons - whether biological or silicon - compute and make ‘decisions’ they transmit impulses down axons to communicate the answer to target neurons. Because spike coding is energetically costly, efficient coding maximizes the amount of information represented in a pattern of spikes by reducing what is called redundancy. Energy efficiency is also increased by using as small a number of active neurons as possible."
"This is called sparse coding and it provides another important design principle for engineers building artificial neural networks. One simple artificial version of a biological network has been built consisting of a silicon retina that captures light and adapts its output automatically to changes in overall lighting conditions. It connects to two silicon neurons that, like real neurons in the visual cortex, have the job of extracting information about the angles of lines and contrast boundaries in the retinal image."
"The neurons in this prototype are called integrate-and-fire neurons and neuromorphic engineers use them a lot. They get this name because they ‘add up’ the weighted inputs, coded as voltages that are arriving at their synapses, and only ‘fire’ an action potential if the voltage reaches a set threshold. The silicon neurons themselves are built of transistors, but instead of using the transistors as switches and driving the voltages to saturation as in conventional digital systems, the transistors are operated in their subthreshold range."
"In this range, they act more like the cell membranes of real neurons. Additional transistors provide active conductances to emulate the voltage- and time-dependent current flows of real ion channels. This small visual system is a prototype for much more elaborate artificial visual systems that are under development, but even it illustrates how a very noisy real-world input can be processed rapidly to produce a simple decision."
"It can do what it is designed to do - tell the orientation of a line in a scene - and neuroscientists are already using this simple silicon visual system to test equipment and train students. The most important things about artificial networks is that they operate in the real world, in real time and use very little power. Artificial neural networks  are often used to study learning and memory."
"Usually they software on a conventional digital computer, they consist of a number of simple processing units that are highly interconnected in a network. The simplest form of ANN is a feedforward associator, which has layers of interconnected input and output units. An associative memory is encoded by modifying the strengths of the connections between the layers so that, when an input pattern is presented, the stored pattern associated with that pattern is retrieved ."
"A more complex ANN is a recurrent neural net. This consists of a single layer where every unit is interconnected and all the units act as input and output. It sounds a bit strange, but this design enables the net to store patterns rather than merely pairs of items."
"Decoding this kind of autoassociative network is achieved by a recursive search for a stored pattern. It has been shown that for a network of 1000 units, about 150 patterns can be retrieved before errors in the retrieval patterns become too large. The similarity of ANNs to brains lies in the way they store and process information."
"The ‘knowledge’ that they process resides in the network itself. They have no separate memory location like the digital computer, for which the arithmetic processor and memory addresses are separate. Instead, they have content-addressable storage."
"In an ANN, information is stored in the weights of the connections, the same way that synapses change their strength during learning. Nor are ANNs programmed to perform any given procedure. Each ‘neuron’ inside is ‘dumb’ and simply responds according to the sum of its weighted inputs."
"Still, they can be trained to clever things. The learning rules that train networks do so by modifying the strength of the connections between the neurons, a common one being a rule that takes the output of the network to a given input pattern and compares it with the desired pattern. Any ‘error’ in the comparison is then used to adjust the weights of the connections to achieve a closer output to the desired one."
The network gradually reduces the error signal to a minimum. This works - but only slowly. Mistakes turn out to be important - no learning is possible if the network cannot make mistakes.
This is a feature of learning that can get overlooked. Over-trained networks that made no errors would end up responding only to one type of input. Such networks are metaphorically called grandmothered - a reference to mythical ‘grandmother cells’ in the human brain that might respond only when one’s grandmother comes into view and must never make a mistake! This is not very useful in real world applications because everything we had to learn would require a separate network.
"On the contrary, the neat thing about ANNs lies in their ability to generalize to input patterns they have never been exposed to in training. They see relationships, capture associations and discover regularities in patterns. And they are fault - tolerant just like real brains."
They can still retrieve a stored pattern even when the input pattern is noisy or incomplete. These are very important properties for biological brains and ANNs can do these things too. The paradox of present-day ANNs is that they are simulated mathematically on digital computers.
"This makes their use in real - world situations much more limited, because the simulation takes time and so the ANNs cannot operate in real time. ANNs might seem well-suited to drive an automobile, or fly an aircraft, because they are robust in the face of noise and keep going when some units in the network cease to work. However, the expert systems that are generally used in automatic pilots are digital computers programmed with conventional deterministic software and, for safety, this always require a backup."
"If things ever go badly wrong with the aircraft, such expert systems cannot cope. The human pilot must take over. Present-day training algorithms for ANNs are too slow for such emergencies."
"If silicon neurons could learn, which so far they can’t, then many of these problems would fall away. As we learn more about the way in which brains work, we will be able to build more sophisticated neural networks that will provide real brain-like performance. The brain is a delicate organ."
Accidents can cause head injury and the brain can become diseased and stop working normally. Diseases of the brain can produce an astonishing range of symptoms and understanding these can be difficult. The assessment of brain disorders requires the clinical skills of the neurologist or psychiatrist at the bedside as well as sophisticated biomedical assays and brain imaging.
"Research about brain disorders requires an even wider range of expertise. Some disorders, such as epilepsy and depression, are quite common - even in children and teenagers. Others are less common, such as Schizophrenia, or only common in old-age, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, but they are no less disabling."
"Some have a strong genetic component, raising difficult questions about whether each of us would want to know if we had relevant mutations predisposing us to such conditions. During a seizure , the person loses consciousness and may fall to the ground, become stiff and shake. When they come round, they may find that they have bitten their tongue or wet themselves."
"They may be confused or sleepy afterwards. Many children are affected, but they may go on to have very few attacks later in their life. For some, unfortunately, these can be every week or even every day."
"So what is going wrong? During seizures, there is an increase in the firing of action potentials by neurons followed by a period of reduced excitability. This cyclical process is modulated by inhibitory  and excitatory  neurotransmitters."
"When the reduction in excitability is incomplete, seizures may be triggered by the uncontrolled recruitment of neighbouring neurons. This recruitment may be localised , or may spread to the entire cortex . During a generalised seizure, the normal alpha rhythym of the electroencephalogram  is replaced by large, slow, synchronous waves of electrical activity in both cerebral hemispheres ."
"Isolated seizures are fairly common, but recurring seizures – epilepsy - is both less frequent and more troublesome. Its immediate causes are still unclear. In people with epilepsy, attacks may be provoked by tiredness, missed meals, low blood sugar, alcohol, or flickering television screens."
"Those afflicted have to be careful. Neuroscience research has made two major contributions to improving the lives of people with epilepsy. First, through our developing understanding of excitatory transmission, we can now design drugs that dampen down abnormal seizure activity without damping down normal brain activity."
"Older drugs tended to act as generalised sedatives, whereas modern ones are much more selective. Second, improvements in the quality of brain imaging means that for some people with severe disabling seizures, it is possible to localise the source of their seizures quite accurately. It is then sometimes possible for a neurosurgeon to cut out this diseased brain tissue with a resulting decrease in seizure frequency and a reduced risk of it spreading to brain tissue that is still unaffected."
"The surgical management of epilepsy is sometimes thought to be a bit drastic, but it is remarkable how often it works. Most people experience headache at some time. Usually this is caused by muscle tension and is nothing serious to worry about."
"Very occasionally - especially if the headache comes on very quickly, or is associated with a skin rash or with vomiting – there can be a serious underlying cause. In these conditions the pain comes not from the brain itself, but from irritation or stretching of the meninges - the lining of the brain. A more common cause of headache is migraine."
"As well as a sore head , people feel sick, find bright lights or loud noises discomforting, and experience a migrainous aura consisting of flashing lights or jagged lines. The aura generally precedes the headache. It now seems likely that migraine starts in the part of the brain that processes pain sensations coming from cerebral blood vessels."
"Brain imaging reveals increased activity in these regions at the start of a migraine. In response, there is a brief increase in local blood supply , immediately followed by reduced blood flow . The last decade has seen a revolution in the treatment of migraine attacks following advances in our understanding of serotonin  receptors."
A new class of drugs was discovered which activated a particular subgroup of serotonin receptors. These drugs – triptans - are very effective at stopping a migraine headache in its tracks. This is one of a number of ways in which neuroscience research has made a huge contribution to improving the lives of millions of people around the world.
"When people suddenly develop a weakness down one side of the body, this is usually due to a stroke affecting the opposite side of the brain. Balance, sensation or language and speech may also be affected. Sometimes these abnormalities get better with time, even to the point of apparent normality, but stroke is still a very common cause of death and disability."
"Strokes come in different shapes and sizes, and the consequences depend very much on the part of the brain that is affected. What has gone wrong has to do with interruption of the energy supply that the brain needs to function. Neurons and glia need fuel to work and to survive."
"That fuel is delivered through the four major blood vessels that supply the brain. The most important fuels are oxygen, and carbohydrate in the form of glucose; together these provide the raw materials to make ATP - the energy currency of cells. This energy  is necessary for driving the flow of charged ions that underlie the electrical activity of neurons."
"About two thirds of a neuron’s energy is used to fuel an enzyme called Sodium/ Potassium ATPase which recharges the ionic gradients of sodium and potassium after an action potential has occurred. In what is called a transient ischaemic attack , the blood supply to a part of the brain fails and the supply of ATP is interrupted. Neurons cannot recharge their ionic gradients and so can no longer conduct action potentials."
"If, for example, the blood supply to the motor cortex of the left hemisphere were to be cut off, the right arm and leg would become paralysed. If the obstruction passes quickly, neurons can again make ATP, recharge their membranes and normal function will resume. Fortunately, no permanent damage occurs in TIA."
"A stroke is more serious. If the blood supply is cut off for a prolonged period, irreversible damage can occur. In the absence of ATP, cells cannot maintain homeostasis and they may swell up and burst."
"Neurons may also spontaneously depolarise, releasing potentially toxic neurotransmitters such as glutamate. And glial cells, that normally mop up excess glutamate through an ATP-dependent pump, also stop working. In the absence of energy, the life of a brain cell becomes very precarious."
"Through careful study of what happens during a stroke, neuroscientists have been able to develop new treatments. Most strokes are caused by blood clots blocking vessels and treatment with a “clot-busting” drug called tissue plasminogen activator  can break up the clot and restore blood flow. Given quickly enough, TPA can have a dramatic effect on the outcome."
"Unfortunately, getting such a drug to a stroke patient quickly isn’t easy as it may not be obvious to a victim’s family what is happening. Another new treatment is a class of drugs that block neurotransmitters including glutamate that accumulate to toxic levels during a stroke. These drugs can either block glutamate receptors themselves or the intracellular signalling pathways that are turned on by glutamate."
"Many such drugs are in development. Sadly, none has yet had an impact on stroke. Doctors have long recognised and diagnosed brain disease according to the region affected."
"For many diseases, the name is a description of what appears to be wrong and the part of the brain involved, often dressed up in Latin or Greek, such as “parietal apraxia”. The explosion of genetic information in the last ten years has changed things completely. For many inherited diseases, the problem lies elsewhere."
Some people inherit a problem with the fine control of movements that makes them increasingly unsteady on their feet as the years go by. Called spinocerebellar ataxia - a name that reflects the classical history in the naming of diseases – we now know the precise gene defects that cause it. Many other conditions can now be classified according to their cause and diagnostic genetic testing is now routine for patients suspected of spinocerebellar ataxia or other genetic conditions.
The diagnosis can be made more quickly and with much greater certainty than before. Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with abnormal involuntary movements of the body - in this case named after the doctor who first described the condition. It is entirely due to a repeat mutation in one of the largest genes in the human genome called huntingtin.
"Some early onset forms of Parkinson’s disease  are due to problems in genes coding for Parkin. As well as helping with diagnosis, genetic testing can be used to advise other family members about their risks of developing diseases, or passing it on to their children. However, much as the genetics revolution has changed the way that doctors deal with diseases of the nervous system, it is only the start of a long voyage of discovery."
"The same gene defect can cause different diseases in different people, and different gene defects can cause very similar diseases. Understanding what it is that defines these differences, and how your genetic makeup interacts with the world in which you live and which you build around you, is one of the next great challenges for the genomic era in which we live. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of young adults."
"It is characterised by repeated episodes of weakness, numbness, double vision or poor balance, that last for a few weeks before recovery - apparently back to normal. The cycle between periods of illness and remission is a feature of the disease. Multiple sclerosis is caused by inflammation in the nervous system that flares up and then settles down again."
Our immune system is designed to fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. Sometimes it gets confused and starts attacking parts of us instead. We call such conditions autoimmune diseases and they can affect almost any tissue.
"If the immune system attacks the myelin that wraps around neurons, there will be a local area of inflammation that causes demyelination. In time, the inflammation usually settles down, the myelin is repaired, and things return to normal. Quite what sparks off the inflammation in the first place is not clear, and many people with demyelination only ever have one brief episode."
"However, some people seem to have a tendency to have recurrent bouts affecting different parts of the brain. Because we do not yet know what triggers inflammation in multiple sclerosis, we cannot completely stop it. However, we now do know that the attacks can be made shorter using drugs such as steroids that dampen down the immune system."
"For patients with severe MS, some doctors believe that permanently dampening down certain parts of the immune system with drugs like azathioprine or ß-interferon can be beneficial. There is still considerable uncertainty about their use. The immune system can also attack the junctions where nerves connect with muscles, causing a disease called myasthenia gravis, or the nerves as they emerge from the spinal cord, resulting in a condition called Guillain Barré syndrome."
"It is our brains that make us who we are: how we react in different situations, with whom we fall in love, what we fear, what we remember. This fundamental aspect of human nature is laid bare when our brains fail in the progressive disorder known as Alzheimer’s Disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia – a global loss of faculties that affects approximately 5% of 65 years olds and 25% of those aged 85 or older."
"This is a heartbreaking illness: the condition usually starts with memory failure, and progresses to a loss of normal personhood and ultimately death. To watch loved ones lose themselves in this fashion is an exceptionally difficult experience for relatives. Ultimately, sufferers may be unable to recognise those closest to them and will require help with everyday activities such as dressing, eating, bathing and toileting."
"Consequently, their carer’s life is changed dramatically also. What is going wrong? As Alzheimer’s disease develops, brain cells die: the cortex thins and the ventricles  enlarge."
"The diagnosis is usually made in life on the basis of the characteristic clinical features, but can only be confirmed definitively at a post-mortem when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the cell loss, and the widespread abnormal deposition of an amyloid protein in scattered small degenerating amyloid plaques and a tangled mess of rod-like proteins that are normal constituents of brain cells - fibrillary tangles. Current research projects are trying to improve diagnosis in life with new neuropsychological testing procedures focused on distinguishing the mental changes in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s from those in, for example, depression. Again, genetics has provided a handle to get us started in understanding the disease – pointing to mutations in genes that encode amyloid precursor protein  and the presenilins ."
"Inheritance of a particular variation of the apolipoprotein E  gene designated apoE-4 is also a major risk factor in the disease. However, genetic factors do not tell the whole story: environmental factors, such as toxins and other insults such as traumatic brain injury, may also play an important role. But genetic factors are sufficiently important that genetically altered laboratory animals have been bred that show features of the disease."
"Research on these has to be interpreted very carefully, and not over-interpreted, but they can help us get a grasp on the biology of the disease process. Treatments that stem the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease still do not exist, although they are eagerly sought - and this is where the animal research is so valuable. It is known that nerves cells utilising the chemical transmitter acetylcholine are particularly vulnerable to attack in the condition."
"Drugs that boost the action of the remaining acetylcholine by blocking the effect of enzymes that normally destroy this neurotransmitter have a modest treatment effect in both animal models and some clinical cases. However, these drugs do nothing to slow the progression of this still incurable disease. Drawing together genetic clues, understanding relationships between brain chemistry and psychological function, and learning more about the mechanisms by which cells are damaged seems to be the way forward in ultimately defeating the disorder."
t may come as a surprise to learn that depression and neurodegeneration can be bedfellows – but we now know that severely depressed patients can lose brain cells. A depressive illness is very different from the low feelings we all experience from time to time. We are dealing with a truly serious medical condition when low mood becomes prolonged for weeks and months.
"It then begins to take over everything – to the extent that sufferers want to die and may try to kill themselves. Sufferers display other characteristic symptoms: disturbed sleep, lowered appetite, failing concentration and memory, and a loss of interest in life. Fortunately, it is eminently treatable."
"Antidepressant drugs, which enhance the effects of neuromodulatory transmitters such as serotonin and noradrenaline can rapidly  treat the illness. Specialised talking treatments are also effective, and a combination of chemical and psychological treatments can be especially helpful. The condition is surprisingly common – 1 in 5 may suffer at some time in their lives from some degree of depressive disorder."
"Being severely and chronically depressed has an unbalancing effect on the control of stress  hormones, such as cortisol, that are beneficially released acutely during stressful situations . However, when chronically activated, stress hormones may actually damage brain cells, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It has recently been found that antidepressant drugs promote the integrity of brain cells and increase the rate at which new neurons are produced in the hippocampus."
"In this way, they may go some way to protect against and even reverse the toxic effects of stress on the brain. Another psychiatric disorder that draws together abnormalities of brain chemistry and brain structure is schizophrenia. This is a progressive and potentially very disabling condition that affects 1 in 100."
"The condition often starts in early adulthood and is said to blight more lives than cancer. The core symptoms of schizophrenia are delusions  and hallucinations . There is often a progressive decline in cognitive ability, social interaction and ability to work."
"The condition is much misunderstood: it has nothing to do with “split personality” with which it is often confused, nor as a rule are sufferers in any way violent. Indeed, most people with schizophrenia are fearful rather than dangerous. There are clearly genetic factors at work in the genesis of the illness, but as with other conditions, environment and stress are also important."
"Nonetheless, for all the obvious psychological changes, the condition is primarily a brain disease. It has long been known that the ventricles of the brain enlarge in the condition, and that the activity of the frontal lobes becomes impaired. Drugs that block dopamine receptors are helpful in reducing the frequency and impact of symptoms, but they do not cure the condition."
"The latest research suggests that, when activated experimentally using drugs such as amphetamine, it is possible to detect abnormalities in the release of dopamine in people with schizophrenia. There is much more to be discovered about the disorder: post-mortem studies suggest that the way that neurons have connected up during development may be abnormal, and that other neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, may be malfunctioning. Our efforts to understand the nature of mental disorders represents the last great frontier for medical neuroscience."
Organisations such as the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust have put mental health high on their agenda for research over the next decade. One important current project is capitalising on both genetic knowledge and brain scanning equipment to study the disease prospectively - in families at risk . Bridging the gaps from “molecules to bedside” remains one of the most challenging research endeavours.
"Once upon a time, a very long time ago , there was a clear distinction between science and technology. Scientists pursued an unbridled path in search of truth, wherever that might lead, for no more reward than the “the pleasure of finding out”. Engineers and technologists applied the fruits of scientific endeavour to change the world in which we live."
"However beguiling this sharp distinction may seem, it is and always has been a fairy-tale. Nowadays, scientists are ever more aware of the social context in which they work, and how that context can affect what they study. Questions relating to the impact of neuroscience on society are collected under the general heading of neuroethics - the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy and ethics."
This includes how discoveries about the brain affect our sense of ourselves as human beings . It is about the implications for social policy  and how research is itself conducted . And it is about how neuroscientists should best engage with the public in communicating what they do and sharing idea about what they should be doing.
"While some neuroscientists believe that their concepts are divorced from social reality, this is rarely so. In the 17th C, Descartes used a hydraulic metaphor to explain how the “humours” of the brain moved the muscles - a metaphor borrowed from the water engineering he saw in the gardens of French chateaux. At the turn of the 20th C, reflecting the industrial age, neurophysiologists described the intricate wiring of the brain as “an enchanted loom” or later as a giant “telephone exchange”."
"Now, at the start of the 21st C, computational metaphors abound, such as the fanciful speculation that “the cerebral cortex operates not unlike a private world wide web”. These are partly shorthand to help convey complex ideas, but also concepts that are actually built into sophisticated brain theories. Neuroscientists can and do engage in thinking about scientific problems divorced from the everyday world."
"Often this escape is into an abstract, jargon-filled world in which something quite close to a monastic search for truth really is underway. Whether it is working out the ionic currents that underlie the propagation of the actionpotential, how chemical messengers are released and act, or how cell-firing in the visual cortex represents aspects of the visual world - many problems in neuroscience can be cast in an isolated but tractable manner. But the real world is never far away."
"Once we know how chemical transmitters work, it is natural to think about smart drugs that may help us remember better. Some might think about designing neurotoxins  that disrupt this critical process, such as enzyme inhibitors that are but a step from the agents of biological warfare. If a drug were available that could help you pass examinations, would you take it?"
"Is there any difference between this and an athlete using steroids to improve their performance or a person taking an anti-depressant? Less fanciful ethical dilemmas surround the future of brain-imaging. For example, brain-imaging techniques may soon make it feasible, with appropriate testing procedures, to distinguish a person’s real memories from their false ones."
"The variability in response is too big just now, but courts may one day have brain-scanning technology at their disposal - a kind of “cerebral fingerprinting” that could help establish the veracity of witnesses. This raises interesting issues about what one might call cognitive privacy. New findings about the brain are all the time revising our sense of ourselves."
"Influential ideas about the evolution of the brain include many related to social cognition. There is an emerging awareness that morality and conscience are closely coupled to the emotional brain that processes signals of reward and punishment – a possibility that some have argued under the rubric of evolutionary ethics. Learning more about these could be an immense force for good, helping us to be more aware of each other’s feelings."
"Building these ideas into our presently primitive concepts of neuronal plasticity could yet have an impact on education beyond the immediate academic goals that are so often the only focus of discussion. It is also important to appreciate that neuroscientists do not agree about the future directions of their subject. For some molecular neurobiologists, ultimate truth lies embedded in the molecular constituents of the nervous system - with new DNA and proteomic technologies promising fuller explanations of the brain that will finesse the problems faced by other neuroscientists."
"This is the reductionist agenda, whose full philosophical and technological flowering is so often celebrated in media accounts. But is such a reductionist confidence justified? Or are there higher-level explanations of brain and mind that are not reducible in this way?"
"Are there emergent properties arising from the brain’s organization? Interactionist neuroscientists firmly believe in a different agenda. They argue for a more eclectic approach to modern neuroscience, an approach that explores its interaction with the social sciences as well."
"These are not issues easily discussed in a public forum, but questions about what sorts of research should be undertaken are matters about which society should be consulted. After all, people’s taxes help to pay for it. Certain issues in neuroethics yield to little more than common-sense."
Suppose a brain scan of a volunteer subject in an experiment was unexpectedly to reveal a cerebral abnormality - such as brain tumour. Or imagine that a subject in a human neurogenetics screen was found to have a mutation that rendered them susceptible to a neurodegenerative disease. In each of these cases - should the subject be told?
"Common sense suggests that responsibility should be passed to the volunteer who, in advance, would be asked to offer or decline their consent that any relevant medical information discovered in the course of the scan be passed on. However, informed consent is a funny business. Suppose a brain researcher was conducting a trial of a new treatment for stroke in which either the drug or a placebo had, in a blind fashion, to be given within a few hours of the stroke."
"There are sound scientific reasons for such a randomised protocol. But we cannot anticipate who will suffer a stroke and it may be impossible for the person affected to give informed consent. If this prevents the patient participating in such a research project, it would be to their long-term detriment and that of later patients."
"Relatives also may not be in a state of mind where it is easy for them to make a judgement of consent in the time available. Dare we abandon informed consent and introduce waivers, for the greater good? Or is that a slippery slope?"
"Another important aspect of neuroethics relates to animal experiments. Animals are not in a position to offer consent for invasive experiments to be conducted on their brains. To some people, the prospect of such work is disturbing."
"To others, the opportunity it offers for advancing our understanding of the nervous system in health and disease is such that not to pursue it is irrational. These are not easy issues to debate dispassionately, but it is important that we do - and that we do so respectfully. In most European countries, animal experiments are regulated in an extremely strict manner."
"Researchers must attend courses and pass examinations that test their knowledge of the law and their competence in ensuring that unnecessary animal suffering does not occur. There is a widespread acceptance that three Rs - reduction, refinement and replacement - are good principles for biomedical scientists to comply with. They do so willingly, within a framework of law, and so command widespread if not unanimous public acceptance."
"Many new findings in neuroscience are emerging from replacement techniques, such as tissue culture and computational modelling. But these cannot replace all studies of the living brain from which many new findings and treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases are coming. For instance, the use of L-DOPA to treat Parkinson’s disease emerged from Nobel Prize winning work on the rat brain."
"And new techniques offer new opportunities to help sick people and sick animals. It is a puzzling truth that countries in which scientists do most to communicate to the general public tend to be those in which there are lower levels of trust in scientists. But correlation is not the same as cause, and it is unlikely that this responsible effort to engage the public in discussing the impact of science on society - and the growing sense of duty to do so - is the cause of this growing distrust."
"Rather it is that the interested public is getting more sophisticated, properly more sceptical of new “miracle drugs”, and more aware of the slow and sometimes uncertain progress of science. Reducing distrust is no reason to favour a return to blind ignorance. One reason to engage with young people and the interested public about neuroscience is that neuroscientists still disagree about many of the central tenets of their field."
"Instead of focusing on isolated discoveries, the media would do well to think more about science as a process. A process riddled with uncertainty and debate. Neuroethics is a new field."
"There is curious irony that it was Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist, who described his reason for doing science as being for “the pleasure of finding out”. Ironic - because it was Feynman who threw himself headlong into working out why one of the American Space Shuttles, Challenger, exploded soon after take-off. The impact of science on society creeps up on us all."
"The human nervous system is an extremely efficient, compact, fast, and reliable computing system, yet it weighs substantially less than most computers and performs at an incredibly greater capacity. It has the capability of performing tasks that are far beyond the abilities of any computer yet devised. The present textbook deals mostly with the anatomy of the central nervous system, and in case the reader wonders why we study neuroanatomy, we should remember that it is our central nervous system more than anything else about us that makes us what we are, human beings."
"The nervous system is subdivided, morphologically, into two compartments, the central nervous system , the brain and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system , which emanates from and is a physical extension of the CNS. The PNS is composed of cranial and spinal nerve fibers and ganglia. Functionally, the nervous system is also subdivided into two components, the somatic nervous system, which is under the individual’s conscious control, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls the myriad of activities in conjunction with the voluntary nervous system."
"The autonomic nervous system is a tripartite organization, in that it has a sympathetic, a parasympathetic, and an entreric component. Simply stated, the first initiates the “flight or fight” response, the second is concerned with the body’s vegetative activities, whereas the enteric nervous system is involved in regulating the process of digestion. It must be understood, however, that the interplay of these three systems maintains homeostasis."
"The autonomic nervous system acts upon three cell types to perform its functions, these are cells of glands, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Moreover, the nervous system has two other functional components, sensory and motor. The sensory component collects information and transmits it to the CNS , where the information is sorted, analyzed, and processed."
"Generally speaking, the motor component delivers the results of the analysis away from the CNS  to the effector organs, i. e. , muscles and glands, resulting in a response to the stimulus."
"Discussion of the topics of neuroanatomy requires that the student be familiar with some of the specialized terminology of the subject matter. One of the problems that students have in studying neuroanatomy is that there is a plethora of terms applied to the same or similar structures. It is important, therefore, to begin the discussion of this subject matter by listing and defining in Table 1."
"1 some of the terminology the student will encounter. of neurons  but they all have similar structures and functions. Neurons are capable of receiving, conducting, and transmitting impulses to each other as well as to muscle cells and cells of glands."
"Usually, neurons receive information at processes known as dendrites and transmit information along their single axon. Thus dendrites conduct information toward the cell body, whereas axons conduct information away from the cell body. Neurons usually communicate with each other as well as with other cells at synapses, where neurotransmitter substances are released from the axon terminal of the first neuron and bind to receptor molecules on the surface of the second neuron ."
"Neurons may also communicate with each other via gap junctions, intercellular pores that permit the movement of small secondary messenger molecules from the cytoplasm of one cell into the cytoplasm of the neighboring cell, initiating a requisite response in the target cell. Additional cells, known as neuroglia, constitute several categories of non-neuronal supporting cells. Those in the central nervous system are known as macroglia, ependymal cells, and microglia."
"The first two are derived from cells of the neural tube, whereas microglia are macrophages whose origins are monocyte precursors of the bone marrow. Ependymal cells form a simple cuboidal epithelium that lines the central canal of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. Additionally, these cells also participate in the formation of the choroid plexus, vascular tufts of tissue that manufacture cerebrospinal fluid."
"Macroglia is a collective term for the protoplasmic astrocytes, fibrous astrocytes, and oligodendroglia. Protoplasmic astrocytes support neurons in the gray matter, form a subpial barrier, and envelop capillaries of the CNS. Fibrous astrocytes are located in the white matter and appear to function in a similar fashion to protoplasmic astrocytes."
Astrocytes also function in scavenging ions and neurotransmitter substances from the extracellular spaces. Oligodendroglia form myelin sheaths around axons and also surround dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the CNS. Schwann cells are located in the PNS and they function in forming myelin around axons of the PNS.
"They also envelop unmyelinated axons. The central nervous system is a complex, hollow tube, whose rostral end, the brain, is enlarged and folded in an elaborate manner, whereas its caudal end, the spinal cord, is a long, tubular structure . The brain is housed in the cranial cavity and at the foramen magnum is continuous with the spinal cord, housed in the vertebral canal."
"The dorsal surface of the spinal cord is closer to the spinous processes of the vertebrae, whereas its ventral surface is closer to the bodies of the vertebrae. Since the CNS, as well as most of the body, is bilaterally symmetric, the sagittal  plane bisects it into right and left halves. Positioning toward the sagittal plane is considered to be the medial direction and away from the sagittal plane is the lateral direction."
"The brain is subdivided into five major regions, the largest being the telencephalon, which is composed of the cerebral hemispheres; the other regions are: the diencephalon, whose component parts are the epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus and subthalamus; the mesencephalon, consisting of the cerebral peduncles  and the tectum ; the metencephalon, including the pons and cerebellum; and the myelencephalon . Frequently the medulla oblongata, mesencephalon, and the pons are collectively termed the brainstem. The lumen of the CNS is a narrow slit, the central canal, in the spinal cord, but is expanded into a system of ventricles in the brain and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid."
"Twelve pairs of cranial nerves emerge from the brain to supply motor, sensory, and parasympathetic innervation for the head and neck and much of the viscera of the body. The spinal cord  is a cylindrical aggregate of nervous tissue, where white matter surrounds a central cylinder of gray matter. The neurons of the spinal cord are arranged in such a fashion that those concerned with somatic motor function are located in the ventral horn and their axons leave via the ventral rootlets."
"These are accompanied by axons of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons, located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord in the thoracic and upper lumbar regions, and axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons located in the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is the location where central processes of unipolar neurons of dorsal root ganglia enter the spinal cord via dorsal rootlets bringing sensory information to the CNS. Interneurons connect two neurons to each other ."
"Thus, interneurons have the capability of facilitating or inhibiting a motor response to a sensory stimulus. For example, if you prick your finger the reflex response is to pull the finger away from the offending stimulus; however, if a health professional sticks your finger for a blood test, the interneuron inhibits the withdrawal of the finger. The white matter of the spinal cord is composed of ascending and descending tracts of nerve fibers that connect regions of the CNS to one another."
"Ventral and dorsal rootlets at each level of the spinal cord join each other to form the spinal nerves that leave the spinal cord at regular intervals, indicative of its segmentation. Attached to each dorsal root is a dorsal root ganglion, housing the soma of the unipolar  neurons. The nerve cell bodies of the CNS are grouped into large aggregates, known as gray matter."
"Gray matter may be arranged in sheaths, as in the cerebral cortex, or as a smaller collection of nerve cell bodies, known as a nucleus . There are two major categories of neurons, those whose axons leave the CNS and interneurons, whose axons remain within the CNS. The first group, called principal cells by some neuroanatomists, are generally motoneurons , whereas interneurons relay information from one  of neurons to a second  of neurons within the CNS ."
"White matter is composed of processes of neurons, many of whose axons are wrapped in a myelin sheath, which in a living individual has a white color. These axons are collected into small bundles, known as fasciculi, or large bundles, called funiculi. Certain larger fiber bundles are named tracts or capsules, whereas axons that cross the midline to connect identical structures on opposing sides are known as commissures."
"Axons that travel up or down the CNS and cross the midline from one side to the other are said to decussate at the point of crossing over. The peripheral nervous system is composed of cranial nerves, spinal nerves, their associated ganglia, and nerve fibers of the autonomic nervous system. It must be understood that the PNS is in physical continuity with the CNS, in fact cell bodies of many of the nerve fibers  of the PNS are located in the CNS."
"There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves, identified both by name as well as by Roman numerals I through XII. All cranial nerves, with the exception of the vagus , serve structures in the head and neck only. The vagus nerve has responsibilities in the head and neck, but also serves many of the thoracic and abdominal viscera, e."
"g. , the heart and alimentary tract. Those cranial nerves that have sensory components possess sensory ganglia housing the cell bodies of unipolar neurons whose single process bifurcates into a central and a peripheral process."
"The central process of a unipolar neuron enters the brain, whereas its peripheral process goes to a sensory receptor. There are no synapses occurring in these sensory ganglia. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves , attesting to the segmentation of the spinal cord ."
"The cell bodies of sensory neurons  are located in the dorsal root ganglia . Again, it must be remembered that there are no synapses occurring in the dorsal root ganglia. The single process of each neuron bifurcates and the short central process joins other central processes to form dorsal rootlets that enter the spinal cord."
"The peripheral process goes to a sensory receptor, which, when stimulated, causes depolarization of the peripheral process; the wave of depolarization spreads to the central process, which transmits the stimulus either to an interneuron  or to a motoneuron . Although the above description is true for reflex arcs, it must be realized that in most instances the incoming information is transmitted to higher levels in the brain and is processed either cognitively or subconsciously, or both, rather than just relying on simple reflex phenomena. These motoneurons are multipolar neurons whose cell bodies are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and serve skeletal muscle cells only."
"Their axons leave via the ventral rootlets that join the dorsal rootlets to form the spinal nerve. Each spinal nerve bifurcates to form a smaller dorsal primary ramus and a larger ventral primary ramus. Dorsal primary rami supply sensory and motor innervation to the back, whereas ventral primary rami supply the lateral and anterior portion of the trunk."
"Ventral rami that supply the thorax and abdomen usually remain as separate nerves, whereas those of the cervical and lumbosacral regions join each other to form plexuses from which individual nerve bundles arise to serve the head, neck, and upper and lower extremities. Each spinal nerve receives sensory information from the skin of the segment, or dermatome, of the body that it serves. The entire body is mapped into a number of dermatomes; however, there are overlaps in the innervation, so that a single dermatome is supplied by more than one spinal nerve."
"Such overlaps prevent the total anesthesia of a particular dermatome if the dorsal rootlets of the spinal nerve supplying it are damaged. The autonomic nervous system is a motor system, but unlike somatic motoneurons, it does not serve skeletal muscle cells, instead it innervates cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, and secretory cells of glands. Additionally, whereas a somatic motoneuron directly innervates its muscle cell , in the autonomic nervous system the neuron whose cell body is located in the CNS  synapses with a second neuron  located in a ganglion in the PNS."
"It is the axon of the postganglionic neuron that synapses with the cardiac muscle cell, smooth muscle cell, or secretory cell of a gland. Thus the autonomic nervous system is said to be a two cell system, and synapses always occur within an autonomic ganglion . The axon of the preganglionic neuron is myelinated and is known as the preganglionic fiber."
"The axon of the postganglionic neuron is not myelinated, and is known as the postganglionic fiber. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, and is composed of three functional components: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric. The sympathetic component prepares the body for “fight and flight,” whereas the parasympathetic prepares the body for a vegetative state ."
"The enteric nervous sytem is situated completely within the wall of the digestive tract and controls the entire process of digestion. Although the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system modulate its activities, the enteric nervous system can function quite well on its own if the sympathetic and parasympathetic components are severed. Cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord , whereas those of the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in the brain  and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord ."
"Postganglionic cell bodies of sympathetic neurons are usually located near the spinal cord, within the sympathetic chain ganglia, or a little farther away, in collateral ganglia. The cell bodies of postganglionic parasympathetic neurons, however, are located in ganglia that are in the vicinity of the viscera being innervated. The cell bodies of the sensory neurons that supply the viscera are located in the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves or in the sensory ganglia of cranial nerves, along with the somatic sensory neurons."
"However, their peripheral processes accompany the preganglionic autonomic fibers into their respective ganglia, but do not synapse in those ganglia. Moreover, these peripheral fibers continue to accompany the postganglionic autonomic fibers to the same destinations. In spite of their route, these sensory neurons are not considered to be a part of the autonomic nervous system."
"Sensory information relayed by these autonomic sensory nerves are not registered as part of the conscious experience, and even pain sensations are experienced as “referred pain” in somatic regions of the body ). Embryogenesis, the development of the future individual, begins with the fusion of the male and female gametes, the spermatozoon and the oocyte, respectively. This occurs in the fallopian tube ."
"The process of fusion is known as fertilization, subsequent to which the fertilized ovum is referred to as a zygote, the very beginning of a new individual . The mitotic activity of the zygote is responsible for the increase in the number of cells that will be required for the construction of the future individual as well as for the embryonic component of the supporting structures that will ensure the requisite nourishment for normal development and growth of the future embryo. The normal development of the embryo is divided into a number of stages and the interested reader is referred to a textbook of human embryology."
"In the present textbook, human embryology is presented from the perspective of neuroanatomy and only those aspects of human development are presented that will assist the student in appreciating the complexity and beauty of how the nervous system progresses from an ill-defined cluster of cells to an amazingly intricate functional unit. In order for the reader to be able to grasp the manner in which this process occurs, it is advisable to show not only the development of the nervous system per se, but also that of the structures that envelop and surround the nervous system. Therefore, this chapter includes a description of early embryology, the development of the pharyngeal arches, formation of the face, and some of the molecular events that appear to govern this entire process."
"The zygote undergoes a series of mitotic divisions, known as cleavage, which will result in the formation of a solid cluster of cells, where each cell is smaller than the original zygote. This cluster of cells resembles a mulberry, and hence is known as the morula. The cells of the morula secrete a viscous fluid that creates a central cavity by pushing the cells to the periphery until a hollow ball of cells is formed, known as the blastocyst ."
"Although most of the cells of the blastocyst are at the periphery, a few of the cells are trapped inside, adhering to one of the poles of this hollow ball of cells. These trapped cells are the embryoblasts , whereas the peripherally positioned cells are the trophoblasts. The embryoblasts will give rise to the embryo whereas the trophoblasts are responsible for the formation of the embryonic portion of the placenta."
"The cells of embryoblasts rearrange themselves to form two layers, the epiblasts and the hypoblasts, and the embryo becomes known as the bilaminar germ disc. The epiblast is closer to the trophoblast cells than is the hypoblast, and the forming embryo is about 7–8 days old . By this time it has reached the uterine cavity, where it burrows into the wall of the uterus."
"This process of implantation begins on the late sixth or early seventh day after fertilization and is completed on the eleventh day. During the period of implantation some of the cells of the epiblast delaminate, forming a membrane over the remaining epiblast. This new layer of cells is composed of the amnioblasts, which will give rise to the amniotic sac, and the space between the amnioblasts and the epiblasts is known as the amniotic cavity."
"At about the fourteenth day post fertilization, at the anterior end of the bilaminar germ disc, a few cells of the epiblasts form desmosomal contacts with a few cells of the underlying hypoblast, thus forming the prochordal plate, which will be the future buccopharyngeal membrane. Approximately 1 day later a longitudinal furrow, the primitive groove, develops in the epiblast on the posterior aspect of the bilaminar germ disc, the anteriormost extent of which is deeper, and is referred to as the primitive pit. Bordering both sides of the primitive groove is an elevation of cells, the primitive streak, whereas the anterior border of the primitive pit is a small elevation of cells, the primitive node ."
"Cells of the epiblast undergo active mitosis along most of its surface and the newly formed cells migrate to the primitive streak. Here they enter the primitive groove and pass into the space between the epiblasts and the hypoblast, thus forming a new, intermediate layer of cells, the mesoderm. Some of these cells do not stop in the mesoderm space, but displace most of the original cells of the hypoblast, pushing the original cells of the hypoblast laterally."
"The cells of the hypoblast become incorporated into an extraembryonic region, known as the yolk sac. As this process is occurring, the epiblast is renamed the ectoderm and the new cell layer that replaces the hypoblasts is referred to as the endoderm. Thus, as a result of the conversion of the embryoblast of the blastocyst into the trilaminar germ disc, a process known as gastrulation, the embryo is composed of three layers , and is known as the trilaminar germ disc ."
"The entire embryo, at this time, is approximately 1 mm in length. Cells of the mesoderm cannot penetrate the contact of the ectoderm and endoderm at the prochordal plate, but they can migrate around this region of adhesion, and some mesoderm cells will be located anterior to this structure. These cells are cardiogenic cells, and begin to form the future heart."
"An additional group of cells migrate from the primitive node into the primitive pit and proceed anteriorly, en masse, between the ectoderm and the endoderm until they reach the prochordal plate, where their progress is blocked. This pencil-shaped column of cells is known as the notochordal process, and it possesses special inductive capabilities. The notochord induces the cells of the ectoderm lying above it to proliferate and form the flat neural plate, the beginning of the primitive nervous system of the embryo."
"Since, at this time the primitive nervous system is on the external aspect of the body, it has to be internalized. The process of internalization, known as neurulation, is accomplished by an alteration in cell shape and by increased mitotic activity, especially of the lateral edges of the neural plate. These activities begin to fold the neural plate into a longitudinal furrow, the neural groove, whose two walls are the neural folds."
"Further cell division and continued change in cell morphology cause the neural folds of the two sides to approximate and fuse with each other in the midline, forming the neural tube . The process of fusion starts at the midcervical level and proceeds anteriorly  and posteriorly  and is completed by the end of the fourth week of gestation. The final regions of the neural tube to be closed are the anterior and posterior neuropores."
"The cells of the neural tube just above the notochord differentiate to form the floor plate. These cells induce the differentiation of neuroblasts into motoneurons and establish the polarity of the neural tube Fusion of the lateral edges of the right and left sides of the central nervous system  is accompanied by fusion of the ectoderm, whose edges became approximated during neural tube formation. The simultaneous fusions permit a separation of the neural tube from the overlying ectoderm, and complete internalization of the nervous system."
"Incomplete fusion results in a relatively common developmental anomaly known as spina bifida. The nervous system, including the organs of special senses, originate from three sources: the neural tube ; the neural crest ; and the ectodermal placodes . As the edges of the neural folds meet each other, some of their cells do not participate in the formation of the neural tube, instead they form a narrow strip of cells, the neural crest ."
"The cells of the neural crest will migrate throughout the body to form almost the entire peripheral nervous system, including the enteric nervous system, dorsal root ganglia, sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves, all postganglionic autonomic neurons, as well as melanocytes, parenchymal cells of the suprarenal medulla , Schwann cells and satellite cells of the peripheral nervous system, and most of the mesenchymal cells of the head and anterior neck. Therefore, most of the mesenchymal cells of this region are not derived from mesoderm, instead they are neuroectodermal in origin and are referred to as ectomesenchyme. Derivatives of the neural crest, neural plate, and ectodermal placodes are summarized in Table 2."
"1. The cells of the neural crest follow four general pathways marked by signaling molecules manufactured and released by neighboring cells. Examples of these molecules are retinoic acid, transforming growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor."
"These signaling molecules contact cell surface receptors of target cells, activating intracellular molecular systems that cause specific responses within those cells. Some of these responses activate cytoplasmic enzyme systems, whereas other responses include the activation of transcription factors that regulate specific gene expressions, each resulting in the activation of specific inductive processes necessary for the formation of the nervous system. The mesoderm lying lateral to the neural tube and notochord in the region of the future trunk is known as the paraxial mesoderm, and it becomes segmented into paired blocks of tissue, known as somites ."
"Each somite is composed of three elements. These are the sclerotome, responsible for the formation of two succeeding vertebrae and their intervening intervertebral disc; myotome, responsible for the formation of the muscle masses associated with that segment of the trunk; and dermatome, responsible for the formation of the dermis of the skin in its particular area of the trunk. The region of the paraxial mesoderm lateral to the somites is known as the intermediate mesoderm and it forms the urogenital system."
"The most lateral aspect of the paraxial mesoderm, known as the lateral plate mesoderm, splits into wo sheaths and the intervening space between these two sheaths is known as the coelom, or body cavity . The dorsal of the two sheaths of the lateral plate mesoderm becomes known as the somatic mesoderm, and together with its associated ectoderm this is referred to as the somatopleure. The ventral sheath is known as the splanchnic mesoderm and, together with its associated endoderm, is referred to as the splanchnopleure."
"The somatopleure gives rise to the body wall whereas the splanchnopleure forms the wall of the gut. The coelom becomes subdivided into the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. Segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm of the head is incomplete and, instead of forming somites, it is said to form about 18–20 pairs of somitomeres, somite-like structures that are responsible for the formation of the muscles of the head."
"The anteriormost seven pairs of somitomeres remain as unsegmented structures, whereas the posterior somitomeres become transformed into somites. As the neural tube becomes internalized, its anterior region, the future brain— whose development is detailed below—is developing so rapidly that it grows above and anterior to the prochordal plate, it overlies the cardiogenic region, and approximates the amniotic sac. The anterior end of the embryo, possibly to provide more room for growth, begins to bend in an inferior direction ."
"As that occurs, the future heart becomes neatly tucked beneath the embryo, and the prochordal plate, now referred to as the buccopharyngeal membrane, becomes positioned superiorly to the developing heart, separating the stomadeum, the primitive oral cavity, from the developing foregut . Note that the stomadeum is in fact a space captured by the embryo from the amniotic cavity. The formation of the stomadeum is indicative of the initiation of the development of the face."
"As the buccopharyngeal membrane degenerates during the fifth week of development and communication is established between the future oral cavity and the pharynx, the stomadeum deepens and begins to be surrounded by ectodermal-covered mesenchymal thickenings, the pharyngeal arches . These bilaterally positioned arches develop in an anteroposterior direction. The first arch is the mandibular arch, the second is the hyoid arch, whereas successive arches are numbered 3, 4, and 6, with the notable absence of the fifth pharyngeal arch, which in humans is rudimentary."
"Between neighboring arches an external depression—the ectodermally lined pharyngeal groove—is encountered, with its anatomical counterpart on the inside, the pharyngeal pouch, an evagination of the endodermally lined pharynx. The connective tissue elements of the pharyngeal arches, especially those associated with the developing musculature, arise from somitomere mesoderm, whereas the majority of the mesenchyme, particularly in the anterior regions of the arches, arise from neural crest material. These neural crestderived cells arise from the midbrain and the rhombomeres and, during early pharyngeal arch formation, express homeobox gene products  that reflect their sites of neural origin."
"Each pharyngeal arch possesses its own cartilage, nerve, vascular, and muscular components. The first two arches become developed to the greatest extent, whereas the last one is the most poorly developed. Only some of their derivatives will be discussed."
"The cartilage of the first  arch is a horseshoeshaped structure, known as Meckel’s cartilage. Most of this cartilage will disappear, except for its anteriormost extent which participates in the formation of the mental symphysis and its posteriormost extent which gives rise to the malleus and incus, two of the three ossicles of the ear. The perichondrium of Meckel’s cartilage becomes the sphenomandibular ligament and the anterior ligament of the malleus."
"The ectomesenchyme of the first pharyngeal arch forms the muscles of mastication , as well as the following muscles: the tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, anterior belly of the digastric, and mylohyoid. Since these muscles are derived from the mandibular arch, they are innervated by the nerve of this arch, the trigeminal nerve . The mandibular arch, as will be evident later in this chapter, is responsible for the formation of much of the face."
"The development of the mandibular arch is dependent on the presence of the epidermally derived signaling molecule, endothelin-1 . This molecule probably functions in the facilitation of the interaction between the ectomesenchymal cells and the epithelial components of the arch, a process necessary for the development of structures that originate in the mandibular arch. The cartilage of the second or hyoid arch is known as Reichert’s cartilage."
"Most of this cartilage will also disappear, but parts of it will be responsible for the formation of the stapes, the third ossicle of the ear, as well as the styloid process, and the lesser cornu and superior aspect of the body of the hyoid bone. Additionally, the stylohyoid ligament is derived from the perichondrium of Reichert’s cartilage. The muscles of facial expression take their origin in the hyoid arch mesoderm, along with the stapedius, stylohyoid, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscles."
"All of the above muscles are, therefore, innervated by the nerve of the second arch, the facial nerve . The homeobox gene Hoxa-2 is responsible for the normal development of the hyoid arch and its derivatives. In the absence of Hoxa-2 the formation of second arch derivatives does not occur, instead first arch derivatives develop in the hyoid arch."
"The implication of this switch is that mandibular arch substances form by default and Hoxa-2 gene products prevent the default condition from taking place. The cartilage of the third arch is unnamed, but it is responsible for the formation of the greater horn and the inferior half of the body of the hyoid bone. The only muscle to be derived from the mesoderm of the third arch is the stylopharyngeus muscle, innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve , the nerve of the third arch."
The cartilages of the fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches are also unnamed. They participate in the formation of the skeleton of the larynx. It is believed that the muscles associated with the larynx and pharynx are derived from the mesenchyme of these arches.
"The innervation of these muscles is somewhat confusing, for they receive their nerve supply from the pharyngeal plexus . The nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, however, are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve , respectively. Only the first pharyngeal groove, that between the mandibular and hyoid arches, gives rise to a definitive structure."
"This groove becomes deeper and approximates the first pharyngeal pouch, so much so, that only a thin membrane, the pharyngeal membrane , separates the groove from the pouch. This closing plate becomes the tympanic membrane whose external surface is covered by the ectodermal derivative of the first pharyngeal groove. The remainder of the first pharyngeal groove becomes the external auditory canal."
"The subsequent pharyngeal grooves are submerged by the sudden spurt of growth experienced by the second pharyngeal arch, which grows in an inferior direction, to form the future neck. Occasionally, the submerged pharyngeal grooves do not become obliterated, and thus remain as cervical sinuses, which may result in the formation of cervical cysts. The message for this sudden growth spurt arises from the epithelium covering the tip of the second arch."
"These ectodermal cells express BMP-7, sonic hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor 8, which are responsible for the proliferation of the mesenchymal cells of the hyoid arch. The first pharyngeal pouch, lying between the mandibular and hyoid arches, forms the Eustachian tube, the tympanic cavity, and the endodermal lining of the eardrum. The second pharyngeal pouch forms the palatine tonsils."
"The third pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the thymus and the inferior parathyroid glands. The fourth pharyngeal pouch forms the superior parathyroid gland, and perhaps part of the thymus, and the fifth pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Development of the embryo requires a blueprint of spatial phenomena that occur at specific, predetermined periods of time, a process referred to as patterning."
"This blueprint is located in the nucleus of each cell, present in the chromosomes as a group of related genes. Various intra- and extracellular parameters cause the activation or suppression of these genes and in this fashion facilitate the normal sequence of growth and development. Genes code for the synthesis of specific proteins, many of which are enzymes that are responsible for the occurrence of specific events."
"Certain genes have been conserved through evolution and their study in lower organisms, such as the fruitfly, has provided information that is directly applicable to the developmental processes of higher organisms, including humans. A family of genes, known as the homeobox genes, code for the synthesis of transcription factors, proteins that bind to and regulate the expression of other genes. The time sequence of the events controlled by products of these homeobox genes and by growth factors are essential for normal development because certain genes can be switched on only if some other genes have already been activated and if still other genes have not as yet been switched on."
"In other words, there are “windows of opportunity” for the occurrence of certain events and if that timeframe is missed then development will not proceed normally. Therefore, these homeobox genes become activated in a specific order, and their sequential expression establishes a pattern of developmental events. In order for development to progress in a normal manner, cells must interact with each other."
"These interactions may involve the physical contact of two cells or the release of a particular substance by one cell, referred to as the signaling cell, to act as a message for the other cell, known as the target cell. The substance that is released is known by various names, such as signaling molecule, growth factor, or ligand, and it reaches its target cell by traveling in the body fluids. Since the signaling molecule may meet a number of other cells, it is important that only the target cells become influenced by that particular molecule and this process is ensured by the presence of receptor molecules on the surfaces of cells."
"Usually, a specific receptor molecule recognizes only a particular signaling molecule. This is similar to a lock and key concept, where a specific lock can be opened only by a particular key. If physical contact between cells is required, it is important that the two cells recognize each other."
"Cell recognition is also a function of a series of cell surface receptor molecules, some of which act as the keys and the others as locks. Usually several molecules are involved on each cell so as to ensure that only the intended target cell is influenced by the signaling cell. Once the cell surface receptors come into contact with and bind the signaling molecule, or come into contact with the molecules on the signaling cell’s surface, a sequence of intracellular events is initiated resulting in the regulation of a single gene or a series of genes of the target cell."
"The expression of these genes may cause the release of further signaling molecules, may alter the activities of the target cell, may prompt the target cell to differentiate into another cell type, may compel the cell to proliferate, or may direct the cell to undergo apoptosis and die. Each of these events is necessary for normal development to occur. The process whereby one cell causes its target cell to differentiate, that is become transformed into a different cell type, is known as induction."
"It is interesting to note that the number of growth factors that regulate development are relatively small. The reason for the paucity of their number is that they act in combination with each other, and by simple permutations and combinations of just a few of these factors a tremendous number of signals may be generated. Initially, the neural tube is composed of a single layer of columnar cells, known as neuroepithelial cells."
"Proliferation of these cells results in a thickened tubular structure whose cephalic region begins to form three enlargements: the prosencephalon , mesencephalon , and rhombencephalon . The caudal extent of the neural tube forms the spinal cord. As the three vesicles are developing, the cephalic flexure in the region of the mesencephalon and the cervical flexure, between the rhombencephalon and the future spinal cord, are also forming."
"By the fifth week of gestation the prosencephalon is divided into two regions: the telencephalon with its two lateral swellings, the future cerebral hemispheres, and the diencephalon, whose optic vesicles are in the process of development. The rhombencephalon is also subdivided, by the pontine flexure, into two regions: the metencephalon, which will form the pons and the cerebellum, and the myelencephalon, which will develop into the medulla oblongata. These flexures provide increased space for the folding and three-dimensional organization of the brain."
"The lumen of the developing CNS is subdivided into the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. The lateral ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres communicate with the third ventricle of the diencephalon via the interventricular foramina . The fourth ventricle, located in the rhombencephalon, communicates with the third ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct  located in the mesencephalon."
"As the neuroepithelial cells continue to proliferate, they establish a thicker wall composed of a pseudostratified epithelium, each of whose cells initially extends the entire thickness of the developing neural tube. As development progresses, some of these neuroepithelial cells remain adjacent to the lumen, whereas most cells migrate away from it, resulting in a three-layered neural tube. The layer adjacent to the lumen is known as the ventricular zone , some of whose cells develop into ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord."
"The middle region of the developing neural tube is the mantle layer . The third layer of the developing neural tube, located the farthest from the lumen is the marginal layer . Since these neuroepithelial cells are quite long, initially they extend from the lumen of the neural tube to its periphery, spanning all three layers."
"Hence one may name regions of these cells according to the zone in which they are located. When a neuroepithelial cell is ready to undergo mitosis its nucleus migrates from the ventricular zone to the region of the cell occupying the marginal layer and the cell enters the S phase  of the cell cycle. Upon completion of the S phase, the nucleus returns to the ventricular zone, and the cell shortens and becomes round so that the cell is located completely in the ventricular zone."
"It is here that the cell divides to give rise to two daughter cells, which may remain in the ventricular zone or migrate to the mantle layer or into the marginal layer . There appear to be at least two types of neuroepithelial cells: those that can be stained for glial fibrillary acidic  proteins  and those that lack GFA proteins . GFA-negative cells give rise to an enormous number of daughter cells that eventually differentiate into migratory neuroblasts that are no longer able to divide."
GFA-positive cells also give rise to an immense number of daughter cells that will differentiate into glioblasts and ependymal cells. Neuroblasts arise first and glioblasts and ependymal cells originate later. Neuroblasts migrate from the ventricular zone into the mantle layer where they differentiate into neurons.
"Glioblasts give rise to all macroglia , and ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. As the neuroblasts are differentiating into neurons within the mantle layer they develop axons that grow into the marginal layer. Concomitantly, many glioblasts will migrate into the marginal layer, and those that become oligodendroglia form a protective cellular sheath around the developing axons, dendrites, and cell bodies within the mantle layer."
"Many of the axons will become myelinated by the oligodendroglia. Thus, in the spinal cord, the mantle layer is the future gray matter, whereas the marginal layer, composed of numerous myelinated axons and attendant neuroglia, becomes the white matter. Myelination in the CNS begins around the sixteenth week of gestation and continues until the individual is about 3 years old, although recently it has been shown that in the frontal lobes of the brain this process may continue into the early twenties."
"It is interesting to note that there is a phylogenetic component to the sequence of myelination, in that the older pathways are myelinated before newer pathways; also motor roots of spinal nerves are myelinated before sensory roots. The mantle layer increases in thickness in a disproportionate fashion, causing a ventral and dorsal thickening  of the entire length of the wall of the future spinal cord. These two thickenings are separated from each other by a longitudinal furrow, known as the sulcus limitans."
"The neuroblasts of the basal plate differentiate into motoneurons, responsible for the motor function of the spinal cord , whereas neuroblasts of the alar plate differentiate into interneurons. Some of these interneurons will receive sensory information from primary sensory neurons . In the thoracic and upper lumbar regions  of the future spinal cord an intermediate thickening is discerned."
"Neuroblasts of this region will give rise to preganglionic sympathetic neurons  of the autonomic nervous system. It should be noted that various synonyms are in common use among neuroanatomists and some of these are given at the end of the chapter. The central midline of the floor  and roof  of the neural tube has few, if any, neuroblasts, and is devoid of nerve cell bodies."
"However, neuronal processes will be present in these regions, conveying information between the two halves of the spinal cord. Neurons of the dorsal root ganglia arise from cells of the neural crest. These neurons are responsible for delivering information from the sensory receptor organs to the spinal cord for processing."
"Neuroblasts, which begin their differentiation as relatively spherical cells, form two processes at opposite poles. Usually, one of the processes, the dendrite, begins to arborize, whereas the other process, the axon, remains unbranched. The manner in which the axon and dendrite are established and modified, permits neurons to be classified as unipolar , bipolar, and multipolar ."
"Unipolar  neurons are located in sensory ganglia. The two processes of each of these cells begin to grow toward and fuse with one another, forming a single process. This unified process then divides into two processes that grow in opposing directions."
"One of the processes, the central process, enters the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it may terminate or ascend to higher levels. Collections of central processes form the dorsal roots of the spinal nerve. Collections of peripheral processes join the ventral root fibers to form the spinal nerve."
"Bipolar neurons retain their two processes at opposing poles of the cell body. Dendrites of these cells collect information from the periphery of the body, whereas their axons deliver information to the CNS for processing. Bipolar neurons are associated only with the olfactory epithelium, cerebral cortex, retina, cochlear nucleus, and the vestibular nucleus."
"Multipolar neurons instead of having only two processes, develop several. One of these is the axon, whereas the remainder are dendrites. Collections of axons of multipolar neurons of the basal plate grow through the marginal zone to form the ventral root of the spinal cord."
"As mentioned above, they join with collections of peripheral processes of unipolar neurons of the dorsal root ganglia to form the spinal nerve. As neuroblasts of the basal plate differentiate they become multipolar neurons whose axons grow not only into but through the marginal layer and pierce the external boundary of the neural tube. Collections of these axons travel together forming the ventral rootlets of the spinal cord."
"These ventral rootlets join others in their vicinity to form the ventral root of a spinal nerve. At the same time, central processes of the unipolar neurons of the dorsal root ganglia pierce the external aspect of the neural tube at the dorsolateral sulcus, and enter the marginal zone or the alar plate. Central processes that enter the alar plate form synapses with the interneurons whose axons form synaptic contacts with motoneurons of the basal plate, and in this fashion form simple reflex arcs."
Those that enter only the marginal layer travel to higher levels in the CNS. Many of these central processes travel en masse to reach their specific destinations. Collections of fibers going to the same destination are named accordingly.
"As described above, collections of the peripheral processes of unipolar neurons join the ventral roots to form the mixed  spinal nerves. Motor nerves effect muscle contraction or glandular secretion, whereas sensory nerves transmit information from outside or inside the body. Motor nerves propagate information that goes away from the CNS to a muscle  and are called efferent nerve fibers."
"Sensory nerves propagate information toward the CNS and are called afferent nerve fibers. Motor fibers of spinal nerves that innervate skeletal muscle are said to be general somatic efferent  fibers, whereas motor fibers that innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands are said to be general visceral efferent  fibers. Sensory fibers that bring information from the skin, skeletal muscle, tendons, and joints are called general somatic afferent  fibers, whereas those that bring information from the viscera  are named general visceral afferent  fibers."
"The visceral components  belong to the autonomic nervous system ; however, GVA fibers are not autonomic fibers. A typical spinal nerve has all of these four functional components . These modalities develop in specific regions along the alar and basal plates of the spinal cord, forming columns of recognizable gray matter along the length of the spinal cord, known as the GSA, GVA, GVE, and GSE columns."
"It should be noted that GVE columns are present only in the thoracic, upper lumbar , and sacral levels . The regions of the GSE column responsible for motor innervation of the upper and lower extremities are quite extensive and are, therefore, divided into larger medial and smaller lateral motor columns. The medial motor columns are responsible for supplying the axial muscles, whereas the lateral columns serve the extremities."
"Similarly, in the alar compartment, the regions that receive information from the extremities are larger than the remaining areas. It should be noted that cranial nerves carry additional modalities that are discussed below. As discussed above, during early embryogenesis, clusters of cells, known as somites, form on either side of the developing spinal cord."
"These somites form the skeletal muscles, skin , and connective tissue of the body. Skin and skeletal muscle derived from a particular somite are innervated by neurons arising from the segment of the spinal cord  in its vicinity, giving rise to segmental innervation of the embryo that is conserved in the adult. Since, in the early embryo, the length of the vertebral canal equals the length of the spinal cord, the segment of the spinal cord is at the same level as the body segment."
"However, since growth in body length surpasses the lengthening of the spinal cord, in the adult the spinal cord is much shorter than the vertebral canal and thus , the body segment innervated lies farther away than it does in the embryo. The region of the vertebral canal that is devoid of spinal cord in the adult is occupied by the accumulation of dorsal and ventral rootlets, collectively known as the cauda equina . The space occupied by these structures is an enlarged subarachnoid space, known as the lumbar cistern."
"During early development the primary brain divisions —the rhombencephalon, mesencephalon, and prosencephalon —were established, as were the three flexures, the cephalic, cervical, and pontine flexures. Since the development of the rhombencephalon is similar to that of the spinal cord discussed above, the embryology of the brain will be detailed in the reverse order to permit a more logical approach to its study. Table 2."
"4 summarizes the adult structures derived from the three primary divisions . The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata, the rostral continuation of the spinal cord. During the development of the myelencephalon, the pontine flexure arises, and appears to stretch the roof plate, which becomes a thin epithelial layer."
"The alar plates of the two sides move farther away from one another, and the intervening cavity of the hindbrain becomes the caudal aspect of the fourth ventricle . The junction between the dorsal edge of the alar plates and the roof plate is known as the rhombic lip, composed of an inferior and a superior rhombic lip . Nuclei of cranial nerves VIII through XII as well as part of the nucleus of the trigeminal nerve  are formed from the alar  and basal plates ."
"Also, neuroblasts from the alar plate migrate ventrally to become the neurons constituting the inferior olivary nuclei . Subsequent to the establishment of the nuclei fiber tracts will appear, the most pronounced of which are the pyramids. The nuclei of cranial nerves VI and VII as well as the remaining portion of cranial nerve V arise from the alar and basal plates of the metencephalon."
"Moreover, two important, large structures develop from cells migrating from the alar plates of the metencephalon. One group of cells migrates ventrally to form the pontine nuclei, whereas the other group migrates to the superior rhombic lip to form the cerebellum. Three groups of motoneurons develop from the basal plates of the metencephalon: the somatic efferent , general visceral efferent , and special visceral efferent ."
"Three groups of sensory nuclei develop from the alar plates of the metencephalon: the somatic afferent , general visceral afferent, and special visceral afferent. As neurons of the alar plate undergo intense mitotic activity, their proliferation causes an expansion of each rhombic lip . As the inferior aspect of the rhombic lip forms a bulge in the wall of the fourth ventricle its superior aspect increases greatly in size, and these two thickenings are known as the cerebellar plates ."
"The cerebellar plates of the right and left side grow toward each other and fuse in the midline, each half forming the future cerebellar hemispheres. The inferior aspect of the cerebellar plates will become greatly reduced in size and remain as the roof over the ventricle; in the adult it forms the vermis. During the process of cerebellar formation, neuroblasts enter the marginal layer and form the cerebellar cortex."
"The huge number of cells that are being formed cause folding of the cortex into leaf-like structures called folia. Neuroblasts that remain in the mantle layer of the forming cerebellum also proliferate to form the dentate and deep cerebellar nuclei. Axons to and from the cerebellar cortex form very large tracts, such as the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and the corticopontocerebellar pathway."
"The mesencephalon is situated rostral to the pons and is the region of the midbrain flexure. Its wall becomes quite thick, obliterating much of the central lumen, which becomes a narrow cleft—the cerebral aqueduct  connecting the third and fourth ventricles. The alar plates give rise to the tectum, composed of the superior and inferior colliculi, which are reflex centers for visual and auditory signals, respectively."
"Additionally, the alar plate is believed to give rise to the periaqueductal gray. The basal plate is responsible for the formation of the tegmentum, whose red nucleus and substantia nigra, along with the nuclei of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, arise from its neuroblasts. With continued development of the cerebral cortex the ventral aspect of the mesencephalon thickens considerably, forming the cerebral peduncles, fiber tracts leading to and from the cerebral cortex."
"The prosencephalon is the forebrain and is divided into two regions, the diencephalon and the prosencephalon. The three regions of the diencephalon—the epithalamus, thalamus, and hypothalamus—form as three separate bulges in the walls of the third ventricle. The habenular nuclei and the pineal body form the epithalamus."
"The largest portion of the diencephalon, the thalamus, is separated from the underlying hypothalamus by the hypothalamic sulcus, a transverse groove in the wall of the third ventricle. The close functional association of the thalamus with the cerebral cortex necessitates a synchronous developmental association between these two structures. As nuclei within the thalamus  increase in size, they bulge into the third ventricle, decreasing its size."
"Frequently, the nuclei of the right and left thalami fuse at a small region across the third ventricle, forming the massa intermedia. Nuclei within the hypothalamus form ventral to the hypothalamic sulcus. These nuclei will be responsible for monitoring and controlling various endocrine and autonomic functions."
"Additionally, a ventral evagination of the hypothalamus is responsible for the formation of the median eminence and the infundibulum . As the diencephalon develops, the roof of the third ventricle becomes extremely thin, so that it is formed only of a layer of ependymal cells and the vascular pia mater. This vascular roof invaginates into the third ventricle, forming the choroid plexus."
"Although choroid plexuses develop in all of the ventricles of the brain, their developmental process is identical to that occurring in the third ventricle and is not treated again during the discussions of the other ventricles. Concomitant with the development of this choroid plexus, three bulges become evident on the floor of the third ventricle, and these form the mammillary bodies, the infundibulum, and the optic chiasma. The infundibulum of the diencephalon is a downward evagination of the floor of the third ventricle."
"As the infundibulum grows down, it meets an ectodermal diverticulum of the oral cavity, known as Rathke’s pouch. These two structures fuse with each other to form the pituitary gland . The neurohypophysis  arises from the infundibulum, whereas the adenohypophysis  derives from Rathke’s pouch ."
"A small colloid-filled cleft frequently remains as a vestige of the lumen of Rathke’s pouch, in the pars intermedia. During the third week of gestation, the ventrolateral wall on each side of the future diencephalon gives rise to an optic vesicle. These hollow vesicles grow in a lateral direction, reach the basal lamina of the head ectoderm, and induce the ectoderm to form the lens placode, the precursor of the lens of the eye."
"The optic vesicle invaginates to form a two-layered structure, known as the optic cup, which gives rise to the nervous and pigmented layers of the retina; the connection between the optic cup and the forming brain becomes known as the optic stalk . As axons growing out of the developing retina increase the thickness of the wall of the optic stalk, its lumen becomes obliterated, and the optic stalk becomes known as the optic nerve. The optic nerves of the right and left sides join in the midline to form the optic chiasma, where axons arising from the medial half of each retina cross over to the opposite side."
"As the rim of the optic cup, in contact with the lens placode, encircles the prospective lens to form the iris, a slight cleft  remains, permitting the future central artery and vein of the retina access to the retina. The rostral extent of the neural tube is the telencephalon, which extends from the diencephalon to the lamina terminalis, the anteriormost boundary of the neural tube. The telencephalon undergoes a tremendous growth spur, forming the two telencephalic vesicles that will overgrow much of the brain by developing into the two cerebral hemispheres."
"The lumina of the telencephalic vesicles remain as the large, cerebrospinal fluid-filled lateral ventricles. These two ventricles will communicate with each other as well as with the third ventricle via the interventricular foramen . Growth of the telencephalic vesicles is asymmetric, in that the lateral expansion, forming the prospective insula, enlarges less than do the dorsal, posterior, and medial regions."
"In fact, some of these regions overgrow and cover the insula and, in the adult, they are named the temporal, frontal, and frontoparietal opercula. The anterior expansion is also slight, forming the future olfactory bulb. Continued growth of the telencephalic vesicles within the limited space of the cranial cavity is responsible for the folding of the developing cerebral cortex into elevations called gyri and intervening grooves, known as sulci."
"Some of the deeper grooves are named fissures; these separate lobes of the cerebral hemispheres from each other. Major fiber tracts—the optic chiasma, anterior commissure, and the corpus callosum—develop in the region of the lamina terminalis. These fiber tracts connect similar areas of the right and left cerebral hemispheres to each other."
"The superior aspect of the telencephalic vesicle, known as the pallium, is responsible for the formation of the cerebral cortex, a thin layer of gray matter covering the great mass of white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Neuroblasts of the inferior aspect of the telencephalic vesicles undergo intense mitotic activity, forming a highly cellular region. Due to the large number of axons that pass through this cell-rich area, connecting the cerebral cortex to other regions of the brain and to the spinal cord, this area appears striated and is thus referred to as the corpus striatum."
"Many of these fibers join to form a major fiber tract, the internal capsule, that will isolate clusters of cells of the corpus striatum from each other; these cell clusters develop into the lentiform nucleus  and the caudate nucleus. The most common defect of the neural tube is incomplete fusion of the neural groove, resulting in spina bifida cystica. This involves a protrusion of the spinal cord tissue through a bony defect, so that a portion of the nervous tissue is visible on the individual’s back as a cyst-like structure."
"There are various degrees of spina bifida, the worst of which involves mental retardation as well as paralysis below the level of the lesion. Although the cause of this anomaly is not known, there are several agents, such as an excess maternal intake of vitamin A and hyperthermia, that increase its incidence. Newer diagnostic methods, such as ultrasound examination during the eleventh and subsequent weeks of gestation, as well as measuring a-fetoprotein levels in the amniotic fluid, can indicate and detect the presence of spina bifida cystica."
"Spinal dermal sinus is a condition that frequently displays the presence of a slight depression, similar to a dimple, in the midline of the sacral region of the back. This slight depression is indicative of the final fusion of the sacral spinal cord level, where the separation of the neural tube from the surface ectoderm was almost incomplete. In fact, occasionally a fibrous cord persists between the dura mater and the dermis just beneath the dimple."
"Hydrocephalus is a condition where the ventricles of the brain or the subarachnoid spaces  accumulate an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid . In the neonate this is most frequently a result of occlusion of the cerebral aqueduct that hinders the flow of CSF from the third into the fourth ventricle. In very extensive cases, the continued manufacture of CSF by the choroid plexuses of the two lateral and third ventricles increases the fluid volume of the ventricles, resulting in enlargement of the head, reduction in the thickness of the bones of the cranium, and compression of the walls of the ventricles."
"Such compression may cause lamination of the cerebral cortex resulting in severe mental retardation. A type of hydrocephalus, known as communicating hydrocephalus, is caused by the Arnold–Chiari malformation. This anomalous condition is characterized by herniation of the cerebellum and medulla into the foramen magnum, which impedes absorption of CSF, leading to the expansion of the ventricles with subsequent enlargement of the head."
"Arnold–Chiari malformation usually accompanies severe cases of spina bifida. Anencephalus is due to the lack of fusion of the anterior neural groove. It is thus similar to spina bifida, in that the nervous tissue  is open to the environment rather than being enclosed in the bony cranium."
"Usually the nervous tissue is directly continuous with the skin of the scalp. Frequently vascular agenesis accompanies this condition and much of the forming brain becomes necrotic a few weeks prior to birth. Microcephaly is a condition with varied causes, such as maternal pelvic X-irradiation, a recessive genetic trait, or infection of the fetus with toxoplasmosis."
"As the name implies, microcephaly is characterized by a small head and small brain. The cerebral cortex is usually hypocellular with a resultant mental retardation and predisposition to motor disorders and seizures. Agyri  is characterized by the absence of fissures and sulci and an indiscriminate arrangement of neurons."
"This occurs as a result of decreased cellular activity and a consequent diminishing of brain growth. Corpus callosum agenesis, an infrequent but interesting condition, is characterized by the absence of the corpus callosum, the major communicating pathway between the two cerebral hemispheres. Occasionally the condition is asymptomatic and individuals may be of average IQ."
"Frequently, however, mental deficiency and the occurrence of tremors and seizures are present. Holoprosencephaly, defective development of the prosencephalon, may be of varying severity, extending from major malformation of the calvaria, forebrain, and midfacial skeleton to minor malformations involving these regions. The primary etiology of this condition is the consumption of alcohol during the first month or so of pregnancy."
"It should be stressed that even small quantities of alcohol consumed during this time and even a single instance of “binge” drinking may cause severe retardation and deformations of the midface. The association of alcohol consumption and holoprosencephaly is also referred to as the fetal alcohol syndrome. This newborn has a myelomeningocele, generically known as spina bifida."
"A myelomeningocele is one of the disorders in a group of conditions known as neural tube defects, otherwise known as dysraphism. A neural tube defect can occur along any part of the developing CNS. When it affects the region that should eventually become the brain it is known as anencephaly, meaning the brain is literally absent."
"However, it most commonly affects the most caudal portion and becomes know as spina bifida. There is failure of closure and neurulation of the neural tube. This occurs during the first few weeks of gestation."
"Spina bifida cystica refers to an open spinal defect where nervous tissue and/or meninges protrude from a defect in the vertebral column and are exposed to the outside environment on the surface of the back. A myelomeningocele is an open defect where the spinal cord and meninges are exposed and often form a tumor-like mass in the midline just above the buttock. Spina bifida occulta refers to a closed spinal defect where skin covers the defect, and the spinal cord and meninges are within the defective vertebral column."
"A closed spinal defect is obviously milder than an open one. An overlying cutaneous abnormality, such as a tuft of hair or hemangioma, or a subcutaneous lipoma  may betray an underlying closed spinal defect. Both give rise to neurologic deficits, though those with open spinal defects are already present at birth and tend to be severe."
"Neurologic deficits such as leg weakness, sensory deficits in the legs, and urinary incontinence can occur much later in a closed spinal defect. This can present any time from early childhood to adulthood. It often occurs secondary to a tethered cord syndrome ."
A myelomeningocele needs to be surgically repaired within 48 hours of birth. The mortality rate from infection or other complications would otherwise be near 100%. A downward herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum is always present .
"Hydrocephalus may also be present and both of these conditions may require surgery. Orthopedic malformations of the hip and/or feet often occur and may need to be corrected surgically. Folic acid supplement very early in pregnancy decreases the incidence of neural tube defects, although the reason is unclear."
"The incidence is decreasing in the Western world, though it is still a common fetal malformation. A 32-year-old man complains of numbness and tingling in his left arm which began 5 days ago. He has also noted some recent “staggering” when walking and he feels quite off balance."
There is no dizziness or weakness. He knows of no precipitating event. He has no other complaints.
"Upon asking about past history, he recalls that about 3 years ago he had an episode of bilateral leg paralysis and poor sensation in the legs. This improved over the course of 2 months and his legs got back to normal. No specific etiology was found at that time."
"He has not followed up with a doctor. Examination shows sensory loss and altered sensation to stimulation in the left distal upper extremity and hand. Finger movements in both hands show poor coordination, somewhat more so on the left, but there is no weakness found in the face, arms, or legs."
"Gait is mildly ataxic. He cannot walk heel to toe in a straight line. Reflexes in the arms are normal, and are brisk at the knees and ankles but not necessarily pathologically so."
"Neurologic exam is otherwise unremarkable. Aside from the meninges, vascular supply, and minor connective tissue elements, the central nervous system  is composed only of cells. These are categorized into two types: neurons, which receive and transmit impulses, and neuroglia, which support and facilitate the proper functioning of the neurons."
"A collection of neurons within the CNS is referred to as a nucleus , whereas a collection of neurons in the peripheral nervous system  is known as a ganglion. Neurons form reflex arcs, where information from the periphery is carried by a sensory neuron to the CNS, and is directly transmitted to a motoneuron for a motor response. This is the simplest reflex arc because it involves only two neurons."
"An example of a two cell reflex arc is the patellar reflex . Most reflex arcs are three or more cell reflex arcs, since they include a third neuron, the interneuron, interposed between the sensory neuron and the motoneuron. The reflex response associated with a three cell reflex may be overridden when the interneuron receives an input from higher centers of the brain that prevent it from transmitting the information from the sensory neuron to the motoneuron."
"Neurons communicate with each other as well as with other target cells through specialized cell junctions, known as synapses. There are two types of synapse. They may be electrical , where ions or small molecules may go from one cell into another cell by traversing small, contiguous channels present in the cell membranes of the two cells."
"The other type are chemical, where one cell releases ligands  into a narrow intercellular space, known as the synaptic cleft, and the ligand binds to receptors of the other cell’s membrane, initiating the desired result. Neuroglia are located both in the CNS and in the PNS. They act to support the neuron, both physically and nutritionally, to protect the neuron by forming an insulating sheath around it and its processes, as well as to isolate the neuron and its processes from the external milieu."
"It is interesting to note that the number of neuroglia far outnumber the number of neurons. The neuron has two regions, the cell body  and neuronal processes called dendrites and axons ; a neuron may possess several dendrites but it has only a single axon. Dendrites and axons frequently possess a higher percentage of the neuron’s cytoplasm than does the soma, due to the large number of dendrites per neuron as well as due to the, possibly, great length of the axon."
"The size and morphology of the cell body vary and are specific to the particular region of the nervous system. The most prominent feature of the soma is the nucleus, which is usually round to oval, centrally placed, and possesses a fine chromatin network and a well-defined nucleolus. The cytoplasm of the perikaryon is rich in free ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum , whose cisternae form numerous close, parallel configurations which, when viewed with light microscopy, stain dark blue with acidophilic stains and are frequently referred to as Nissl bodies."
"Protein synthesis occurs on both free ribosomes for use in the cytosol and on the RER for eventual packaging. The Golgi complex is usually near the nucleus and is responsible for the modification and packaging of the various proteins, enzymes, and chemical messenger molecules manufactured on the RER. Numerous profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum  are also present in the neuronal cytoplasm."
"Many of these are located just deep to the plasmalemma as hypolemmal cisternae, believed to be responsible for the sequestering of calcium. The energy requirement of the neuron is met by the presence of numerous mitochondria, which are distributed throughout the cell body. As such, protein synthesis, respiration, and many of the essential cellular functions occur in this region of the cell ."
"The cell body is also rich in endosomes and lysosomes, as well as various types of vesicles that are being ferried to and from the processes. The cell body also contains numerous inclusions, nonliving substances such as melanin pigments, lipofuscin, and lipid droplets. Melanin pigments are present in cells only in certain locations, such as the locus cereus and the substantia nigra, but their function in these cells is not known."
"Lipofuscin is believed to be the indigestible remains of lysosomal activity and, since it is known to increase as a function of age, it is frequently referred to as “age pigment. ” Lipid droplets are present in the cytoplasm of neurons, and in other cells, as a form of energy reserve. Cytoskeletal components of neurons consist of microfilaments, neurofilaments, and microtubules."
"Microfilaments, composed mostly of filamentous actin, are associated mainly with the cell membrane and aid in axon or dendrite elongation and in the movement of the plasmalemma. Neurofilaments are intermediate filaments that frequently become clumped during preparation for light microscopy, forming long filamentous threads known as neurofibrils . Neurofilaments assist in the regeneration and development of axons and dendrites."
"Microtubules are long, rigid, flexible structures that possess microtubule-associated proteins . Microtubules provide a scaffold-like structure to maintain cell shape and aid in the transport of materials to and from the soma. Dendrites, whose proximal region may house organelles, such as RER, SER, mitochondria, and vesicles, are relatively short, branching extensions of the cell body."
"Each neuron may have a number of dendrites, each of which receives signals from specialized receptors, axons, or other neurons and transmits these signals toward the cell body. Often the surface of some dendrites is increased due to the presence of dendritic spines, permitting the presence of a greater number of synapses. Moreover, since dendrites are usually highly branched structures they may receive information concurrently from many different sources."
"The axon is divided into three regions: the initial segment, the axon proper, and the axon terminals. The initial segment is the short transition  between the axon hillock and the axon proper. A characteristic feature of the initial segment is the thickening on the axoplasmic aspect of the axolemma  that is believed to be indicative of the presence of voltagegated sodium channels."
"The initial segment is the primary region of the axon responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. The axon proper is a long process , whose diameter, which may be as great as 15–20 µm, remains constant for much of its length. Axons may possess a myelin covering  that begins at the axon proper and stops at the axon terminal."
"The myelin sheath is elaborated in discontinuous segments, and each myelinated segment is called an internode. The discontinuities of myelin between adjacent internodes are referred to as nodes of Ranvier. Occasionally the axon proper has branches, known as collaterals, that diverge from the main axon at right angles."
"At its terminus the axon may arborize, forming numerous axon terminals , which permits a single axon to make synaptic contact  with numerous other neurons . The axoplasm does not possess ribosomes or RER, although mitochondria, SER, vesicles, neurofilaments, and microtubules are present. Material produced in the soma is transported, via the assistance of microtubules and their microtubule-associated proteins, to the axon for its use."
"Such transport is referred to as anterograde transport. Material, such as horseradish peroxidase, may be conveyed in the opposite direction, toward the cell body, and this process is referred to as retrograde transport. Collectively, anterograde and retrograde transports are referred to as axonal transport, a process that is dependent on the presence of the ATPase molecular motors dynein and kinesin."
"The former is responsible for retrograde transport, whereas the latter functions in anterograde transport. Table 3. 1 details the types and velocity of transport and the substances being transported."
"Axonal transport is essential for the health of the muscle cell or the gland that is being innervated. If this trophic relationship is interrupted, the muscle or gland atrophies. A synapse may be electrical with a synaptic cleft width of 2–4 nm or chemical with a synaptic cleft width of 20–30 nm."
"In an electrical synapse ions are exchanged via gap junctions, whereas in a chemical synapse messenger molecules  are housed in synaptic vesicles and are released into the synaptic cleft. These messenger molecules are of two types, namely neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and they are released from the axon terminal to depolarize  the membrane of the effector cell. Since electrical synapses are seldom present in mammals , only chemical synapses will be discussed in this textbook and the reader is referred to a textbook of histology or cell biology to become familiar with the structure of gap junctions."
"There are several types of possible synaptic contacts within the CNS , depending upon the regions of the neurons involved , the most common being the axodendritic, where the axon of one neuron synapses with the dendrite of another neuron. In all chemical synapses the “message” travels across the synaptic cleft to the effector cell, giving rise to the terminology: presynaptic cell  and postsynaptic cell . Thus there are three major functional components of a synapse, namely the presynaptic membrane, the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic membrane."
"These membranes are specialized so that the messenger molecules contained in the synaptic vesicles are released at the proper sites  on the presynaptic membrane, and so that they bind to receptor molecules located at specific sites of the postsynaptic membrane. When seen in electron micrographs, the cytoplasmic aspect of either one of these membranes frequently displays a filamentous electron density known as the presynaptic density or postsynaptic density. Depending on the arrangement of these submembrane densities, the synapses are said to be either type I or type II ."
"Type I synapses are also known as asymmetric synapses since their postsynaptic density is thicker than their presynaptic density. Type II synapses are also referred to as symmetric synapses since the two densities are of equal thickness. Usually, type I synapses possess round synaptic vesicles whereas type II synapses possess flattened synaptic vesicles."
"Generally, type I synapses are excitatory, so that the membrane of the effector cell becomes depolarized, initiating an excitatory postsynaptic potential . Conversely, type II synapses are usually inhibitory, initiating an inhibitory postsynaptic potential  so that the membrane of the effector cell becomes hyperpolarized, causing it to be less responsive to attempts at depolarization. The cytoplasm of the axon terminal is rich in cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules, neurofilaments, spectrin, and microfilaments."
"Additionally, it also houses cisternae of SER, coated vesicles, occasional endosomes, a number of mitochondria, and numerous synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles are membrane-bound vesicles whose membranes contain numerous unique integral proteins that assist in binding the vesicles to specific sites within the axon terminal. They contain chemical messengers , ATP, and some proteoglycans, all of which are destined to be released into the synaptic cleft."
"Some of these synaptic vesicles are held in reserve away from the active site, whereas others are located at the active site. The submembrane density on the cytoplasmic aspect of the presynaptic membrane is composed of globular to oblong electron-dense subunits that are arranged in a hexagonal array at the active site . These oblong structures are protein complexes, known as docking complexes, which form a presynaptic grid whose interstices are just large enough to accept synaptic vesicles but prevent these vesicles from contacting the presynaptic membrane."
"Most synaptic vesicles are held in reserve, away from the active site. However, some are bound  to the docking complex so that when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal they are ready to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, open into the synaptic cleft, and release their messenger molecules. The arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic membrane opens voltage-gated calcium channels located at the active site , permitting the influx of Ca2+ ions into the axon terminal ."
The presence of Ca2+ ions permits the fusion of the membrane of the docked synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic membrane and the subsequent release of its messenger molecules into the synaptic cleft. Precise control of calcium availability is necessary to ensure that only the required amount of messenger molecules are released as the consequence of a single action potential. The sequestering of Ca2+ ions is performed by at least three mechanisms: 1 A cytosolic protein binds Ca2+ ions in the vicinity of the presynaptic membrane.
2 Calcium storage vesicles located in the axon terminal possess Ca2+ pumps that remove Ca2+ ions from the end-foot cytosol. 3 Na+/Ca2+-coupled transporters in the axon terminal membrane exchange extracellular Na+ ions for cytosolic Ca2+ ions. These three mechanisms act in conjunction with each other to control Ca2+ availability at the active site .
"Continued synaptic vesicle fusion with and incorporation into the presynaptic membrane would enlarge the axon terminal; therefore, the excess membrane is recaptured by the formation of clathrin-coated pits. The pits form clathrincoated vesicles and the captured membranes are returned to the cytosol. They travel as endocytic vesicles, possibly along microtubule-marked pathways."
"These vesicles lose their clathrin coat before fusing with the elements of SER to be recycled in the formation of new synaptic vesicles. Since the flow of Ca2+ ions into the axon terminal is very important for the release of the messenger molecules into the synaptic cleft, a method of diminishing its entry into the endfoot has evolved in mammals, a process known as presynaptic inhibition. This process occurs in areas where an axon forms a synapse with the axon terminal of another axon ."
"Hence, there are three neurons involved at this location: 1 The axon terminal of neuron A contacting the axon terminal of neuron B. 2 The axon terminal of neuron B that contacts neuron C. 3 The dendrite  of neuron C."
"The axon terminal of neuron A releases a chemical messenger destined for Cl− ion channels of the axon terminal of neuron B. The binding of the ligands opens Cl− ion channels causing an influx of Cl− ions into the axon terminal of neuron B, hyperpolarizing its presynaptic membrane and making it much more difficult to open its voltage-gated Ca2+ ion channels. This event makes it less likely that neuron B will be able to release its chemical messengers intended for neuron C, and it is this inhibition of the activity of neuron B that is referred to as presynaptic inhibition."
"The synaptic cleft is a 20– 30 nm wide extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. This space contains diverse families of macromolecules, some of which appear to be filamentous and span the entire width of the synaptic cleft. Many of these macromolecules are believed to be the extracytoplasmic aspects of the various transmembrane proteins of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, whereas others are molecules of the extracellular matrix."
"It has been demonstrated that many of these synaptic cleft proteins are necessary to maintain a rigorous alignment of the active sites of the presynaptic membrane with those regions of the postsynaptic membrane that house receptor molecules designed to bind the released chemical messengers. These chemical substances, released in predetermined quantities, known as quanta , cross the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptor molecules of the postsynaptic membrane. Each synaptic vesicle contains one quantum of chemical messenger molecules, which is the minimum amount necessary to precipitate a single postsynaptic event ."
"The postsynaptic membrane is a region of the effector cell plasmalemma that is modified to receive and react to the chemical messenger  released into the synaptic cleft. Binding of the ligand results in the opening of ion channels with subsequent depolarization or hyperpolarization of the effector cell plasmalemma. The submembrane density of the postsynaptic membrane is connected, via thin filamentous material, to an abundance of intertwined cytoskeletal elements, the subsynaptic web."
"The cytosol in the immediate vicinity of the subsynaptic web houses, among others, microtubules, microfilaments, SER and, frequently, RER along with numerous mitochondria. The cytosol also contains enzymes such as protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent kinase II. The postsynaptic membrane houses two major types of receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors."
"1 Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and the chemical messengers that bind to them are known as neurotransmitters. The binding of a neurotransmitter alters the conformation of the protein constituting the ion channel, opening it and permitting the flow of ions through it. Thus, a neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that has a direct effect on the ion channel and the effect is rapid."
"2 Metabotropic receptors bind chemical messengers known as neuromodulators or neurohormones. These molecules also interact with a receptor molecule, causing a conformational change in its protein; however, this receptor molecule is not an ion channel. Instead, this receptor molecule interacts with other protein complexes, such as G-proteins."
"G-proteins in turn interact with one of the cell’s secondary messenger systems, thus modulating the metabolic activities of the effector cell. In this fashion the required response occurs as an indirect function of the coupling of the ligand to the receptor and the effect is slow. The above two points are true in most instances, but there are exceptions."
"The following generalization should therefore be appreciated, namely that neurotransmitters have a direct influence, whereas neuromodulators and neurohormones have an indirect influence in effecting the desired result. It is also important to realize that the same chemical messenger may elicit different responses depending on the type of ionotropic or metabotropic receptor with which it is associated. The various types of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are discussed in Chapter 4."
"The number of processes a neuron possesses permits a classification of these cells into the following categories: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons . Unipolar neurons are rare in vertebrates; they possess no dendrites, only an axon. Bipolar neurons, such as the ones in the olfactory mucosa, possess an axon and a dendrite, whereas multipolar neurons, such as the motoneurons of the spinal cord, have a single axon and two or more dendrites."
"An additional type of neuron, the pseudounipolar neuron  start out, during embryogenesis, as bipolar neurons. The axon and dendrite of this neuron fuse into a single process that later bifurcates. Neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and the ganglia of cranial nerves are representatives of this category."
"There are five types of supporting cells associated with the nervous system, four in the CNS  and one in the PNS  . Neuroglia of the CNS are usually smaller and about 10 times more numerous than neurons. Astrocytes are stellate-shaped cells with numerous, long processes that extend between and among the neurons and vascular elements occupying much of the extracellular spaces of the CNS."
"Their processes surround all neural elements and also form gap junctions with one another. Additionally, astrocytes form a perivascular covering around blood vessels as well as a glial-limiting membrane at the interface of the brain and pia mater. There are two types of astrocytes: fibrous astrocytes, located in white matter, and protoplasmic astrocytes, located in gray matter."
"Both types of astrocytes are characterized by the unique glial fibrillary acidic protein  intermediate filaments contained in their cytoplasm. Astrocytes are believed to: • provide physical and nutritional support to the neurons of the CNS; • sequester Na+ and K+ ions from the extracellular space; • isolate neurons from each other; • metabolize extracellular neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid , and glutamate; • form glial scar tissue in an attempt to repair damage to the CNS; and • form a framework along which developing neurons migrate to their destination during embryogenesis. Oligodendroglia are small cells that possess only a few processes and their cytoplasm is devoid of GFAP."
"They are present in gray matter, where they abut neurons and are sometimes referred to as satellite oligodendrocytes. They are most numerous in white matter, where they form myelin sheaths around axons. Each oligodendroglion may myelinate a single internode of as many as 30 axons."
"Microglia are the smallest of the neuroglia and, unlike the others, they are derived from monocytes that, as they leave the bloodstream and enter the substance of the CNS, differentiate into small macrophages. Microglia function in the phagocytosis of damaged tissues and participate in inflammatory and degenerative reactions. Ependymal cells form the simple cuboidal to simple columnar epithelial lining of the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord."
"These cells possess cilia in some regions of the spinal canal and ventricles facilitating the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid . Ependymal cells in certain regions of the ventricles become modified and participate in the formation of the choroid plexus, the structures that are responsible for the elaboration of the CSF. Some of the ependymal cells of the third ventricle are modified and are known as tanycytes."
These modified ependymal cells possess long processes that approximate capillaries and certain neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus. It is speculated that they may transport CSF to these cells. Schwann cells are present only in the PNS.
"They are derived from neural crest cells that migrate during development to the sites of axon formation and elongation. These cells envelop the forming axons, isolating them from the surrounding environment. Schwann cells invest all unmyelinated axons as well as forming the myelin sheath of all myelinated axons of the PNS."
"Unlike oligodendroglia, a Schwann cell is capable of myelinating only a single internode of a single axon. Schwann cells form their own basal lamina and extracellular matrix, hence they are capable of synthesizing type IV collagen, the glycoproteins fibronectin and laminin, as well as various proteoglycans. Schwann cells also function during degeneration and regeneration of axons."
"Each axon is served by a large number of oligodendroglia or neuroglia, since a single one of these cells is capable of myelinating only a short segment of an axon. These short, myelin-wrapped segments are known as internodes , and the unmyelinated regions of the axon located between adjacent internodes are known as nodes of Ranvier . As described above, oligodendroglia myelinate in the CNS only and Schwann cells myelinate in the PNS only."
"Moreover, a single oligodendroglion is able to myelinate a single internode of as many as 30 different axons , whereas a single Schwann cell is capable of myelinating only one internode of one axon. Although the mechanism of myelination is not understood, it is believed that the process is similar whether it occurs in the peripheral or the central nervous system, therefore, only Schwann cell myelination will be discussed here. As the axon reaches 1 µm in diameter, Schwann cells proliferate, forming a continuous chain of cells along the length of the axon."
"As they envelop the axon, they begin to layer their membranes  in a spiral fashion around the axon . As the developing myelin sheath becomes more tightly wound, the cytoplasm of the wrapped region retracts into the Schwann cell body, and the cytoplasmic aspects of the apposing cell membranes approximate each other. Moreover, the extracytoplasmic aspects of the cell membranes also approach one another."
"Viewed with the electron microscope the myelin sheath presents the appearance of concentric, wider, electron-dense lines alternating with concentric, narrower, less electrondense lines. The wider lines  represent the apposition of the cytoplasmic surfaces of the Schwann cell plasmalemma, and are called major dense lines. The narrower lines represent the apposition of the outer surfaces of the Schwann cell plasmalemma, and are known as intraperiod lines."
"Although these lines appearto be concentric, they are actually spiral lines. The outer surfaces of the Schwann cell plasmalemma do not contact each other, necessitating a change of terminology to intraperiod gap. This intraperiod gap is believed to be a conduit so that small molecules can reach the axon."
"The beginning of the internal aspect  of the intraperiod gap is known as the internal mesaxon, whereas the distal aspect of the intraperiod gap  is referred to as the external mesaxon. At the edges of the Schwann cell, in the region of the node of Ranvier, bubbles of cytoplasm remain that separate the major dense line. Additionally, some of the cytoplasm may remain in the region of the internode, forming oblique arrays of bubbles of cytoplasm."
"When whole mounts of teased myelinated nerve fibers are viewed with the light microscope these areas appear as clear slanted lines in the myelin sheaths and are known as clefts  of Schmidt–Lantermann. The process of myelination occurs over a period of several years and, as such, some axons are myelinated much sooner than others. Motor nerves are the first to be myelinated whereas sensory nerves are not myelinated until several months after birth."
"Certain regions of the CNS do not become completely myelinated until several years after birth. Myelin is composed of approximately 70–80% lipids and the remainder consists of proteins and water. The preponderant lipid constituent is cholesterol, followed by phospholipids and glycosphingolipids."
"There are several proteins whose roles in the structural integrity of the myelin sheath are beginning to be understood . P0 and P2 are present mostly in PNS myelin, P1 is located in both PNS and CNS myelin, and proteolipid protein  is the major structural protein that is present only in CNS myelin. All of these proteins are transmembrane proteins and are believed to play a role in the compaction of the major dense line, since their cytoplasmic aspects are composed of highly charged amino acids that attract their counterparts on the other side of the membrane."
"Another protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein , has globular subunits that extend into the extracellular space  of the myelin sheaths of both the CNS and PNS. Here they contact MAGs from the other side, thus establishing adhesive forces that hold the external aspects of the Schwann cell plasmalemma in close proximity. The cytoplasmic aspects of this transmembrane protein are associated with the cytoskeletal components spectrin and actin, thus reinforcing the rigorous architecture of the myelin sheath."
"Nerve fibers transmit information along their membranes, which become depolarized subsequent to suitable stimulation. Modulation of the transmembrane resting potential, due to the actions of voltage-gated ion channels, results in the transmission of an electrical signal along the dendrites, soma, and/or axon either as an action potential or as a postsynaptic potential. The resting potential is the voltage difference existing between the two sides  of the semipermeable membrane of any cell."
"This voltage difference is present only in the immediate vicinity of the membrane, since deeper in the cytoplasm and farther out in the extracellular space the electric charges are neutral. Neurons possess constant permeability K+ ion channels that establish a specific charge difference  between the two sides of the membrane, so that its cytoplasmic aspect appears negative with respect to its extracellular aspect. In order to understand the establishment of a resting potential one must realize that there are two factors operating on this semipermeable membrane, the concentration gradient and the electrical gradient."
"Since the intracellular concentration of K+ is greater than the extracellular concentration, potassium is being driven by a concentration gradient from the cell into the extracellular space. Potassium ions travel through ion channels that are not gated and are known as K+ leak channels. Because only K+ ions are permitted through these channels an electrical imbalance is established ."
"It should be understood that a K+ ion may travel in either direction through the same K+ leak channel. At the point where the concentration gradient’s “desire” to push potassium out of the cell and the electrical imbalance’s “desire” to return potassium into the cell equal each other, the net flow of K+ ions becomes zero. This does not mean that there is no flow of K+ ions across the membrane, it simply means that the same number of K+ ions flow into the cell as out of the cell."
"The establishment of this equilibrium potential  is described by the Nernst equation:  where Vm is the membrane potential in volts; R is the gas constant; T is the temperature in °K; F is Faraday’s constant; Z is the ion valence; and  is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the cytoplasmic to extracellular concentration of K+ ions. The Nernst equation can be applied for all ions, and is solved for the most common ions in Table 3. 5."
"However, the Nernst equation assumes that only the particular ion in question is permitted to traverse the cell membrane. However, this is not a true situation as ion channels of the plasma membrane, particularly of the neuron’s membrane, are open simultaneously, thus permitting several ions to cross the plasmalemma. This state of affairs is better described by the Goldman equation."
"The Goldman equation describes the membrane potential as a function of the relative permeability of the cell membrane to more than a single species of ions. Since the neuron membrane is influenced by at least three ions, Na+, K+, and Cl−, all three are considered in the Goldman equation:  As is evident the Goldman equation is very similar to the Nernst equation, but it predicts the membrane potential from the concentration of several ions and the permeability of the membrane to those ions. It is interesting to note that the two equations would be identical if the permeability of two of the three ions were zero."
"Therefore, the Goldman equation is the Nernst equation expanded for multiple ions and consequently it calculates a more realistic resting membrane potential for neurons. The resting potential of a general neuron plasma membrane is approximately −71 mV when the ion concentrations inside and outside the cell equal the values listed in Table 3. 5."
"The chloride ion concentration does not have much of an effect on the resting potential, indicating that it is the K+ gradient that has the greatest role in establishing the resting potential. The following mental exercise should help in clarifying this statement. If we assume that originally the potential difference across the membrane is zero but the intracellular concentration of K+ is greater than on the outside, K+ will follow its concentration gradient and leave the cell via the K+ leak channels."
"As these positive ions leave the cell, the inside of the membrane will become more negative, the outside of the membrane will become more positive, and this electrical imbalance will begin to drive K+ back into the cell. At the same time the concentration gradient will continue to drive K+ out of the cell and there will come a point where the electric force and the concentration gradient force will equal each other. It is at that point that the same number of K+ ions will leave the cell as enter the cell and, therefore, the net flow of K+ equals zero, thus establishing the resting membrane potential."
"Simultaneously, Cl− ions will be unable to enter the cell because the negative charges oppose their inward movement, thus preventing Cl− ions from having much of an influence on the resting membrane potential. A further point to consider in this mental exercise is the number of ions that have to be involved in the establishment of the membrane potential. Since there are a far greater number of ions inside the cell than just those in the immediate vicinity  of the cell membrane, the actual number of K+ ions that have to leave the cell per unit area of membrane is miniscule when compared to the concentration of K+ inside the cell."
"A final point of interest is the effect of the Na+/K+ pump on the resting membrane potential. It should be recalled that this pump uses energy to move three Na+ ions out of the cell into the extracellular space in exchange for two K+ ions that it brings into the cell from the extracellular space. If the Na+/K+ pump is inactivated the membrane resting potential will become somewhat less negative and if the pump remains inactive for a longer period of time , the resting membrane potential becomes disturbed."
"However, some time before that happens, cations, especially Na+, slowly enter the cell and the intracellular Na+ concentration becomes greater. As the concentration of Na+ increases, the ion concentration inside the cell will also increase, driving water into the cell. Thus, the major function of the Na+/K+ pump in the cell is the maintenance of the cell’s osmotic balance."
"When the resting potential is disturbed at a particular point, voltage-gated ion channels open and the passage of specific ions through the membrane generates a small, localized electric current. If the current is the result of the inward movement of cations , the resting potential is decreased to such an extent that the polarity of the membrane is reversed . This local current is very small and its ability to evoke an action potential diminishes: • as a function of its distance from the initial segment of the axon; and • as a function of the time elapsed between the initiation of the current and its arrival at the initial segment."
"If the current is the result of the inward movement of anions through a voltage-gated channel  the resting potential is increased , leading to an increased resistance to depolarization . Action potentials last only a few milliseconds and occur due to the influx of Na+ ions into the neuron through voltage-gated Na+ ion channels. These channels exist in one of three configurations: closed, open, or refractory."
"When the resting potential reaches a threshold level , the Na+ ion channel opens instantaneously  and remains open, permitting a rapid influx of Na+ ions. As the number of Na+ ions increases at the cytoplasmic aspect of the membrane, the accumulation of positive charges internally  becomes greater than externally . Thus the inner aspect appears “more” positive than the external aspect and the membrane is said to have become depolarized ."
"At this point we must revise our initial image of the voltage-gated sodium channel. Instead of assuming a single gate on the channel we must envision two gates. The first is the activation gate  whereas the second is the inactivation gate , and both gates must be open for Na+ ions to pass through the ion channel."
"At resting potential the activation gate is closed, the inactivation gate is open, and Na+ ions cannot pass through. When the threshold level  is reached the activation gate opens, the inactivation gate remains open, and Na+ ions enter the cell through the ion channel. As the positive charge on the internal aspect builds up and the membrane is depolarized , the inactivation gate slowly closes, and Na+ ions can no longer pass through the Na+ ion channel."
"For 1–2 ms thereafter the inactivation gate remains closed and the Na+ ion channel cannot respond to alteration in the resting potential. Thus, the Na+ ion channel is inactivated; it cannot be opened, and the axon is said to be in the absolute refractory period. Once the cell membrane is repolarized the activation gate shuts, the inactivation gate slowly opens, and, although Na+ ions still cannot pass through the Na+ ion channel, the Na+ ion channel once again can respond to alterations in the resting potential."
"In response to the sodium influx-induced depolarization of the membrane, voltage-gated K+ ion channels slowly open and remain open for a longer period of time than do Na+ ion channels. It should be noted that voltage-gate K+ channels are different from K+-leak channels. They open only during depolarization, whereas K+-leak channels are always open."
"The increased positive charge  on the internal aspect of the membrane drives K+ ions out to the external aspect of the cell membrane. This efflux of K+ ions is so intense that it hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the initiation of a second depolarization more arduous, until the resting membrane potential is re-established. This period of time is known as the relative refractory period and contributes to the total refractory period."
"An action potential is a local event involving a short segment of an axon and it lasts merely a few milliseconds. In order to utilize action potentials for the transmission of information they must be able to advance along the axon in a single direction, until they reach the axon terminal. The following points recap the previous discussion of events occurring at a voltage-gated Na+ ion channel: 1 The influx of Na+ ions reversed the polarity of the membrane at that particular point."
"2 The positive ions flowed away from the original site of entry, dispersing both toward the soma and toward the axon terminal. 3 As the positive charges reached the neighboring Na+ ion channel , the resting membrane potential was disrupted, that is the internal aspect of the axon membrane became more positive due to the presence of excess Na+ ions. 4 Once the threshold level was reached the Na+ ion channel opened permitting the entry of more Na+ ions, resulting in the depolarization of the membrane at the new point and a new action potential was generated."
"5 In this fashion the action potential is constantly regenerated  at sequential Na+ ion channels until the wave of depolarization reaches the axon terminal. 6 Remembering the discussion concerning the refractory period, it should be clear that those Na+ ions that entered at the Na+ ion channel and dispersed toward the soma encountered Na+ ion channels that were still inactivated, and their inactivation gates could not be opened. 7 Since the inactivation gate remained closed Na+ ions could not pass through the Na+ ion channel and the membrane could not be depolarized at the old point."
"8 Therefore, the action potential in a normal in vivo situation can travel only in a single direction, away from the soma toward the axon terminal. The conduction velocity of an action potential is directly dependent on the diameter of the axon. The conduction velocity is further increased due to axon myelination ."
"As indicated above, in an unmyelinated axon the propagation of the action potential is dependent on the sequential activation of successive Na+ ion channels. In a myelinated axon voltage-gated Na+ ion channels are much farther apart, located only at the nodes of Ranvier, requiring that the generation of action potentials occurs only at the nodes. Hence, the current must “jump” from node to node , a much faster process than that occurring in unmyelinated axons."
"Small local currents, initiated by the release of chemical messengers from synaptic vesicles are spread throughout the cell body of the neuron, and are known as postsynaptic potentials . As mentioned earlier, the ability of these postsynaptic potentials to evoke an action potential diminishes as a function of: • their distance from the initial segment of the axon; and • the amount of time that has elapsed from the time the depolarization occurred at the initial segment of the axon. The reason for this is that the dendrites and soma have relatively few voltage-gated channels—a specific requirement for the formation and propagation of action potentials."
"An increase in the number of postsynaptic potentials , however, results in their summation. Hence, hundreds of nearly simultaneous, small postsynaptic potentials may be necessary to achieve the threshold required for the formation of an action potential when those currents arrive at the initial segment of the axon. Generally, inhibitory synapses are closer to the initial segment of the axon than are excitatory synapses."
"Since inhibitory synapses function to hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane, they tend to diminish the flow of currents formed at the excitatory potential making it more difficult to reach threshold levels at the initial segment of the axon. This sequence of events is referred to as the summation of IPSPs and EPSPs . Leigh’s syndrome , a childhood disease, is due to mutations in the mitochondrial DNA as well as mutations in chromosome 9  of neurons located in the basal ganglia."
"Children afflicted with this disease initially lose their verbal abilities and muscular coordination, and later may exhibit dementia, seizures, and optic atrophy; many die due to respiratory failure. Tay–Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease where specific neurons are unable to synthesize the enzyme hexosaminidase A. These defective lysosomes are unable to digest sphingolipids, which continue to accumulate and impede the normal functioning of the cell, leading to cell death."
"This autosomal recessive trait is especially prominent in families of Eastern European Jewish descent. Its symptoms—hyperacusis, irritability, hypotonia, reduced motor skills, blindness with red spots in the macula, and seizures—appear before the first year of life and result in the death of the child between the second and fourth year of age. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by progressive demyelination of the white matter in the brain and spinal cord."
"This condition, believed to be an autoimmune disease, usually appears in the young adult and is distinguished by periods of deterioration followed by periods of remission that may continue for decades. As the disease progresses the periods of remission become shorter and the disability becomes greater due, among other things, to the decreased velocity of impulse propagation in the affected axons. Any one of the demyelination episodes may lead to death within a short period of time."
"Neuroglial tumors account for approximately half of intracranial tumors. They range in severity from the relatively mild oligodendroglioma to the highly malignant, and fatal, glioblastoma. The latter disease originates from very rapidly proliferating astrocyte-derived neoplastic cells that invade the cerebrum."
"The patient underwent an MRI examination of the brain and CSF examination that confirm he has multiple sclerosis . MS is a neurologic disease that can vary widely in symptomatology, since it can cause lesions in any part of the CNS. However, it only affects the white matter."
"More specifically, prototypical MS causes demyelination of axons in the CNS by death or injury to oligodendrocytes. In most cases there is relative preservation of the axons. The understanding of the pathophysiology is incomplete, but it is clear that there is an immunologic attack causing loss of or dysfunction of oligodendrocytes."
"However, it is not a typical autoimmune condition since most of the medications used for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis do not work . The diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI of the appropriate area of the CNS. The patient in the case study had multiple demyelinating plaques in the cerebellum and brain, including the corpus callosum ."
"The lesions of MS are often periventricular in location. There are often lesions seen that are clinically “silent. ” Using CSF and serum electrophoresis, synthesis of antibodies within the CNS and not the serum is often demonstrated."
"This is pathologic. One definition for MS is that it causes multiple lesions in the CNS in space and time. Multiple focal white matter plaques of demyelination, easily seen by MRI, are present in different parts of the brain, brainstem, and/or spinal cord at different times."
"Peripheral nerve myelin is not affected at all since it is produced differently. The most common syndrome is a relapsing/remitting course. Over the course of many years symptoms occur in episodes lasting typically weeks or months, and then symptoms spontaneously improve."
"Over the course of years, after a number of relapses, this can lead to disability. Common symptoms of relapses include, but are certainly not limited to, focal numbness/tingling or weakness, gait ataxia, visual loss , slurred speech, paraplegia and sensory disturbance up to a thoracic dermatome level, and ocular motility problems . One characteristic of MS is that heat or a rise in body temperature can temporarily bring about symptoms typical of that particular patient’s MS."
"This is not due to any new lesions happening within the CNS. A rise in temperature actually reduces the efficiency of conduction along axons. The effects are not seen in people with normal CNS function because there is a large reserve capacity for conduction, but this is not so in the old plaques of demyelination in patients with MS."
"It is common for MS patients to complain of symptoms surfacing temporarily with fevers, hot baths or showers, prolonged exertion, or sunbathing. A 60-year-old man presents to your office with imbalance and a few falls. He has had some severe bumps and bruises from the falls, which prompted him to come in to see the doctor."
"Symptoms seemed to begin about 6 months previously, and are slowly getting worse. Also noted is a tremor that primarily involves the right hand, and is most prominent when at rest and when walking. In fact, the patient barely notices it but it is very bothersome to his wife."
"His movements, according to his wife, seem very slow and stiff. The patient does not make good eye contact when being spoken to, and gaze is directed downward. Facial expression is limited, and there seems to be a paucity of spontaneous movements."
"All movements, including walking, speaking, reaching, etc. , are very slow but performed accurately. There is a tremor, most prominent in the right hand, which is most noticeable at rest and goes away when reaching for objects."
"It is also enhanced when walking, and writing is poor. Walking is slow with short, shuffling steps. Cells of the nervous system communicate with each other at synapses either via electrical signals or by the release of relatively small messenger molecules."
"The morphology and physiology of electrical and chemical synapses were presented in Chapter 3, whereas the current chapter discusses the most common and significant of the neurotransmitter substances  . These messenger molecules may be classified into two major types, those that bind directly to ion channels  and those that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. The neurotransmitter substances that bind specifically to ligand-gated ion channels cause those channels to open directly, thus the target neuron responds immediately, resulting in an ionotropic effect ."
"Those neurotransmitter substances that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors exert an indirect effect on ion channels. Since the G-proteins act as intermediaries, the effect on the target neuron is slower than in the previous instance. Thus, these neurotransmitter substances are frequently known as neuromodulators, and they are said to exert a metabotropic effect ."
"In order for a substance to be considered a neurotransmitter  it must possess five basic characteristics:  they must be synthesized by presynaptic neurons;  they have to reside within the synaptic terminals ;  they are released from the presynaptic terminals by way of a calcium-dependent mechanism;  they have to bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane; and  they must be inactivated in the synaptic cleft. Each neuron has at least one, but usually a number of neurotransmitter substances—co-transmitters—in its presynaptic terminal . These co-transmitters may be released individually or together, and they are usually housed in different synaptic vesicles."
"It is interesting to note that the “classic” neurotransmitters  are stored in small, electron-lucent synaptic vesicles, whereas neuropeptides are stored in somewhat larger, dense-cored secretory granules. Neurotransmitter substances may be classified into four different groups: biogenic amines, neuropeptides, small molecule neurotransmitters, and other ligands. Biogenic amines, amino acid derivatives, bind to G-protein-coupled receptors and activate the second messenger system within the target neuron, which in turn will open ion channels."
"Biogenic amines include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine , and histamine and serotonin. Upon release from the presynaptic terminal, biogenic amines are endocytosed by the nerve terminals and glial cells, and are digested by the enzymes cathecol O-methyltranferase and monoamine oxidase . In this fashion, each release of these neurotransmitters is responsible for only a limited number of depolarizations/hyperpolarizations."
"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors  are drugs that act within the presynaptic neuron to inactivate catecholamines and indoleamines. They also act to increase the concentration of other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, and, by some unknown mechanism, relieve depression. The three major catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, have similar characteristics."
"They are all derivatives of the amino acid tyrosine, they have a catechol component, and the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase participates in the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine  . Dopamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter present in neurons of various regions of the central nervous system . They include the neurons of the arcuate nucleus, a group of nerve cell bodies that project to the infundibulum of the hypophysis, the neurons of the ventral tegmentum whose axons project to the limbic system, and the neurons of the substantia nigra whose axons project to the striatum."
"Norepinephrine , an excitatory neurotransmitter located in postganglionic sympathetic neurons, is derived from dopamine. The conversion occurs in the presynaptic terminals of adrenergic neurons and is facilitated by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase. An additional site where norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter is the locus ceruleus."
"Neurons of the locus ceruleus project to the reticular formation as well as to various other regions of the CNS. Higher than normal levels of norepinephrine in the CNS have been associated with mania, whereas lower than normal levels have been associated with depression. Additionally, panic disorders have also been associated with abnormal levels of norepinephrine in the CNS."
"Epinephrine  is an excitatory neurotransmitter derived from norepinephrine. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. Very few neurons of the CNS use epinephrine as a neurotransmitter substance, and those that do are restricted to the rostral medulla oblongata."
"Serotonin is a derivative of tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan by the ratelimiting enzyme tryptophan-5-hydroxylase. Decarboxylation of 5-hydroxytryptophan results in the formation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter . Neurons that use serotonin as their neurotransmitter substance are known as serotonergic neurons, and they are present in the pons, medulla, raphe nuclei of the midbrain, and pineal body."
These neurons function in arousal and sleep modulation as well as in regulating certain higher cognitive functions. Moreover these neurons may exert modulatory effects on cathecolamine levels. Histamine is an inflammatory pharmacologic agent released by mast cells and basophils.
"It is responsible for causing capillaries to become leaky and also for contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscles. In the nervous system it is located mostly in the hypophysis and the median eminence of the hypothalamus. It appears that histamine may affect emotion, memory, and learning, through H1 receptors."
"Initially, many of the neuropeptides were known as hormones in the digestive and respiratory systems, but subsequently they were observed to function also as neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Neuropeptides are small polypeptides, cleaved, post-translationally before they reach the Golgi apparatus, from larger propeptide molecules synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum  in the soma. The cleaved neuropeptides are packaged into secretory vesicles in the transGolgi network and transferred, via the rapid anterograde transport, to the presynaptic terminal."
"Often, a presynaptic terminal may possess and release a number of different neuropeptides simultaneously, but once released, instead of being recycled, they are destroyed by peptidases. Thus, a single release of a quantum of neuropeptides cannot elicit multiple responses from the postsynaptic cell. Depending on the specific neuropeptides and/or their receptors, these small peptides may be excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters or neuromodulators."
"Although there are numerous neuropeptides, only the most common ones will be detailed in this textbook, namely somatostatin, substance P, and the opioid neuropeptides, endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. Somatostatin  was first observed in the digestive tract as one of the paracrine hormones manufactured and released by one of the diffuse neuroendocrine system  cells. It was noted to function in inhibiting the release of other paracrine and endocrine hormones manufactured by nearby DNES cells."
"Somatostatin, in the CNS, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and is localized in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and the small spinal ganglion cells. Substance P is a small polypeptide, composed of 11 amino acids, that was first discovered in the digestive system as a product of the DNES cells. Subsequently, it was observed in the spinal cord, hippocampus, and the neocortex, as well as in the unipolar neurons of the trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia."
"Substance P is an excitatory neuropeptide that is one of the most important neurotransmitters in nociception. The opioid neuropeptides constitute a major subgroup of neuropeptides, composed of at least 20 neurotransmitter substances. Although they may be subdivided into three categories—enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins— they have three major characteristics in common in that they are mostly inhibitory, they bind to opium receptors of the postsynaptic membrane, and they serve as substance P agonists, inducing analgesia."
"Enkephalins are of two types, methionine enkephalins  and leucine enkephalins . Met-enkephalins are derived from proenkephalin and proopiomelanocortin , a large propeptide precursor that is cleaved to form the following: beta endorphins, adrenocorticotropic hormone , beta lipoprotein, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone . Leu-enkephalin is a derivative of the propeptides prodynorphin and proenkephalin."
"Enkephalins are the neurotransmitter substances used by many interneurons as well as at synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Enkephalins are also used as neurotransmitters in the limbic system, the cerebral cortex, in the striatum, and in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. The most common form of the endorphins are beta endorphins, also POMC derivatives."
"They are present in the hypothalamus where they exert an analgesic effect. As with most other opioid neuropeptides, beta endorphins are inhibitory neurotransmitter substances. Dynorphin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter substance derived from the propeptide prodynorphin."
"This neurotransmitter substance is inhibitory, and functions in pain suppression. Dynorphin is localized in the amygdala, limbic system, and in the hypothalamus. Small molecule neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, glycine, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid , are low weight substances that are usually synthesized in the presynaptic terminals."
"The enzymes required for their synthesis are translated in the soma and reach the presynaptic terminals via anterograde axonal transport. Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter substance localized both in the central and peripheral nervous systems, is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from acetyl coenzyme A  and choline by choline acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of its synthesis . Acetylcholine, as with many other neurotransmitters, has the ability to bind to both ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors."
"In skeletal muscle it is an excitatory neurotransmitter substance, binding directly to ligand-gated sodium  as well as to potassium ion channels and causing them to open. In cardiac muscle it is an inhibitory neurotransmitter substance, binding to G-protein-linked receptors  that facilitate the opening of potassium ion channels. Acetylcholine is also present in the autonomic nervous system, specifically at the preganglionic sympathetic, preganglionic parasympathetic, and postganglionic parasympathetic synapses, as well as in localized areas of the CNS such as the projection neurons of the tegmentum, interneurons of the striatum, projection neurons of the forebrain, and motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord."
"The enzyme acetylcholinesterase is present in the synaptic cleft at the postsynaptic membrane. This enzyne cleaves the released acetylcholine into its two component molecules, choline and acetyl CoA, preventing multiple depolarizations from the release of a single quantum of acetylcholine. The cleaved moieties, acetyl CoA and choline, are transported, individually, into the presynaptic terminal where they are reassembled into acetylcholine and stored in synaptic vesicles."
"Glycine, one of the most common inhibitory neurotransmitters of the spinal cord, is synthesized by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyl transferase from the amino acid serine . Usually, glycine binds to ligand-gated chloride channels. Subsequent to its release into the synaptic cleft, glycine is recaptured by glycine-specific, membranebound carrier proteins  ferried into the presynaptic terminal and is transported into synaptic vesicles for future use."
"Glutamate, probably the most common excitatory neurotransmitter, is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from glutamine, catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminase. Once glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft within the CNS, it must be quickly removed, or it will cause the postsynaptic neuron to undergo repeated excitations, resulting in neuronal degeneration and subsequent death. This process, known as excitotoxicity, results from repeated stimulation of the postsynaptic membrane receptors that open Ca2+ channels."
"The increased influx of Ca2+ into the soma results in free radical formation and damage to the neuron and its membranes. To prevent excitotoxicity, the free glutamate in the vicinity of the synapse is endocytosed by the presynaptic terminal as well as by local glia cells. The glutamate endocytosed by the presynaptic terminal is converted, by the enzyme glutamine synthetase, to glutamine, which then is converted to form glutamate."
"The same reaction occurs within the glia cells; however, these cells release the newly formed glutamine into the vicinity of the presynaptic terminal that endocytoses the glutamine and, as before, converts it into glutamate . This entire sequence is known as the glutamine– glutamate cycle. Approximately 30% of the neurons of the CNS use gamma aminobutyric acid  as an inhibitory neurotransmitter substance."
"GABA is derived from glucose by way of glutamate, whose conversion to GABA is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, utilizing pyridoxal phosphate  as a cofactor . Once GABA is released from the presynaptic terminal, the free neurotransmitter molecules  are rapidly reabsorbed by neuroglia and the presynaptic terminals by using GABA-specific membranebound protein transporters. GABA is present in local circuit interneurons and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum."
"Depending on the receptor, the binding of GABA either opens chloride or potassium ion channels or closes calcium ion channels. Although there is a plethora of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulator substances, many of them are sufficiently rare in the nervous system that they will not be addressed in this textbook. Only adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide will be discussed."
"Adenosine triphosphate  is a high energy phosphate molecule that is customarily associated with energy storage in cells. Not much is understood concerning its functions as a neurotransmitter substance, but it is known to be co-released with other neurotransmitters and it has an excitatory effect. It is present in autonomic postganglionic neurons as well as in motoneurons of the spinal cord."
"Nitric oxide  is a gas, derived from the amino acid L-arginine by the action of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. It is a very reactive molecule and, therefore, has a very short half-life. This inhibitory neurotransmitter is unusual not only because it is a gas but also due to the fact that it does not bind to membrane receptors."
"It may function in memory formation since it is located in the hippocampal formation. Additionally, NO is also present in the olfactory system, the cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, and the hypothalamus. Parkinsonism is a neurologic disorder characterized by progressive deterioration with time."
"The chief symptoms are rigidity of movement, increased tremors and trembling, being slow in initiating movement, muscle stiffness, stooping gait, and difficulties in maintaining balance. This disease is the result of the degeneration and death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which causes a decrease in the availability of the neurotransmitter substance dopamine. The reason for the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons is not understood."
"It is interesting to note that excess levels of dopamine in the ventral tegmentum has been associated with schizophrenia. Eaton–Lambert syndrome is an autoimmune disorder affecting mostly men older than 50 years of age, many of whom are long-time smokers who are also suffering from small cell lung carcinoma. The symptoms of this syndrome include weakness of the axial and limb muscles."
"Additional symptoms include xerostomia , impaired accommodation of the eyes, impotence, and the inability to elicit deep tendon reflexes. Since some of these symptoms also appear in myasthenia gravis, the two conditions resemble one another. However, in the Eaton–Lambert syndrome the ocular and bulbar muscles are rarely affected, whereas ocular paresis is normally present in myasthenia."
"The two diseases affect different regions of the myoneural junction. In the Eaton–Lambert syndrome, the autoimmune response is against the calcium ion channels of the presynaptic membrane, interfering with the flow of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal. The diminished number of calcium ions prevents the adherence of the normal number of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane, decreasing the release of acetylcholine with each stimulus, and resulting in a weak muscle contraction."
"In myasthenia gravis, the autoimmune reaction is against the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane. Therefore, even though the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane is normal, the reduced number of normal acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane results in weak muscle contraction. The muscles of the head, and especially of the eye, are the first ones to be affected, but as the disease progresses the respiratory muscles also become involved and the patient dies of respiratory insufficiency."
"Alpha latrotoxin, the venom of the black widow spider, is inserted into the presynaptic membrane of the myoneural junction, where it acts as an ungated, nonselective ion channel, permitting the entry of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal. The altered intracellular univalent cation concentration results in constant depolarization of the presynaptic terminal. Moreover, the elevated Ca2+ levels facilitate synaptic vesicle docking and the release of copious amount of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft."
"The continuous release of acetylcholine initially results in muscle rigidity and then in paralysis of the affected muscles. Huntington’s disease is a genetic disorder resulting in degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen. The reduction in GABA results in increased release of dopamine and a corresponding decrease in acetylcholine release in the striatum, causing an imbalance in the ratio of these two neurotransmitter substances."
"It is this imbalance that is responsible for the symptoms of Huntington’s disease, whose early signs include the incapacity to form new memory, the inability to make decisions, memory loss, depression, irritability, and mood swings. As the disease progresses, the patient becomes emotionally disturbed, loses cognitive faculties, and will display uncontrolled, erratic movements . The diagnosis is Parkinson’s disease, which is very common and usually easy to diagnose."
It is a purely clinical diagnosis. All testing is either normal or unrevealing. This patient was given levodopa three times a day.
His symptoms improved dramatically within a half hour of when he took his first dose. He noted that symptoms were bad in the mornings before he took his morning dose of medicine. The patient and his wife both stated that he seemed “normal” with the medicine.
"Parkinson’s disease is the most common of the class of diseases known as movement disorders. Movement disorders are caused by pathology somewhere within the basal ganglia. In the case of Parkinson’s disease, there is a degeneration of neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra, which is composed of pigmented cells."
"Dopamine is the neurotransmitter released by these neurons, to communicate with other components of the basal ganglia. In Parkinson’s disease there is a relative lack of dopamine in the basal ganglia due to the degeneration of neurons that synthesize it. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine."
"It is taken up by the remaining substantia nigra neurons, is converted to dopamine, and the relative deficiency of dopamine in the basal ganglia is temporarily corrected. Dopamine cannot be used as a medicine since it will not cross the blood–brain barrier and get into the brain. Medications that contain levodopa are very effective treatments for the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease."
"They relieve symptoms very quickly, but the effects typically wear off in a few hours. Dopamine agonists are used in Parkinson’s disease, and anticholinergic medicines are also sometimes used. However, none of these medicines alters the underlying pathology of the disease."
"They only reduce symptoms. A 45-year-old white female complains of back pain, and weakness and numbness of both legs. The back pain started about a month ago and the other symptoms began 1 week ago as slight imbalance, tingling feet, and “funny” sensations around her abdomen."
"This has rapidly progressed to the point where she can no longer walk by herself, she burned her leg in the bathtub because she could not feel that the water was too hot, and today she had an episode of urinary incontinence. Sensation seems reduced or altered from her toes all the way up to her chest. The weakness and numbness are in both legs but worse on the left."
"The arms are normal. Her back pain is in the middle of her back, over the spine, as opposed to the much more common lower back pain. Exam shows moderate to severe weakness in both legs, which is worse on the right."
"Arm strength is normal. Pinprick sensation and touch are reduced bilaterally in the legs and abdomen, up to a fairly distinct level at the nipple line. Percussion of the back shows tenderness over the spine in the upper thoracic region."
"Reflexes at the knees and ankles are pathologically brisk, and Babinski responses are present bilaterally. Reflexes in the arms are normal. The patient cannot walk without assistance."
"The spinal cord, the grayish-white oblong cylindrical continuation of the medulla oblongata of the brain, begins at the foramen magnum of the skull and extends within the vertebral canal to terminate as the cone-shaped conus medullaris. In the adult the caudal tip of the conus medullaris is located between vertebral levels L1 and L2. Thus, the adult spinal cord is approximately 45 cm in length with an average diameter of 1–1."
"5 cm and an average weight of about 30 g. The spinal cord is a soft, gelatinous substance that is protected from injury by being encased in the bony spinal column. Additional protection is provided by the meninges, composed of the three concentric sheaths: the dura matter, arachnoid, and pia mater."
"There is only a potential space between the outermost dura and the arachnoid, known as the subdural space, but the subarachnoid space, located between the arachnoid and pia, is filled with cerebrospinal fluid . The meninges surround the entire spinal cord and, in turn, are enveloped by epidural fat and a venous plexus. Along its length, the lateral aspect of the spinal cord is affixed by about 21 pairs of denticulate ligaments  to the dura mater."
"The spinal cord is a two-way conduit to and from the brain. It functions as a central relay station, receiving incoming information from the body and the brain, and as a central processing station, conveying outgoing information to the body and the brain. The circumference of the spinal cord varies along its length."
"It presents two regions of thickening—the cervical enlargement  and the lumbar enlargement —the origins of the spinal nerves destined for the upper and lower limbs, respectively. Each spinal nerve emanates from the spinal cord as dorsal and ventral rootlets, which eventually join within the intervertebral foramen to form that particular spinal nerve. The spinal cord equals the length of the vertebral canal only until the end of the first trimester of prenatal life."
"Thereafter the trunk elongates much faster, so that by the time of birth the conus medullaris is only at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and in the adult it extends only as far as the caudal aspect of the first lumbar vertebra. Therefore, lower levels of the spinal cord segments are displaced rostrally in relation to their corresponding vertebral levels . Because of this differential growth, the subarachnoid space caudal to the conus medullaris, known as the lumbar cistern, is devoid of spinal cord ."
"As the dorsal and ventral rootlets of the lumbar and sacral segments elongate, they descend various distances and form a loose conglomeration of nerve fibers within the lumbar cistern. Since these fibers resemble a horse’s tail, they are known as the cauda equina. Moreover, the pial covering of the spinal cord continues beyond the conus medullaris as a thin, non-nervous filament, the filum terminale, to the 2nd sacral vertebra where it is covered by the continuation of the dura and arachnoid and is anchored into the 1st coccygeal vertebral segment."
"The CSF, by filling the subarachnoid space, surrounds, suspends, and thus further protects, the spinal cord from possible mechanical injury. Since the spinal cord of the adult occupies only the upper two-thirds of the spinal column, the lumbar cistern is a CSFfilled chamber that is accessible for spinal taps, avoiding damage to the spinal cord . The CSF-filled central canal of the spinal cord is continuous rostrally with the fourth ventricle of the brain and extends along the entire length of the cord, terminating within the filum terminale in the young adult and just rostral to the conus medullaris by the fourth decade of life."
"Frequently the central canal is partially occluded by ependymal cells. The spinal cord possesses a bilateral symmetry, and the ordered presence of the anterior median fissure and the posterior median sulcus aid in the recognition of this symmetry. The ventral  median fissure is about 3 mm deep and extends along the entire anterior  length of the spinal cord."
"The dorsal  median sulcus is not as deep as its anterior counterpart, but it also occupies the entire posterior  length of the spinal cord. It is interesting to note that a glial septum, the dorsal  median septum, is continuous with the deep aspect of the posterior median sulcus, and assists in separating the spinal cord into the right and left halves . Approximately 2 mm on either side of the dorsal median sulcus is the dorsolateral  sulcus, distinguished by the presence of the dorsal rootlets of the spinal nerves as they penetrate the substance of the spinal cord, that extends the entire length of the spinal cord."
"The dorsointermediate sulcus, located between the posterior median and posterolateral sulci, is present only at the cervical and upper thoracic levels. The ventral rootlets of the spinal nerves emerge at the ventrolateral  sulcus, between the posterolateral sulcus and the anterior median fissure. The segmental design of the spinal cord is displayed by the presence of 31 pairs of spinal nerves and their associated dorsal root ganglia."
"Each spinal nerve emanates from the spinal cord as a number of sensory and motor rootlets, leaving the spinal cord’s dorsal and ventral surfaces, respectively. Each rootlet is composed of processes of a large number of neurons. The ventral rootlets, usually no more than eight in number, are seen to join to form a single ventral root, housing the axons of motor  neurons."
"The dorsal rootlets, also no more than eight in number, join and enter the slight swelling, known as the dorsal root ganglion housing the unipolar nerve cell bodies. These dorsal rootlets thus contain the central processes of these unipolar cells. The peripheral processes of the unipolar cells, which bring sensory information from sensory receptors distributed throughout the body, leave the dorsal root ganglion to join the ventral root of the same segment to form the mixed spinal nerve, which thus contains both sensory and motor fibers."
"Each spinal nerve leaves the vertebral column via its intervertebral foramen and is named accordingly. The first eight spinal nerves, C1–C8, exit the vertebral canal abovethe correspondingly numbered cervical vertebrae, whereas all subsequent spinal nerves  exit below the correspondingly named vertebrae . Hence there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves emerging from the spinal cord."
"The region of the spinal cord associated with a particular pair of spinal nerves is called a spinal segment. Spinal nerves are only a few millimeters in length. They give rise to a slender recurrent meningeal branch and then branch into two components, a smaller dorsal primary ramus and a larger ventral primary ramus."
"Every ventral primary ramus receives a gray ramus communicans from its corresponding sympathetic chain ganglion. Additionally, each ventral primary ramus from T1 through L2,3 also provides a white ramus communicans to its corresponding sympathetic chain ganglion . These connecting branches carry postganglionic and preganglionic sympathetic fibers from and to the sympathetic chain ganglia, respectively."
"White rami communicantes have myelinated fibers, whereas gray rami communicantes house nonmyelinated fibers. Additionally, ventral primary rami S1–S3 also provide spinal preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that pass directly to their site of destination. Sensory innervation of the skin is determined by its developmental origin, and the strip of skin for which a particular spinal nerve is responsible is referred to as a dermatome."
"Along the length of the trunk, each dermatome forms an ordered series of bands, whereas along the limbs the ordering is not as evident. These bands overlap each other, since the sensory nerves of one dermatome are also responsible for innervating regions of adjacent dermatomes . It is interesting to note that the overlap is greater for light touch than for pain."
"Clinicians should remember the distribution of certain dermatomes . Additionally, all of the muscle cells that are innervated by the fibers of a particular spinal nerve are referred to as a myotome. Furthermore, a sclerotome is defined as the ligaments and bones that receive their innervation from the fibers of the same spinal nerve."
"Neurons are classified by function into three categories: sensory , intercalated , and motor . The afferent and efferent components are further categorized into more specific divisions, namely somatic and visceral. Thus, a typical spinal nerve has four functional components, known as modalities: the general somatic afferent , general visceral afferent , general somatic efferent , and general visceral efferent  components."
"Cell bodies of the afferent fibers of a spinal nerve reside in the dorsal root ganglia, whereas the cell bodies of the efferent fibers are located within the gray matter of the spinal cord. Visceral efferent neurons belong to the autonomic nervous system and they may be part of its sympathetic or parasympathetic component. The cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic visceral efferent fibers are located in the lateral gray column of the T1 through L2,3 levels of the spinal cord."
"The cell bodies of the preganglionic parasympathetic visceral efferent fibers are located in the lateral gray column of sacral spinal levels 2–4. The cell bodies of visceral afferent neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia. Their peripheral processes bring information from the viscera, using white rami communicantes to enter the spinal nerve."
"The central process of the visceral afferent neuron uses the dorsal rootlets to enter the substance of the spinal cord. Once there it will either complete a reflex path by synapsing with sympathetic or somatic efferent neurons, usually by way of an interneuron, or will synapse with other neurons in the spinal cord or brainstem to deliver the information to higher centers. General somatic afferent is sensory information, such as touch, pressure, pain, temperature, and proprioception, that is perceived in the body and is transmitted to the spinal cord."
"General visceral afferent is sensory information that is perceived in the viscera—the organs, glands, and membranes— that is transmitted to the spinal cord. The general somatic efferent fibers provide motor innervation to skeletal muscles of somatic origin. The general visceral efferent fibers provide motor innervation to the glands, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle."
"The nerve fibers constituting the spinal nerve are subdivided into two categories, afferent  and efferent . All afferent fibers enter the spinal cord via the dorsal rootlets and all efferent fibers leave the spinal cord via the ventral rootlets. Afferent fibers are classified according to their peak conduction velocities."
"Unfortunately there are two classifications commonly in use, one using Roman numerals I–IV and a second using the letters A, B, and C, but they are easily reconciled, as evident in Table 5. 3. Efferent fibers are also classified as A, B, and C fibers as well as by a different system utilizing the Greek letters alpha  and gamma ."
"Furthermore, they are also classified according to their modality, into GSE and GVE fibers. The spinal cord is composed of a column of gray matter surrounded by a sheath of white matter. Gray matter is composed of neurons, their processes, and neuroglia."
"It is the large number of nerve cell bodies that is responsible for the grayish appearance of the gray matter. White matter is composed of myelinated and unmyelinated processes of neurons, neuroglia, and blood vessels, and it is the white coloration of the myelin that gives white matter its name. Inspection of cross-sections of the spinal cord displays a bilateral symmetry."
"The gray matter is arranged in the shape of a butterfly and the appearance of this image, as well as the ratio of white matter to gray matter, vary with level of the segment being examined. The cross-sectional area of gray matter is largest in the mid to low cervical and mid to lower lumbar levels, which are the regions of the spinal cord responsible for the neural supply of the upper and lower limbs, respectively. The region of the spinal cord that displays the least area of gray matter is at the thoracic level."
"The cross-sectional area of the white matter is greatest at the cervical level and smallest at the sacral level of the spinal cord, since the total number of ascending and descending nerve fibers increase in a rostral direction. Because of these characteristics the segmental level of a crosssection of the spinal cord can easily be distinguished. It is interesting to note that generally speaking the processes of the neurons run parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord in white matter, but perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord in gray matter."
"During examination of a cross-section of the gray matter it becomes evident that the two “wings” of the butterfly-shaped gray matter are connected to each other by a narrow strip of gray matter, known as the gray commissure, the center of which is occupied by the central canal. Viewed in three dimensions, the lateral aspect of the gray matter is concave and displays a ventral  gray column and a dorsal  gray column, as well as a small projection, the lateral  gray column, which appears only between spinal cord levels T1 and L2,3 . The lateral gray column represents the location of the cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons."
"It should be noted that these three columns are also referred to as the anterior , posterior , and lateral horns when the spinal cord is examined in cross-sections, and therefore these terms are frequently used interchangeably. Although the gray matter is completely surrounded by white matter, the dorsal horn approaches the limit of the spinal cord and is separated from the dorsolateral sulcus by a small bundle of nerve fibers, known as the dorsolateral tract . The narrow region of the dorsal horn in contact with the dorsolateral tract is subdivided into two regions, the outer dorsomarginal nucleus and the somewhat deeper situated substantia gelatinosa."
"The interface between the gray matter and white matter is usually well defined, but at cervical levels the base of the anterior gray column forms network-like interdigitations with the adjoining white matter. This interwoven structure, known as the reticular formation, is similar to other regions present in the brain and caudal spinal cord levels and thus is part of the reticular system, discussed later in this book . The central canal of the spinal cord contains CSF and is lined by ciliated cuboidal to columnar epithelium composed of ependymal cells."
"In some regions the canal may be partially or completely occluded by clusters of ependymal cells. Immediately surrounding the ependymal cells is the substantia gelatinosa centralis, a layer of neuroglia interspersed with occasional nerve cell bodies and fine nerve fibers. The remainder of gray matter surrounding the substantia gelatinosa centralis is referred to as the gray commissure."
"The white matter surrounding the gray commissure is called the anterior and posterior white commissure. Much of the gray matter is composed of an intricate network of neuronal processes. These may be the central processes of unipolar neurons, the initial segments of motoneurons , axons that are crossing over from one side of the spinal cord to the other, as well as the highly complex and not well understood neuropil."
"The latter is composed of nerve fibers whose extent is limited to the gray matter. Neurons of the spinal cord gray matter are multipolar and are collected in various sized clusters, which, for the sake of convenience, are described as belonging to the dorsal gray column, lateral gray column, or ventral gray column. The gray matter of the spinal cord can be organized into nine layers plus the region surrounding the central canal, named Rexed laminae I–X, after the Swedish neuroanatomist who mapped out their distribution."
"These laminae are numbered in a dorsoventral direction, and generally correspond to the nerve cell clusters in the three columns . The nuclei of the dorsal gray column function in the reception and processing of sensory input from the central processes of the unipolar neurons whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia. These nerve cells are subdivided into four groups: the dorsomarginal nucleus, substantia gelatinosa, nucleus proprius, and nucleus dorsalis."
"The dorsomarginal nucleus  extends the entire length of the spinal cord, capping the dorsal horn, and receives afferent fibers carrying pain, temperature, and light touch sensations. It also contributes fibers for the lateral and ventral spinothalamic tracts. It contacts the dorsolateral tract of Lissauer of the white matter."
"The substantia gelatinosa of Rolando  extends the entire length of the spinal cord. It is densely packed with Golgi type II neurons, known as gelatinosa cells, that possess highly branched, unmyelinated axons. These cells receive sensory input from the central fibers of unipolar neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, delivering pain, temperature, and light touch information."
"Descending fibers from higher centers  form excitatory and inhibitory synapses with the gelatinosa cells, thus modifying the arriving pain and temperature sensations. The nucleus proprius  extends the entire length of the spinal cord. It is composed of densely clustered large nerve cell bodies, located just ventral to the substantia gelatinosa, and receives the central processes of the majority of the unipolar neurons of the dorsal root ganglia."
"The nucleus proprius receives pain, light touch, and temperature sensations and provides input to the lateral and ventral spinothalamic tracts. The nucleus dorsalis, also known as Clarke’s column  extends from C8 to L3. It is located at the base of the dorsal gray column and houses relatively large cell bodies that receive synapses from proprioceptive fibers, which bring information from Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles."
"Some of the axons of these large nerve cell bodies travel in the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts. The lateral nucleus  is composed of the relatively small multipolar cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic neurons. They are present only between T1 and L2,3, and they send their axons into the ventral root of the spinal cord to enter the sympathetic trunk via the white rami communicantes."
"A similar nucleus, the sacral parasympathetic nucleus, is located at sacral levels 2–4. These preganglionic neurons of the sacral outflow of the parasympathetic nervous system are also considered to belong to Rexed lamina VII. The nuclei of the ventral gray column are large and small multipolar motoneurons whose axons leave the spinal cord via the ventral rootlets."
"The large motoneurons give rise to alpha efferents that supply skeletal muscles with motor innervation, whereas the smaller motoneurons supply gamma efferents to intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles, still others are interneurons. These nerve cells are subdivided into three major groups, medial, central, and lateral. The medial group  extends almost the entire length of the spinal cord ."
"Between T1 and L4 it is subdivided into two components, the dorsomedial and ventromedial groups. The motoneurons of the medial group provide innervation for the skeletal muscles of the abdomen, the intercostal muscles, and the muscles of the neck. The central group  is the smallest of the three groups and its distribution is not very extensive."
"The central group is present only in the cervical and lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord. Two regions of the cervical aspect of the central group have special names, the phrenic nucleus and the accessory nucleus. The phrenic nucleus  is responsible for the innervation of the diaphragm and the accessory nucleus  is responsible for innervation of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles."
Cells of the accessory nucleus provide fibers for the spinal root of cranial nerve XI . The lumbosacral aspect of the central group  is known as the lumbosacral group and its function is not known. The lateral group  is present only in the regions of the spinal cord responsible for the motor innervation of the upper and lower extremities .
The gray matter that surrounds the central canal of the spinal cord is known as the gray commissure  and the substantia gelatinosa centralis . The gray commissure is subdivided into a posterior gray commissure and an anterior gray commissure by the central canal. The gray commissures and the substantia gelatinosa centralis extend the entire length of the spinal cord and are believed to be associated with the autonomic nervous system.
The white matter of the spinal cord is also bilaterally symmetric. It surrounds the gray matter and is composed mostly of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. It has two main functions: 1 To bring information into the central nervous system  and transmit it to higher levels.
"2 To transmit information from the higher levels to the spinal cord and to muscles and glands. Based on the presence of sulci and fissures, the white matter is subdivided into three major columns: the dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi . The dorsal funiculus is bounded by the dorsal median and dorsolateral sulci; hence, it is between the dorsal midline and the dorsal nerve rootlets."
"The lateral funiculus is between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral sulci; hence it is between the dorsal and ventral rootlets. The ventral funiculus is between the ventrolateral sulcus and the ventral median fissure, that is the ventral rootlets and the ventral midline. The cervical and upper thoracic aspects of the dorsal funiculus  is further subdivided by the dorsal intermediate sulcus and septum into a medial fasciculus gracilis and a lateral fasciculus cuneatus."
"Moreover, the ventral funiculus houses the ventral white commissure, the region of decussation for the spinothalamic tracts. Within the funiculi, the nerve fibers that have similar destinations are arranged in bundles known as tracts . Some of these fiber bundles, especially in the dorsal funiculus, are clearly defined into well recognizable tracts that are separated from each other by glial sheaths, whereas most tracts appear to have overlapping boundaries."
"Tracts are classified into three categories, ascending, descending, and intersegmental. Ascending tracts transmit sensory information to higher centers, whereas descending tracts relay motor information originating at higher centers. The intersegmental tracts convey information between spinal cord segments, thus orchestrating intersegmental spinal reflexes."
"Although these tracts will be discussed in detail in later chapters of this book, the positions of these tracts are indicated in the transverse section of the spinal cord in Figure and Table. The anterior spinal arteries, direct branches of the vertebral arteries, join with each other to form a single median vessel, the anterior spinal artery, which occupies  and follows the ventral median fissure of the spinal cord. This vessel extends from within the cranial cavity throughout the entire length of the spinal cord and provides small branches that penetrate and supply the white and gray matter of the spinal cord."
"The anterior spinal artery may be quite small in the thoracic region . The posterior spinal arteries also arise from the vertebral arteries directly or frequently indirectly by way of the inferior cerebellar branch of the vertebral artery. Each posterior spinal artery bifurcates to form two longitudinal vessels that extend from within the cranial cavity throughout the entire length of the spinal cord, sandwiching the dorsal rootlets between them."
"These three vessels provide small branches that penetrate and serve the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. The 32 pairs of radicular arteries are small vessels that arise from arteries in the immediate vicinity of the spinal column. Each radicular artery enters the intervertebral foramen where it bifurcates, forming an anterior and a posterior radicular artery, which follow the ventral and dorsal roots, respectively, to gain entrance into the vertebral canal."
"The anterior and posterior radicular arteries anastomose with branches of the anterior and posterior spinal arteries on the surface of the spinal cord, and arborize to supply the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. It should be stressed that the radicular arteries are extremely important for the vascularization of the spinal cord, because, with the exception of the cervical region, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries by themselves are unable to provide an adequate vascular supply to the spinal cord. Therefore, an injury to the spinal nerve damages not only the afferent and efferent fibers of a particular spinal cord level, but may also damage the segmental white and gray matter by producing ischemic conditions due to the reduction in blood supply from the radicular artery serving that region."
"It should be noted that the great ventral radicular artery  is the largest, albeit inconsistent, of the radicular arteries . It usually arises on the left-hand side and serves much of the inferior half of the spinal cord, entering the vertebral canal between L2 and L3, and contributes to the formation of the inferior aspect of the ventral spinal artery. Several longitudinally arranged tortuous veins of the pia mater are responsible for the venous drainage of the spinal cord."
These are the ventral and dorsal spinal veins that communicate with the segmentally arranged radicular veins. The radicular veins follow the paths of their companion radicular arteries to leave the vertebral canal via the intervertebral foramina. Along the way they also communicate with the epidural venous network embedded in the epidural fat of the vertebral canal.
"The epidural venous network delivers its blood into the cavernous sinus of the cranial cavity. Cranially, the ventral and dorsal spinal veins drain into the veins and venous sinuses of the cranial cavity. Syringomyelia is a spinal cord disorder marked by the loss of the sense of temperature and pain at levels involving several consecutive spinal cord segments."
"Frequently, the other senses, such as touch and pressure, are unaffected and then a dissociated anesthesia is said to be present. A number of conditions may cause this disorder, including the presence of a cleft within the spinal cord as well as an anomalous increase in the size of the central canal of the spinal cord. Spinal shock occurs infrequently and is characterized by complete anesthesia and paralysis, including the absence of all reflexes, somatic or autonomic, involving the body segments caudal to the site of damage."
"This condition may be permanent if the spinal cord is transected or of temporary duration if the spinal cord receives a sudden, but transient, injury, such as an unusually high dose of spinal anesthesia. Tabes dorsalis is a late stage effect of syphilis, arising about 10–20 years after the disease was contracted. The condition is characterized by infection of the dorsal column and dorsal roots causing sudden, sharp, shooting pain in the lower extremities."
"Occasionally, the condition is accompanied by ulceration of the feet, violent stomach cramps, and deterioration of the joints. Brown-Séquard’s syndrome is the result of unilateral spinal cord lesions characterized by contralateral pain and temperature loss and ipsilateral weakness and loss of proprioception. Ependymomas are tumors involving usually the caudal end of the spinal cord and the filum terminale."
"The unchecked cell division of the ependymal cells results in the presence of small to medium-sized growth in the affected area. These cells produce large quantities of proteins that elevate the protein levels in the CSF with a consequent reduction in the ability of the arachnoid granulations to deliver CSF into the lacunae lateralis/superior sagittal sinus. Therefore, the patient begins to suffer from hydrocephalus with headaches, and MRI examinations display the presence of enlarged cerebral ventricles."
"Spina bifida is a prenatally acquired developmental defect of incomplete fusion of one or more vertebral arches along with the incomplete fusion of the lips of the neural tube. It is a relatively frequent anomaly, whose incidence is about 1–2% of all births. The subtypes of spina bifida depend on the severity of the lack of fusion."
"The most common ones are spina bifida anterior, spina bifida cystica, and spina bifida occulta. Spina bifida anterior occurs along the ventral surface of the vertebral column. This incomplete closure of the vertebrae is often accompanied by anomalous development of the thoracic and abdominal viscera."
"Spina bifida cystica  is a more serious defect involving herniation of the spinal cord  and/or of the meninges  through the congenital defect in the vertebral column. The meningocele and myelocele may protrude far enough to reach the skin and may even rupture the skin with subsequent leakage of CSF and the possibility of bacterial infection resulting in meningitis. Spina bifida occulta is the most common of the spina bifida cases, being present in about 5% of the population."
This is the mildest form of spina bifida and may not even be symptomatic. In cases like this the patient may even be unaware of the defect until for other reasons radiographs or MRI are taken of the region of the defect. Then it appears as an osseous defect without the accompanying herniation of the spinal cord or of the meninges.
"Frequently, the site of the defect is apparent on the overlying skin by the presence of a tuft of hair and/or of a dimple over the region of the osseous lesion. This patient has an acute myelopathy, meaning spinal cord pathology, which in this case seems to be in the upper thoracic region. This is located at T4 or above, but not below."
"The sensory level makes that very clear. The location of the back pain is also consistent. The brisk reflexes and Babinski response  point to a CNS cause, as opposed to a peripheral nervous system cause."
"Bilateral weakness in the legs, and not the arms, also makes a thoracic cord pathology most likely. A lesion in the brain that causes leg weakness rarely leaves the arm or face unaffected, and is almost always unilateral . This case represents a neurologic emergency."
"She should be admitted to the hospital without delay. The cause is not immediately clear, but the acute onset and rapid progression mandate immediate action. Work-up would include imaging of the thoracic spine, preferably with MRI."
This would almost certainly reveal the pathology; probably in this case a mass of some sort. The mass would have to be rapidly growing and the rapid deterioration and back tenderness indicates that the mass is most likely extra-axial . This could either be intradural or extradural.
"These types of masses can cause vascular compromise as well as physical compression of the cord. Some causes of extra-axial masses include metastatic tumors , primary tumors , epidural abscess, vascular malformations, or hemorrhage. Compression from vertebral fracture or intervertebral disc herniation can look similar."
Treatment for any of these is surgical removal of the offending mass. A 28-year-old man was struck in the back of the head by a steel beam while at work. He apparently lost consciousness for approximately 30 minutes.
"He was hospitalized since he was still confused and disoriented throughout his stay in the emergency room. By the next day he was felt to be back to normal except for a headache and was discharged. The patient had no memory of the event, and he had no memory of an important conversation he had had with his boss 5 minutes before the head trauma."
"He also had no memory of being in the emergency room and no memories of events subsequent to the injury until the next day. He also noted, besides persistent headache, that he was somewhat forgetful since the injury. Neurologic examination was unremarkable."
"The brain, a bilaterally symmetric, soft, gelatinous structure surrounded by its meninges and enclosed in its bony cranium, is continuous with the spinal cord at the foramen magnum at the base of the skull. At birth the brain weighs less than 400 g, but by the beginning of the second year of life it has more than doubled in weight to 900 g. The adult brain weighs between 1,250 and 1,450 g, and demonstrates a gender differential, since brains of males generally weigh more than those of females."
"This statement, however, should be tempered by the evidence that, in adults, the ratio of brain to body weight is greater in females than in males and that the increase in weight is due more to the proliferation of neuroglia than to the mitotic activity of neurons. An additional point of interest is that there does not appear to be a relationship between brain weight and intelligence. As detailed in Chapter 2, it is evident during embryogenesis that the brain is subdivided into five continuous regions, from rostral to caudal: the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon."
"As the brain grows in size and complexity, these regions fold upon and over one another, so that in the adult the evidence of these subdivisions is no longer clearly apparent. The present chapter will not discuss the functional aspects of the brain; instead its basic morphology and architecture. are detailed to provide an anatomical framework of reference for the chapters that follow, and many of the major topics introduced in this chapter are discussed in further detail in specific chapters in this textbook."
"Much of this terminology should be memorized so that when, in later chapters, functional connections among regions of the brain are discussed the student has a visual image of the location of the various structures and the pathways the connections take. If the adult brain is viewed in three dimensions, only three regions are clearly visible, and these are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and part of the brainstem. The cerebral hemispheres are narrower posteriorly, at the occipital pole, than anteriorly, at the frontal pole."
"They are large, oval structures that superficially resemble the surface of a shelled walnut . The midline longitudinal cerebral fissure, occupied in life by the falx cerebri, incompletely separates the two cerebral hemispheres from one another. The floor of the cerebral fissure is formed by the corpus callosum, a large myelinated fiber tract that forms an anatomical and functional connection between the right and left hemispheres."
"The surface few millimeters of the cerebral hemisphere are composed of a highly folded collection of gray matter, known as the cerebral cortex. This folding increases the surface area and presents elevations, gyri, and depressions, sulci. Deep to the cortex is a central core of white matter that forms the bulk of the cerebrum and represents fiber tracts, supported by neuroglia, ferrying information destined for the cortex and cortical responses to other regions of the central nervous system ."
"Buried within the mass of white matter are collections of neuron cell bodies, some of which are lumped together under the rubric of basal ganglia, even though, technically, they are nuclei. Large collections of gray matter are also present in the diencephalons, namely, the epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and subthalamus. The cerebrum is a hollow structure and the cavities within the cerebral hemispheres are called the right and left lateral ventricles, which communicate with the third ventricle via the interventricular foramen  ."
"The two lateral ventricles are separated from one another by two closely adjoined non-nervous membranes, each known as a septum pellucidum. Ependymal cells line each lateral ventricle, and protruding into each ventricle is a choroid plexus that functions in the manufacture of cerebrospinal fluid. Each cerebral hemisphere is subdivided into five lobes: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, and the insula ."
"Additionally, the cortical constituents of the limbic system are also considered to be a region of the cerebral hemisphere and some consider it to be the sixth lobe, the limbic lobe. Viewed from the side, each cerebral hemisphere resembles the shape of a boxing glove, where the thumb is the temporal lobe and is separated from the parietal lobe by the lateral fissure  . The floor of the lateral fissure is formed by the insula  that is hidden by the frontal, parietal, and temporal opercula , regions of the same named lobes."
"Although the geographic distributions of many of the sulci and gyri are relatively inconsistent, some regularly occupy specific locations, are recognizable in most brains, and are named. The sulci are generally smaller and shallower than the fissures, and one of these, the central sulcus , separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. The division between the parietal and occipital lobes is not readily evident when viewed from the lateral aspect because it is defined as the imaginary line between the preoccipital notch and the parieto-occipital notch."
"However, it is clearly delimited on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere, where the boundary between these two structures is the parieto-occipital sulcus and its continuation, the calcarine fissure . On its lateral aspect, the frontal lobe extends from the frontal pole to the central sulcus, constituting the anterior one-third of the cerebral cortex. Its posteriormost gyrus, the precentral gyrus, consists of the primary motor area and is bordered anteriorly by the precentral sulcus and posteriorly by the central sulcus."
"The region of the frontal lobe located anterior to the precentral sulcus is subdivided into the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri. This subdivision is due to the presence, though inconsistent, of two longitudinally disposed sulci, the superior and inferior frontal sulci. The inferior frontal gyrus is demarcated by extensions of the lateral fissure into three subregions: the pars triangularis, pars opercularis, and pars orbitalis."
"In the dominant hemisphere, a region of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Broca’s area, which functions in the production of speech. On its inferior aspect, the frontal lobe presents the longitudinally disposed olfactory sulcus. Medial to this sulcus is the gyrus rectus , and lateral to it are the orbital gyri."
"The olfactory sulcus is partly occupied by the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract . At its posterior extent, the olfactory tract bifurcates to form the lateral and medial olfactory striae. The intervening area between the two striae is triangular in shape and is known as the olfactory trigone and it abuts the anterior perforated substance."
"On its medial aspect, the frontal lobe is bordered by the arched cingulate sulcus, which forms the boundary of the superior aspect of the cingulate gyrus. The quadrangular-shaped cortical tissue anterior to the central sulcus is a continuation of the precentral gyrus and is known as the anterior paracentral lobule. The parietal lobe is interposed between the frontal and occipital lobes and is situated above the temporal lobe."
"On its lateral aspect, its anteriormost gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, is the primary somesthetic area to which primary somatosensory information is channeled from the contralateral half of the body. The remainder of the parietal lobe, separated from the postcentral gyrus by the postcentral sulcus, is subdivided by the inconsistent intraparietal sulcus, into the superior and inferior parietal lobules. The former is an association area involved in somatosensory function, whereas the latter is separated into the supramarginal gyrus, which integrates auditory, visual, and somatosensory information, and the angular gyrus, which receives visual input."
"On its medial aspect, the parietal lobe is separated from the occipital lobe by the parieto-occipital sulcus and its inferior continuation, the calcarine fissure. This region of the parietal lobe is subdivided into two major structures, the anteriorly positioned posterior paracentral lobule  and the posteriorly situated precuneus. The temporal lobe is separated from the frontal and parietal lobes by the lateral fissure and from the occipital lobe by an imaginary plane that passes through the parieto-occipital sulcus."
"The anteriormost aspect of the temporal lobe is known as the temporal pole. On its lateral aspect, the temporal lobe exhibits three parallel gyri, the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri, separated from each other by the inconsistently present superior and middle temporal sulci. The superior temporal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere contains Wernicke’s area, which is responsible for the individual’s ability to speak and understand the spoken and written word."
"Hidden within the lateral fissure is the superior aspect of the temporal lobe whose surface is marked by the obliquely running transverse temporal gyri , the primary auditory cortex. The inferior aspect of the temporal lobe is grooved by the inferior temporal sulcus that is interposed between the inferior temporal gyrus and the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus . The collateral sulcus separates the fusiform gyrus from the parahippocampal gyrus of the limbic lobe."
"The occipital lobe extends from the occipital pole to the parieto-occipital sulcus. On its lateral aspect, the occipital lobe presents the superior and inferior occipital gyri, separated from each other by the horizontally running lateral occipital sulcus. On its medial aspect, the occipital lobe is subdivided into the superiorly located cuneate gyrus  and the inferiorly positioned lingual gyrus, separated from each other by the calcarine fissure."
"The cortical tissue on each bank of this fissure is known collectively as the striate cortex , and forms the primary visual cortex. In order to view the insula the frontal, temporal, and parietal opercula have to be pulled apart, since this lobe is submerged within and forms the floor of the lateral sulcus. It is completely circumscribed by the circular sulcus."
"The lateral surface of the insula is subdivided into several short and long gyri, the most prominent of which is located posteriorly. The insula is believed to be associated with taste, and perhaps other visceral functions. The limbic lobe is a complex region and includes the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampal formation, subcallosal gyrus, parolfactory gyrus, and the preterminal gyrus."
"The following description is a view of the medial aspect of the hemisected brain and the various regions of the corpus callosum are obvious landmarks. Therefore, the corpus callosum will now be described, even though it is not a part of the limbic lobe. The anterior extent of the corpus callosum, known as the genu, bends inferiorly and turns posteriorly, where it forms a slender connection, the rostrum, with the anterior commissure."
"The posterior extent of the corpus callosum is bulbous in shape, and is known as the splenium . The cingulate gyrus is located above the corpus callosum and is separated from it by the callossal sulcus. As the cingulate gyrus continues posteriorly, it follows the curvature of the corpus callosum and dips beneath the splenium to continue anteriorly as the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus."
"The anterior continuation of the isthmus is the parahippocampal gyrus whose anteriormost extent is known as the uncus. Above the parahippocampal gyrus is the hippocampal sulcus, which separates the parahippocampal gyrus from the hippocampal formation . Just beneath the rostrum of the corpus callosum is the subcallosal gyrus."
"The connection between the anterior commissure and the optic chiasma is the lamina terminalis and the cortical tissue anterior to the lamina terminalis is the parolfactory gyrus and preterminal gyrus. The subcallosal, parolfactory, and preterminal gyri are referred to as the subcallosal area. The best accepted system of functional regionalization of the cerebral cortex was developed by the neuroanatomist, K."
"Brodmann, who in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries mapped the cortex into 47 unique areas, each associated with specific morphological characteristics. Although later investigators refined and expanded his map into more than 200 areas and assigned functional characteristics to them, Brodmann’s original classification is still widely used. The major areas, their location, and function are presented in Table ."
"The cerebral cortex is well endowed with neurons, neuroglia, nerve fibers, and a rich vascular supply. The arrangement of the three types of neurons that populate the cortex—pyramidal cells, stellate neurons, and fusiform neurons—permit the classification of the cortex into three types: the archicortex , mesocortex , and neocortex . The archicortex, phylogenetically the oldest region, is composed of only three layers and is located in the limbic system."
"The mesocortex, phylogenetically younger, is composed of three to six layers, and is located predominantly in the insula and cingulate gyrus. The neocortex, phylogenetically the youngest region of the cerebral cortex, is composed of six layers and comprises the bulk of the cerebral cortex. Although the cerebral cortex is arranged in layers, superimposed upon this cytoarchitecture is a functional organization of cell columns."
"Each cell column is less than 0. 1 mm in diameter, is perpendicular to the superficial surface of the cortex, passes through each of the six cortical layers, and is composed of neurons with similar functions. All neurons of a single column respond to like stimuli from the same region of the body."
"The organization of the six layers of the neocortex is known as its cytoarchitecture, where each layer has a name and an associated Roman numeral . The central core of white matter that forms the substance of the cerebrum is composed of myelinated nerve fibers of varied sizes and their supporting neuroglia. These fibers may be classified into the following three categories: commissural, projection, and association fibers."
"Commissural fibers  interconnect the right and left cerebral hemispheres. There are four bundles of commissural fibers, the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, posterior commissure, and hippocampal commissure . The largest group of the commissural fibers, the corpus callosum, is comprised of four regions: the anteriormost rostrum, the curved genu, the relatively flattened body, and its posteriormost region, the splenium."
"The corpus callosum connects the neocortex of the right hemisphere with that of the left. The anterior commissure connects the right and left amygdalas, the olfactory bulbs, and several cortical regions of the two temporal lobes. The posterior commissure connects the right and left pretectal region and related cell groups of the mesencephalon."
"The hippocampal commissure  joins the right and left hippocampi to one another. Projection fibers are restricted to a single hemisphere and connect the cerebral cortex with lower levels, namely the corpus striatum, diencephalon, brainstem, and spinal cord. The majority of these fibers are axons of pyramidal cells and fusiform neurons."
"These fibers are component parts of the internal capsule, which is subdivided into the anterior limb, genu, posterior limb, retrolentiform, and sublentiform regions. The projection fibers may be subdivided into corticopetal and corticofugal fibers. Corticopetal fibers are afferent fibers that bring information from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex."
"They consist of thalamocortical fibers. Corticofugal fibers are efferent fibers that transmit information from the cerebral cortex to lower centers of the brain and spinal cord. They consist of the corticobulbar, corticopontine, corticospinal, and corticothalamic fibers."
"Association fibers, also known as arcuate fibers, are restricted to a single hemisphere and are subdivided into two major categories, short arcuate fibers and long arcuate fibers. They are the axons of pyramidal cells and fusiform neurons. Short arcuate fibers, which connect adjacent gyri, do not usually reach the subcortical white matter of the cerebral cortex; most of them are confined to the cortical gray matter."
"The long arcuate fibers, which connect nonadjacent gyri, consist of the following fiber tracts : the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and fronto-occipital fasciculus. The basal ganglia, called ganglia even though they are nuclei, are large collections of cell bodies that are embedded deep in the white matter of the brain . These soma include those deep nuclei of the brain and brainstem which, when damaged, produce movement disorders."
"Thus the basal ganglia are composed of the caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus , subthalamic nucleus of the ventral thalamus, and the substantia nigra of the mesencephalon . These nuclei have numerous connections with various regions of the CNS; some receive input and are categorized as input nuclei, some project to other regions and are referred to as output nuclei, whereas some receive input, project to other regions of the CNS, and have local interconnections and these are known as intrinsic nuclei. The diencephalon, interposed between the cerebrum and the midbrain, has four regions: the epithalamus, thalamus , hypothalamus, and subthalamus."
"The right and left halves of the diencephalon are separated from one another by a narrow slit-like space, the ependymal-lined third ventricle. Rostrally, the interventricular foramina  leads from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle, whereas caudally, the third ventricle is connected to the fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct . The epithalamus, composed of the pineal body, stria medullaris, and habenular trigone, constitutes the dorsal surface of the diencephalon."
"The right and left thalami compose the bulk of the diencephalon and form the superior aspect of the lateral walls of the third ventricle. The two thalami, structures composed of numerous nuclei, are connected to each other by a bridge of gray matter, the interthalamic adhesion . Some of the nuclei of the thalamus form distinctive bulges on its surface, namely the pulvinar  and the medial and lateral geniculate bodies."
"The boundary between the thalamus and the hypothalamus is marked by a groove, the hypothalamic sulcus, located along the lateral walls of the third ventricle. Structures associated with the hypothalamus are the pituitary gland and its infundibulum, the tuber cinereum, and the two mammillary bodies. The subthalamic nuclei and fiber tract form the subthalamus."
"The cerebellum is located in the posterior aspect of the brain, just below the occipital lobes of the cerebrum . It is separated from the cerebrum via a horizontal dural reflection, the tentorium cerebelli. The cerebellum is connected to the midbrain, pons, and medulla of the brainstem via three pairs of fiber bundles, the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles, respectively."
"Viewing the cerebellum, it can be seen that it is composed of the right and left cerebellar hemispheres and the narrow, intervening vermis. The vermis is also subdivided into a superior and an inferior portion, where the superior portion is visible between the two hemispheres, while its inferior portion is buried between the two hemispheres. The surface of the cerebellum has horizontal elevations, known as folia, and indentations between the folia, known as sulci."
"Some of these sulci are deeper than others and they are said to subdivide each hemisphere into three lobes, the small anterior lobe, the much larger posterior lobe, and the inferiorly positioned flocculonodular lobe . The anterior lobe is separated from the posterior lobe by the primary fissure, and the posterolateral fissure separates the flocculonodular lobe from the posterior lobe . Similar to the cerebrum, the cerebellum has an outer rim of gray matter, the cortex, an inner core of nerve fibers, the medullary white matter, and the deep cerebellar nuclei, located within the white matter."
"The cortex and white matter are easily distinguished from each other in a midsagittal section of the cerebellum, where the white matter arborizes, forming the core of what appears to be a tree-like architecture, known as the arbor vitae. Histologically, the cerebellar cortex is a three-layered structure, the outermost molecular layer, the middle Purkinje layer, and the innermost granular layer. The granular layer is well defined due to the presence of nucleic acids in the nuclei of its numerous, small cells."
"The Purkinje layer, composed of a single layer of large Purkinje cell perikaryons, is also easily recognizable. The molecular layer is rich in axons and dendrites as well as capillaries that penetrate deep into this layer. Four pairs of nuclei are located within the substance of the cerebellar white matter."
"These are the fastigial, dentate, emboliform, and globose nuclei. The connections between the cortical regions and the deep nuclei of the cerebellum permit the subdivision of the cerebellum into three zones— the vermal, paravermal, and hemispheric—where each zone is composed of deep cerebellar nuclei, white matter, and cortex. The brainstem, the oldest part of the CNS, is composed of the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon  ."
"Since these are embryologic terms, one may also state that the brainstem is composed of the mesencephalon, pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. As parts of it have been overgrown by the cerebrum and the cerebellum, its dorsal aspect is mostly hidden from view in the whole brain, whereas its ventral and lateral aspects are visible. Removal of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres exposes the brainstem in its entirety and it is usually examined in that fashion as well as by hemisecting the entire brain."
"The mesencephalon  is a relatively narrow band of the brainstem surrounding the cerebral aqueduct, extending from the diencephalon to the pons. The dorsal aspect of the midbrain is known as the tectum  and incorporates the paired superior and inferior colliculi . These structures are associated with the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, respectively, and they are all associated with visual and auditory functions."
The trochlear nerve  exits the dorsal aspect of the mesencephalon just below the inferior colliculus. All other cranial nerves exit the ventral aspect of the brainstem. The region of the mesencephalon below the cerebral aqueduct is known as the midbrain  tegmentum .
"The cerebral hemispheres are connected to the brainstem by two large fiber tracts, the cerebral peduncles, and the depression between the peduncles is known as the interpeduncular fossa, the site of origin of the oculomotor nerve . The cerebellum overlies and hides the dorsal aspect of the brainstem, but its ventral aspect, the pons, is clearly evident. Rostrally, the superior pontine sulcus acts as the boundary between the metencephalon and the midbrain and the inferior pontine sulcus as the boundary between the metencephalon and the myelencephalon."
"Part of the floor of the fourth ventricle is formed by the dorsal aspect of the pons, and is known as the pontine tegmentum, the structure that houses the nuclei of the trigeminal, abducent, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerves. Cranial nerves VI, VII, and VIII leave the brainstem at the inferior pontine sulcus, whereas the trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem through the middle cerebellar peduncle. The caudal-most portion of the brainstem, the myelencephalon, also known as the medulla oblongata, extends from the inferior pontine sulcus to the spinal cord."
"The boundary between them is the region where the lateral walls of the fourth ventricle converge in a V shape at the midline obex . The ventral surface of the myelencephalon displays the anterior midline fissure, bordered on each side by the pyramids and crossed by the pyramidal decussations, connecting the right and left pyramids to each other. The olives are olivepit-shaped swellings lateral to each pyramid."
"The hypoglossal nerve is evident as a number of thin filaments on each side of the brainstem, arising from the anterior lateral sulcus between the pyramids and olives. The glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves arise from the groove dorsal to the olives. The dorsal surface of the myelencephalon presents the posterior median fissure, which is interposed between the right and left tuberculum gracilis, swellings formed by the nucleus gracilis."
"Just lateral to the tuberculum gracilis is another swelling, the tuberculum cuneatus, a bulge formed by the underlying nucleus cuneatus. The caudal continuation of the tuberculum gracilis is the fasciculus gracilis, and the continuation of the tuberculum cuneatus is the fasciculus cuneatus. Just lateral to the tuberculum cuneatus is another swelling, the tuberculum cinereum, formed by the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve."
A review of the head CT that was performed in the emergency room revealed the extent of the patient’s injuries. There were modest contusions of the bilateral anterior and orbital regions of the frontal lobes and the left anterior temporal lobe. Contusions are brain “bruises.
"” The patient had a concussion, meaning any alteration of consciousness resulting from head trauma. Persistent headache and memory difficulties are often characteristics of “postconcussion syndrome,” which can also include dizziness, poor balance, poor concentration, and other vague symptoms. There are several ways in which head trauma can cause brain injury."
"As in the above case, contusion can result. The locations of these are often predictable. Coup and contrecoup are terms used to define the location of contusion related to the site of head trauma."
A coup injury refers to a contusion that occurs to the part of the brain that directly underlies the site of head trauma. A contrecoup injury refers to a contusion that occurs in parts of the brain directly opposite the site of head trauma. The patient above suffered contrecoup contusions.
The anterior and orbital regions of the frontal lobes and the anterior temporal lobes are the most common locations of contusions. The skull is somewhat rigid and is the first to have contact with the object of injury. There is a very sudden acceleration or deceleration of the skull.
"The brain within is somewhat mobile. As the skull accelerates or decelerates, the brain crashes into the skull at certain points. The damage occurs mostly to those parts of the brain surface that are most angular and also in close proximity to the bones of the skull."
"There are other locations and mechanisms of injury that are often more important, especially in cases where disability or death occur from head trauma. There is also a rotational component to brain movement inside the skull at the moment of impact. This causes shearing stresses, especially to the upper brainstem region, which can damage the reticular system, which maintains consciousness and awareness."
"This is probably the mechanism by which head injury causes loss or alteration of consciousness. Damage to the corpus callosum is also often demonstrated pathologically, secondary to its rotational momentum against the rigid falx. Diffuse axonal injury refers to diffuse damage to white matter, specifically to axons, which has been demonstrated pathologically."
"This is also thought to be due to shearing or stretching injury to the long and thin axons due to sudden and severe rotational and angular stresses. A 23-year-old male comes to the emergency room complaining of 2 days of fever, headache, stiff neck, and general ill feeling. Symptoms have been getting worse over the course of these 2 days."
He notes pain on movement of his eyes and sensitivity to light. His roommate who accompanies him noted he has been somewhat lethargic. Before the onset of the present symptoms he had been quite well.
"He had had no seizure. Upon examination in the ER, he appeared ill and lethargic but easily arousable. He had a fever of 38."
"5°C. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations were normal. With the patient supine the neck was passively flexed."
"The neck was abnormally stiff . At the same time as the neck was flexed, his knees flexed slightly. When eye movement was tested, the patient noted his eyes hurt when they moved."
"Strength, sensation, reflexes, and all other parts of the neurologic and general exams were normal or unremarkable. The central nervous system  is enclosed in the bony cranium and vertebral column. Separating the brain and spinal cord from the calcified tissue are three more or less concentric membranes, the outermost, dense, irregular collagenous connective tissue, the dura mater, also known as the pachymeninx, the middle spiderweb-like arachnoid, and the very flimsy, innermost pia mater."
"The arachnoid and pia mater, together, are also known by the term leptomeninges and are separated from one another by the subarachnoid space. The dura mater forms reflections upon itself, some of which contain dural venous sinuses. The meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord are compared in Table 7."
"1. Cerebrospinal fluid , a clear fluid, manufactured by the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, circulates in the subarachnoid space, the ventricles of the brain, and the central canal of the spinal cord. It is delivered into the lacunae lateralis, and from there into the vascular supply by structures, derived from both the pia mater and arachnoid, known as arachnoid granulations."
"The four ventricles of the brain are fluid-filled, ependymal-lined cavities that are continuous with each other as well as with the central canal of the spinal cord. These spaces are the remnants of the lumen of the embryonic neural tube. Although the dura mater surrounding the brain is continuous with the dura mater surrounding the spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum, it is customary to discuss the two separately."
"The cranial dura mater has two layers , an outer periosteal dura mater that is attached to the internal table of the diploë and acts as a true periosteum, and an internal meningeal dura mater that is in intimate contact with the arachnoid. The periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater are tightly attached to each other throughout much of their extent; however, in certain regions the two layers are separated from each other to form venous channels, known as sinuses. The periosteal dura mater is a coarse type of connective tissue composed of dense irregular collagenous connective tissue interlaced with some elastic fibers."
"It is a very tough, mostly inelastic tissue that is tightly attached to the surrounding bony vault of the skull. It is especially firmly attached at the sutures and to the floor of the cranial cavity. At the foramina of the skull the periosteal dura mater forms a connective tissue sheath around the cranial nerves as they leave the skull and this dural layer is quickly replaced by the epineurium, derived from the extracranial connective tissue."
"At the rim of the foramen magnum the periosteal dura becomes continuous with the periosteum of the vertebral canal. The meningeal layer of the dura is also composed of dense irregular collagenous connective tissue. Its innermost aspect is lined by a single layer of flattened fibroblasts that form an epithelioid sheath that is in direct contact with, and separates the arachnoid from, the collagenous connective tissue component of the meningeal dura."
"The periosteal layer of the dura mater is richly supplied by blood vessels, whereas the meningeal layer has no vascular supply. The blood vessels of the periosteal layer include the middle meningeal and accessory meningeal arteries of the middle cranial fossa, as well as the meningeal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries and meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery of the anterior cranial fossa. Meningeal branches of the vertebral, occipital, middle meningeal, and ascending pharyngeal arteries serve the periosteal dura of the posterior cranial fossa."
"Most of these vessels enter the cranial fossa via foramina and canals of the skull, such as the jugular and mastoid foramina and the hypoglossal canal. Blood is drained from the dura by meningeal veins that empty their blood  into several of the sinuses as well as into nearby emissary veins and diploic veins. The dura mater possesses a very rich sensory nerve supply, derived mostly from cranial nerve V  but also from the first three cervical spinal nerves that serve the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa."
"Sympathetic fibers also reach the dura mater, arising from the vertebral and carotid plexuses, to serve the dural blood vessels. The meningeal layer of the dura mater is responsible for the formation of several folds that serve to separate parts of the brain from one another . These folds are reflections of the meningeal layer of the dura upon itself and are known as the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and falx cerebelli."
"Additionally, the meningeal layer of the dura also forms a diaphragm over the hypophyseal fossa, known as the diaphragma sella, as well as a roof over the trigeminal ganglion, thus forming a shallow compartment known as the cavum trigeminale . The falx cerebri is located in the midline longitudinal cerebral fissure, which separates the right and left cerebral hemisphere from one another. Its narrow anterior aspect is attached to the crista galli and its broader, posterior aspect is attached to the superior surface of the tentorium cerebelli, extending posteriorly as far as the internal occipital protuberance."
"The superior, convex surface of the falx cerebri is attached to the periosteal layer of the dura, leaving only a narrow, endothelially lined channel, the superior sagittal sinus. This sinus is the largest dural venous sinus, which begins just behind the crista galli, at the foramen cecum, and terminates posteriorly at the confluence of sinuses. The inferior surface of the falx cerebri is a free, concave-shaped edge, which contains the inferior sagittal sinus."
"At the junction where the falx cerebri joins and fuses with the tentorium cerebelli is another endothelially lined space, the straight sinus, that receives blood from the inferior sagittal sinus and the great cerebral vein. Blood from the straight sinus also enters the confluence of sinuses. The tentorium cerebelli, a horizontal reflection of the meningeal layer of the dura mater, is interposed between the cerebellum and the occipital lobes of the cerebrum."
"Its anterior sharp concave margin is free, cradling the midbrain. The lateral borders of the tentorium cerebelli extend much farther anteriorly than does its midline . The superior surface of the central region is convex, being highest along the length of the straight sinus."
"The transverse sinuses, endothelially lined vascular spaces, sit in the lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, where this dural reflection is attached to the lips of the grooves for the left and right transverse sinuses of the occipital bone. Anteriorly, the lateral aspect of the tentorium is attached to the superior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and forms endothelially lined spaces, the right and left superior petrosal sinuses, and continues anteriorly to attach to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. The free, medial edge of the tentorium cerebelli crosses over the lateral edge and attaches to the anterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone."
"Because of the separate attachments of the free and attached aspects of the tentorium cerebelli, an oval opening is created in the dura mater. This opening, known as the tentorial incisure, surrounds the midbrain and permits the ascent of the posterior cerebral arteries to reach the cerebral hemispheres. The falx cerebelli, a relatively small reflection of the meningeal layer of the dura folded upon itself, is interposed between the right and left cerebellar hemispheres."
"The posterior border of the falx cerebelli meets the periosteal layer of the dura mater on the internal aspect of the occipital bone, where it is attached along the entire length of the internal occipital crest, and forms the endothelially lined occipital sinuses. The diaphragma sella is a thin reflection of the meningeal layer of the dura mater. Its lateral aspect is attached to the clinoid processes, whereas its central aspect is open, thus forming an incomplete roof over the hypophyseal fossa that is penetrated by the infundibulum of the hypophysis."
"The anterior and posterior edges of the diaphragma sella house the anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses. The cavum trigeminale  is a narrow, slit-like region interposed between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater positioned on the trigeminal impression of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is occupied by the trigeminal ganglion as well as by the sensory and motor roots of the trigeminal nerve."
"There is a potential space between the meningeal layer of the cranial dura mater and the cranial arachnoid , known as the subdural space, that, according to some neuroanatomists, is occupied by an extremely thin film of fluid. The subarachnoid space may become blood-filled in a case of hemorrhage due to a cerebrovascular accident, although according to some neuroanatomists and histologists the subarachnoid space is not involved; instead an intradural space is created. Similar to the dura mater, the arachnoid’s surface is composed of a single layer of flattened fibroblasts that form an epithelioid sheath, from which trabeculae, known as arachnoid trabeculae, extend toward and attach to the external surface of the pia mater."
"These trabeculae are formed from highly attenuated fibroblasts that surround some collagen fibers. The space between the epithelioid sheath and the pia mater, known as the subarachnoid space, is occupied by cerebrospinal fluid and is traversed by numerous arachnoid trabeculae. Blood vessels from the vascular meninges perforate the arachnoid to reach the pia mater; however, each vessel is completely surrounded by arachnoid fibroblasts and, therefore, the vessels never actually enter the subarachnoid space."
"It should be recalled that the blood–brain barrier, established by the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, prevents large molecules from leaving the bloodstream. The arachnoid resembles the dura mater in that it does not follow closely the contours of the brain; therefore, over the sulci, the subarachnoid space is much deeper than over the gyri. Moreover, in certain areas of the brain the arachnoid completely diverges from the pia mater, forming expanded subarachnoid spaces known as subarachnoid cisterns."
"As the CSF percolates through the subarachnoid spaces it also enters the subarachnoid cisterns, filling them. The major subarachnoid cisterns are the cisterna magna , pontine cistern, and interpeduncular and chiasmatic cisterns , as well as the superior cistern . The cisterna magna, the largest of the subarachnoid cisterns, is formed between the caudal aspect of the cerebellum and the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata as the arachnoid stretches across these two structures rather than following the contour of the brain."
"It is the cisterna magna that communicates with the fourth ventricle of the brain via the medial foramen of Magendie, through which the CSF formed by the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain enters the subarachnoid space. The pontine cistern is a much smaller space than the cisterna magna. It is located along the ventral surface of the pons and communicates with the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord caudally, and with the pontine cistern rostrally."
"The basilar artery traverses the pontine cistern. The interpeduncular cistern is located between the right and left cerebral peduncles and receives CSF by way of the two lateral foramina of Luschka, from the fourth ventricle. The interpeduncular cistern is continuous with the chiasmatic cistern and, frequently, the two are considered to be a single cistern, the cisterna basalis, even though the optic chiasma is interjected between them."
"The pontine cistern is traversed by the posterior and middle cerebral arteries as well as by the cerebral arterial circle, whereas the anterior cerebral artery traverses the chiasmatic cistern. The superior cistern  is located in the vicinity of the superior aspect of the cerebellum, the corpora quadrigemina, and the pineal body. As its alternate name implies, the great cerebral vein traverses the superior cistern."
"Arachnoid granulations  are small, but visible with the unaided eye, mushroom-shaped evaginations of the arachnoid protruding into the lumen of the dural sinuses . Most of the arachnoid granulations are associated with lacunae lateralis, diverticula of the superior sagittal sinus, although some jut into the lumen of the sinus. The core of an arachnoid granulation, composed of arachnoid trabeculae, is continuous with the subarachnoid space and is surrounded by the epithelioid layer of the arachnoid and of the dura, forming a membrane that is two cell layers thick."
"As the arachnoid granulation evaginates into the lacuna lateralis it is invested by some cellular and collagenous elements of the meningeal dura mater, which in turn is surrounded by the endothelial lining of the blood vessel. CSF from the subarachnoid space enters into the core of the arachnoid granulation and from there penetrates, probably by osmosis, the epithelioid layers of the arachnoid granulation and the endothelial lining to escape into the lacuna lateralis. Therefore, the function of the arachnoid granulations is transporting CSF manufactured by the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain into the vascular system."
"It is important to note that although the arachnoid granulations protrude into the venous sinuses, they are always separated from the blood by the endothelial lining of the dural sinus/lacuna lateralis. The cranial pia mater is composed of a single layer  of attenuated fibroblasts that form a transparent epithelioid membrane, which closely invests the contours of the brain. The pia mater, unlike the arachnoid or the dura mater, follows the gyri and the sulci, maintaining an uninterrupted contact with the surface of the brain."
"Since the pia mater is vascular it has numerous blood vessels associated with it; however, because this layer is so thin, the vessels are in part surrounded by cells derived from the arachnoid trabeculae and, in part, by cells of the pia mater. Deep to the epithelioid sheath is a thin, discontinuous layer of collagen and elastic fibers. The end-feet of the astrocytes form a protective layer that underlies this subpial extracellular matrix, separating it from the neural tissue."
"In addition to separating the subarachnoid space from the brain tissue, the pia mater also serves to degrade neurotransmitter substances and to prevent material in the subarachnoid space from entering the nervous tissue, as evidenced by the inability of erythrocytes to cross the pia mater in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhages. The dura mater of the spinal cord differs from that of the cranial cavity because it is composed only of the meningeal layer. The periosteal layer is the true periosteum of the vertebral canal and is separated from the meningeal layer by a loose connective tissue and fat-filled epidural space."
"A plexus of veins is embedded in the connective tissue and fat layer. At the level of the second lumbar vertebra the spinal cord ends in the conical-shaped conus medullaris, but the dura mater continues as a cylindrical sheath until it narrows into a cone-shaped structure at the second sacral vertebra. It then continues as a very narrow cylindrical sheath, which becomes anchored into the periosteum of the first and second coccygeal vertebra."
The spinal arachnoid is seamlessly continuous with the cranial arachnoid at the foramen magnum. It closely adheres to the spinal dura mater and there is a potential subdural space between the two layers. The narrow subarachnoid space is filled with CSF that percolates through and around the arachnoid trabeculae.
"At the level of the conus medullaris the subarachnoid space becomes much larger, is referred to as the lumbar cistern, and is filled with the dorsal and ventral rootlets of the spinal nerves, collectively referred to as the cauda equina. These nerve rootlets extend to the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal intervertebral foramina through which they exit to form their respective spinal nerves. As the rootlets of the spinal nerves leave the vertebral canal, they are surrounded by a thin arachnoid sheath to be replaced by the proper connective tissue layers  as they enter the realm of the peripheral nervous system."
"The spinal pia mater very closely invests the spinal cord and at the level of the conus medullaris it is gathered into a very thin, nonnervous filament, the filum terminale, that extends for about 20 cm from the tip of the conus medullaris to become attached to the periosteum of the first coccygeal vertebra. Narrow, triangular, fibrous extensions of the pia mater extend laterally through the arachnoid to attach to the meningeal layer of the dura mater, helping to anchor the spinal cord along its entire length. These triangular extensions of the pia resemble shark’s teeth and, therefore, are known as denticulate ligaments."
"There are 21 pairs of denticulate ligaments, positioned in such a fashion that they are situated about half way between successive spinal nerves. The first pair is located at the level of the foramen magnum and the last pair is situated caudal to the 12th thoracic vertebra. The venous sinuses of the dura mater, formed within reflections of the meningeal dura, are endothelially lined venous channels that are devoid of valves ."
"These sinuses collect blood from the brain and from emissary veins and also receive CSF from the subarachnoid spaces. They empty their contents into the superior jugular bulb of the internal jugular vein as that bulb sits in the jugular foramen. Based on their location and draining patterns the dural venous sinuses are grouped into two major categories, the anterior inferior and posterior superior groups."
"The anterior inferior group of dural sinuses include the cavernous, anterior and posterior intercavernous, sphenoparietal, and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses and the basilar plexus. The two, rather large cavernous sinuses , located on either side of the body of the sphenoid just inferior to the hypophyseal fossa, are connected to each other by the very small anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses, thus forming the circular sinus, encircling the infundibulum of the pituitary gland. The lumen of each cavernous sinus is criss-crossed by a spongy network of endothelially covered filamentous structures that reduce the luminal size and reduce the velocity of blood flow."
"The cavernous sinus receives its blood from a number of sources, including the pterygoid plexus of veins , the angular vein , as well as the middle and inferior cerebral veins. There are numerous interrelationships of the cavernous sinus with the venous channels on the outside of the skull, which presents many possible pathways for the entry of infectious agents with a possibility of meningitis. The superior and inferior petrosal sinuses drain blood from the cavernous sinus into the transverse sinus and into the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein, respectively."
"The cavernous sinus is associated with the internal carotid artery as well as a number of cranial nerves, four of which are embedded in its wall and one other that passes through the lumen of the sinus. Embedded in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus are the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. The internal carotid artery and its associated carotid sympathetic plexus of fibers, as well as the abducent nerve, pass through the lumen of the cavernous sinus."
"It should be stressed, however, that the vessel and nerves travel in a sheath of endothelial cells that isolate them from the bloodstream. The sphenoparietal sinus is a very small sinus that is located on the inferior aspect of the edge of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It receives blood from several tiny meningeal veins and from the anterior temporal diploic vein, and drains into the cavernous sinus."
"The superior petrosal sinus is located in a shallow groove on the superior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It receives blood via small veins from the tympanic cavity, as well as from the cerebellar and inferior cerebral veins and drains into the transverse sinus just prior to its joining the sigmoid sinus. The inferior petrosal sinus, located in the shallow groove formed between the petrous temporal and occipital bones, receives blood from the cavernous and superior petrosal sinuses, the veins of the pons, medulla, and cerebellum, and from the labyrinthine veins."
"The inferior petrosal sinus drains into the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The basilar plexus, a group of slender venous channels located in the meningeal dura mater on the basilar portion of the occipital bone, acts as a venous connection between the right and left inferior petrosal sinuses. It drains into the anterior vertebral plexus of veins."
"The posterior superior group of dural sinuses includes the superior sagittal, inferior sagittal, straight, transverse, sigmoid, petrosquamous, and occipital sinuses as well as the confluence of sinuses . The superior sagittal sinus, located in the superior, convex aspect of the falx cerebri, begins at the foramen cecum, where blood from the emissary vein of the foramen cecum enters it and, usually, ends in the transverse sinus of the right side. Along its length the superior sagittal sinus grooves the internal aspects of the frontal bone, the suture line between the two parietal bones, and the squamous portion of the occipital bone, forming the groove for the superior sagittal sinus."
"This sinus receives blood from many of the cerebral veins, from the superior cerebellar veins, and the emissary veins traversing the parietal foramina. Additionally, lacunae lateralis, endothelially lined spaces housing arachnoid granulations, drain their blood mixed with CSF into the superior sagittal sinus. The inferior sagittal sinus is much smaller, narrower, and shorter than the superior sagittal sinus."
"It is located in the concave, inferior aspect of the falx cerebri occupying a little more than its posterior half. Occasional veins from the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres and small veins of the falx cerebri deliver their blood into the inferior sagittal sinus, which, in turn, drains into the straight sinus. The straight sinus occupies the interface between the tentorium cerebelli and the falx cerebri and is formed by the junction of the great cerebral vein with the inferior sagittal sinus."
"It receives blood from those two structures as well as from some of the cerebellar veins and drains, usually, into the left transverse sinus. The paired transverse sinuses begin at the internal occipital protuberance of the occipital bone and are located in the lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli. They are responsible for the formation of the grooves for the transverse sinuses."
"The right transverse sinus is usually larger and is the continuation of the superior sagittal sinus, whereas the left transverse sinus is the continuation of the straight sinus, although, occasionally the reverse occurs. Each transverse sinus ends in, and delivers its blood to, the sigmoid sinus; whereas each receives blood from the inferior cerebellar vein, the diploic veins from the temporal and occipital regions, the veins from the cerebral hemispheres, and from the petrosquamous and superior petrosal sinuses. Each sigmoid sinus—a continuation of each transverse sinus—follows an S-shaped curve as it grooves the temporal and occipital bones to terminate in the posterior aspect of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein in the jugular foramen."
"The petrosquamous sinus, when present, is located in the meningeal reflection of the dura along the intersection of the petrous and squamous portions of the temporal bone. It receives blood from a diploic vein in its vicinity and drains into the transverse sinus. The smallest of the sinuses is the occipital sinus located in the posterior margin of the falx cerebelli."
"It delivers its blood into the transverse sinus or, with equal frequency, into the confluence of sinuses located just lateral to the internal occipital protuberance. The confluence of sinuses receives blood from the superior sagittal, straight, and occipital sinuses. Blood flow in the confluence of sinuses is somewhat turbulent and pressures are established in such a fashion that, usually, blood arriving from the straight sinus is shunted into the left transverse sinus, whereas blood from the superior sagittal sinus reaches the right transverse sinus."
"Although the choroid plexuses located in every ventricle of the brain manufacture cerebrospinal fluid, the majority of this fluid is formed in the two lateral ventricles. The average rate of CSF production is approximately 14–35 mL per hour for a total daily production of less than 800 mL. However, only about 150 mL of CSF occupies the ventricles, central canal of the spinal cord, perivascular space, and the subarachnoid space and its dilated cisterna at any one time because there is a constant drainage of CSF into the superior sagittal sinus by the numerous arachnoid granulations."
"CSF, a clear fluid with a low density, is rich in sodium, potassium, and chloride ions but has almost no protein and only occasional lymphocytes and a few desquamated epithelioid cells . CSF forms a protective cushion for the brain and spinal cord and is also a recipient of the brain metabolites, which then reach the systemic circulation as the CSF is returned to the bloodstream. The blood–CSF barrier, composed of zonulae occludentes —tight junctions formed by the fusion of cell membranes of contiguous cells of the simple cuboidal epithelium of the choroid plexus—maintains the chemical stability of the CSF."
"These tight junctions prevent paracellular movement of substances, thus requiring them to take the transcellular route via facilitated and active transports across the epithelium of the choroid plexus, resulting in differences in the composition of CSF and plasma. Although the ventricles of the brain have been described previously , they are addressed here for completeness of discussion of the CSF. The four ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord are the remnants of the lumen of the embryonic neural tube."
"The largest ventricles, the paired lateral ventricles, are horseshoe-shaped cavities separated from one another by the septum pellucidum, and are located in the right and left cerebral hemispheres. Each lateral ventricle possesses a body and four horns, the anterior, posterior, lateral, and inferior horns. The anterior horn hollows out the frontal lobe; the inferior lobe is the cavity of the temporal lobe, whereas the occipital lobe houses the variable-sized posterior lobe of the cerebral hemisphere."
The body of each lateral ventricle is located mostly in the parietal lobe. The body and the inferior horn contain a relatively extensive choroid plexus that is responsible for the manufacture of most of the CSF. The two lateral ventricles communicate with the third ventricle via the right and left interventricular foramina  .
"The third ventricle is the quadrilateral, slit-like, vertically positioned space whose walls are formed by the right and left thalami. It is interrupted by a mass of gray matter, the massa intermedia, that forms a bridge between the two thalami. The roof of the third ventricle is formed by the tela choroidea, whereas its floor is formed by the hypothalamus, whose separation from the thalamus is indicated on the wall of the third ventricle by the hypothalamic sulcus."
"The third ventricle has several outpocketings: the preoptic, infundibular, mammillary, and pineal recesses. It is drained by the cerebral aqueduct  that conveys CSF into the fourth ventricle. The fourth ventricle is an irregularly shaped space in the hindbrain, extending from the cerebral aqueduct  posteriorly to the obex anteriorly."
"It is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. The lateral aspect of the fourth ventricle has two openings, the right and left foramina of Luschka and the single, median foramen of Magendie, all three foramina draining the CSF from the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space. Specifically, the foramina of Luschka lead to the interpeducular cistern, whereas the foramen of Magendie delivers the CSF into the cerebellomedullary cistern."
"Meningitis, a bacterial or viral inflammation of the meninges, is an exceptionally dangerous condition affecting about two or three people per 100,000 in the USA annually . The symptoms in neonates and babies include fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, poor feeding, vomiting, irritability, an unusual high-pitched cry when held and quiet when placed down in a stationary position, and occasionally bulging at the fontanelle. In children and adults the symptoms are different and include high fever and chills, severe headache, painful and stiff neck, nausea and/or vomiting, and in later stages, sleepiness, confusion, and difficulty in waking up."
"Meningitis has a high degree of morbidity and mortality, especially if not diagnosed properly. Meningiomas are benign, encapsulated tumors composed of fusiform cells originating in the leptomeninges, specifically the arachnoid. Usually these tumors occur in adults and reach a fairly large size, on average 3 cm, before being diagnosed."
"Approximately 20% of all brain tumors and 10% of all spinal cord tumors are meningiomas, but, depending on their location, most can be treated with relative ease with good prognosis. The symptoms include headaches, seizures, weakness, and possibly paralysis or impairment of some brain functions due to pressure being applied to specific areas of the brain by the tumor. Diagnosis requires either radiographic or MRI techniques."
"The integrity of the blood–brain barrier prevents many substances, including some neurotransmitters and drugs, from penetrating it. In order to permit the delivery of certain drugs through the blood–brain barrier, procedures were developed such as perfusion with a hypertonic solution, mannitol. This temporarily disables the fasciae occludentes of the capillary endothelial cells, allowing the delivery of certain therapeutic drugs."
"The constant production of CSF by the choroid plexus must be mirrored by its constant resorption by the arachnoid villi. If too little CSF is resorbed or if there is a blockage of CSF flow within the ventricular system of the brain, the result will be swelling of the brain tissue, a condition known as hydrocephalus . This situation results in an increased head size in the neonate and fetus, and impaired muscular, cognitive, or other mental functions in the adult, possibly resulting in death if left untreated."
"The immediate concern for any ER physician should be the possibility of meningitis  or possibly even encephalitis . These are two examples of neurologic emergencies, and require careful evaluation. Both of these conditions could result in death, depending on the particular infectious organism involved ."
"Work-up did reveal that this patient had acute meningitis. Because the initial presentation was so suggestive of meningitis, he should have been started immediately on appropriate antibiotics. Any acute infectious illness can be accompanied by dangerously low blood pressure  or other abnormalities of vital signs."
A head CT was performed to look particularly for bleeding or a mass lesion. This was normal . A lumbar puncture was performed to look at the CSF.
"This showed elevated protein , elevated white blood cells , and no red blood cells. The white cells were mostly lymphocytes. Staining for bacteria, fungi, and parasites was negative."
"CSF cultures were negative . After several days, the patient fully recovered. This case represents aseptic meningitis since no organism was identified."
"Most cases of aseptic meningitis are assumed to be viral. This is actually a fairly common infection, and very mild cases are certainly missed since patients may not even go to the doctor for it. Viral meningitis is usually a self-limiting infection and is often mild."
"However, bacterial meningitis is very serious and often results in death or permanent disability. Both viral and bacterial infections are acute, but other organisms cause subacute or chronic meningitis such as tuberculosis or fungi. A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a sudden onset of right arm and leg weakness and altered speech."
The right side of her face is noted by the family to be “droopy” and they say she is speaking “gibberish. ” This began very suddenly about 3 hours before presenting to the ER. The symptoms have been about the same since the onset.
The history cannot be obtained from the patient herself since her speech is not intelligible. The exam shows the patient to be alert and attentive. She can speak words but they are contextually inaccurate and she cannot form understandable sentences or even phrases.
"She cannot speak the names of simple objects that are presented to her, and she cannot follow direction appropriately. The right side of her face and her right arm are very weak, while the right leg is only mildly weak. The rest of the neurologic exam is unremarkable."
"The average brain weighs only about 1,250–1,450 g but receives about 750 mL of blood per minute, almost 20% of the total blood volume, indicating its need for a large supply of oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose. In order to provide the brain with such a high volume of blood, two pairs of major arteries—the right and left vertebral arteries and the right and left internal carotid arteries—deliver all of their blood almost exclusively to the brain. These four vessels form an anastomotic network, the cerebral arterial circle , a very effective system that is designed to ensure an uninterrupted blood supply to the brain."
"The brain’s requirement for a constant blood flow is evidenced by the fact that interruption of the blood supply for 10–15 seconds results in losing consciousness and after 5 minutes without blood flow to the brain irreversible brain damage occurs. With the notable exceptions of the basilar artery and the anterior communicating artery, all other arteries of the brain are paired. Before discussing the blood supply of the brain, it should be noted that although the description that follows implies very specifically established vascular patterns, there are numerous variations even in larger vessels."
"The vertebral arteries serve the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, parts of the thalamus, as well as the cerebellum, whereas the internal carotid artery supplies blood to the remainder of the brain. One tends to think of larger vessels as having thick walls, but those of the brain are thin walled. Furthermore, since the arteries of the brain travel in the subarachnoid space, if there is a hemorrhage the blood accumulates in that space."
"Finally, it should be realized that there is only a limited amount of collateral circulation in the brain, even though the cerebral arterial circle forms anastomotic connections between the right and left sides of the brain. Although the vascular supply of the spinal cord has been covered in Chapter 5, it will be repeated here for two reasons: so that the reader does not have to refer back and so that the reader can appreciate the vascular supply of the entire central nervous system . The anterior spinal arteries, direct branches of the vertebral arteries, join with each other to form a single median vessel, the anterior spinal artery, which occupies and follows the ventral median fissure of the spinal cord ."
"This vessel extends from within the cranial cavity throughout the entire length of the spinal cord and provides small branches that penetrate and supply the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. Moreover, this vessel also supplies the medulla oblongata. The anterior spinal artery may be quite small in the thoracic region."
"The posterior spinal arteries also arise from the vertebral arteries directly, or frequently indirectly, by way of the inferior cerebellar branch of the vertebral artery. Each posterior spinal artery bifurcates to form two longitudinal vessels that extend from within the cranial cavity throughout the entire length of the spinal cord, sandwiching the dorsal rootlets between them. These three vessels provide small branches that penetrate and serve the white and gray matter of the spinal cord as well as the medulla oblongata."
"The 32 pairs of radicular arteries are small vessels that arise from arteries in the immediate vicinity of the spinal column. Each radicular artery enters the intervertebral foramen where it bifurcates, forming an anterior and a posterior radicular artery, which follow the ventral and dorsal roots, respectively, to gain entrance into the vertebral canal. The anterior and posterior radicular arteries anastomose with branches of the anterior and posterior spinal arteries on the surface of the spinal cord, and arborize to supply the white and gray matter of the spinal cord."
"It should be stressed that the radicular arteries are extremely important for the vascularization of the spinal cord, because, with the exception of the cervical region, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries by themselves are unable to provide an adequate vascular supply to the spinal cord. Therefore, an injury to a spinal nerve damages not only the afferent and efferent fibers of a particular spinal cord level, but may also damage the segmental white and gray matter by producing ischemic conditions due to the reduction in blood supply from the radicular artery serving that region. It should be noted that the great ventral radicular artery  is the largest, albeit inconsistent, of the radicular arteries."
"It usually arises on the left-hand side and serves much of the inferior half of the spinal cord, entering the vertebral canal between L2 and L3, and contributes to the formation of the inferior aspect of the ventral spinal artery. Several longitudinally arranged tortuous veins of the pia mater are responsible for the venous drainage of the spinal cord . These are the ventral and dorsal spinal veins that communicate with the segmentally arranged radicular veins."
The radicular veins follow the paths of their companion radicular arteries to leave the vertebral canal via the intervertebral foramina. Along the way they also communicate with the epidural venous network embedded in the epidural fat of the vertebral canal. The epidural venous network delivers its blood into the cavernous sinus of the cranial cavity.
"Cranially, the ventral and dorsal spinal veins drain into the inferior cerebellar veins and inferior petrosal sinuses. he basal lamina-lined endothelial cells of the capillaries of the brain and spinal cord form a blood–brain barrier. These endothelial cells not only form fasciae occludentes with each other, but they have only a limited ability to form caveolae, relying instead mostly on receptormediated transport to transfer material between the capillary lumen and the neural tissue of the CNS."
"Therefore, most macromolecules injected into the capillary lumen are unable to gain access into the intercellular spaces of the brain and spinal cord. Similarly, most macromolecules injected into the intercellular compartment of the CNS are unable to enter the capillary lumen, unless the endothelial cells possess specific receptors for them. Small, noncharged molecules  and numerous small lipid-soluble materials, including some drugs, can dissolve through the lipid membrane of the endothelial cells and thus are able to penetrate the blood–brain barrier."
"Molecules, such as some of the vitamins, amino acids, glucose, and nucleosides, can penetrate the blood–brain barrier via carrier proteins, with or without passive diffusion. Ion channels are also present in the endothelial cell membranes and they are responsible for the transport of ions across the blood–brain barrier. The end-feet of astrocytes contact and form a sheet around the basal lamina of the capillaries of the CNS."
"These end-feet are referred to as the perivascular glia limitans. These astrocytes function not only in maintaining the neurochemical balance of the intercellular compartment of the CNS by removing excess K+ ions and neurotransmitters that were released into the intercellular spaces, but also in transferring metabolites from the capillary lumen to neurons in their vicinity. The internal carotid artery, a terminal branch of the common carotid artery, ascends in the neck, enters the cranial cavity through the carotid canal of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and reaches the cavernous sinus from below."
"It passes through, and subsequently pierces, the roof of the cavernous sinus and enters the cranial cavity where it is flanked by the oculomotor and optic nerves . The internal carotid artery then approximates the anterior perforated substance where it terminates into its various branches. Along this path, from the neck to its termination, the internal carotid artery makes a number of almost 90° turns, thus reducing both the pressure and the velocity of blood it brings to the thin-walled vessels of the brain."
"Although the internal carotid artery is said to be divided into four regions—the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral—only the cavernous and cerebral portions are discussed in this textbook. Readers interested in the  The cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery passes through the substance of the cavernous sinus, but is isolated from the blood of the cavernous sinus by being invested with a simple squamous epithelium. The abducent nerve accompanies the internal carotid artery through the cavernous sinus."
"While in the sinus the artery describes an S-shaped curve and gives off small branches: the cavernous, superior, and inferior hypophyseal, ganglionic, and anterior meningeal arteries. As their names suggest, these vessels serve the areas of their namesake . The cerebral portion of the internal carotid artery is quite short ."
"Almost as soon as it pierces the roof of the cavernous sinus it gives rise to its branches, the ophthalmic, anterior choroidal, and posterior communicating arteries, and its two terminal branches, the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries. The ophthalmic artery is not discussed in this textbook. The anterior choroidal artery is a rather small, narrow artery that arises from the posterior aspect of the internal carotid and follows the path of the optic tract until it reaches the lateral geniculate body, where it enters the choroid fissure to reach and supply the choroid plexus of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle ."
"It gives off numerous branches along the way. These branches serve structures in their vicinity, including the optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radiation, hippocampus, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the tail of the caudate nucleus. The posterior communicating artery connects the cerebral portion of the internal carotid artery to the posterior cerebral branch of the basilar artery ."
"The right and left arteries are not identical, in that one is frequently smaller than the other, and, in fact, one may be entirely absent or doubled. The main function of this vessel is to ensure a viable blood supply to the brain in case the internal carotid or vertebral artery becomes occluded. However, it does also have central branches—thin, unsubstantial vessels—that pierce the region of the cerebrum base that is posterolateral to the infundibulum of the pituitary, and serve part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the medial aspect of the thalamus, and the tissue forming the lateral border of the third ventricle."
"The anterior cerebral artery, one of the two terminal branches of the internal carotid artery, passes between the frontal lobes in the beginning of the longitudinal cerebral fissure, where it lies within a few millimeters of the anterior cerebral artery of the other side . The two vessels follow the genu and then the superior border of the corpus callosum until they each anastomose with the posterior cerebral artery, a branch of the basilar artery. The branches of the anterior cerebral artery are classified into the anterior communicating artery, the central branches, and the cortical branches ."
"The anterior communicating artery is a very short vessel, no more than 5–6 mm in length, that connects the right and left anterior cerebral arteries to each other, forming the anterior end of the cerebral arterial circle . It has two or more small branches, the anteromedial branches, which serve the region of the optic chiasma. A number of small, unnamed vessels arise from the initial part of the anterior cerebral artery, just before the origin of the anterior communicating artery; these supply the septum pellucidum as well as the anterior part of the corpus callosum."
"A larger branch, the medial striate artery , arises just after the origin of the anterior communicating artery. It follows the anterior limb of the internal capsule to supply parts of the following regions of the basal ganglia: the head of the caudate nucleus, part of the putamen, the globus pallidus, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The cortical branches of the anterior cerebral artery arise from that vessel as it courses along the genu and superior aspect of the corpus callosum."
"These branches, named by the areas that they serve, are the orbital, frontal, and parietal arteries. The orbital branches distribute to the inferior aspect of the frontal lobes as they lie on the bony roof of the orbit, and serve the gyrus rectus, medial orbital gyrus, and olfactory lobe. The frontopolar and callosomarginal branches constitute the frontal branches of the anterior cerebral artery."
"The frontopolar artery originates at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum and serves the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus and the region of the lateral surface of the superior and middle frontal gyri. The callosomarginal artery branches from the anterior cerebral artery at the genu of the corpus callosum and parallels its parent artery as far posteriorly as the postcentral gyrus. It supplies blood to the corpus callosum, the cingulate gyrus, the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus, as well as to the precentral and postcentral gyri."
"The remaining portion of the anterior cerebral artery, frequently renamed the pericallosal artery, extends as far posteriorly as the parieto-occipital sulcus, and gives rise to the anterior and posterior parietal arteries. These two vessels and their branches serve the medial aspect of the precuneate gyrus and neighboring structures. The middle cerebral artery, the terminal branch and largest branch of the internal carotid artery, enters the lateral fissure , passes along the free surface of the insula, and gives off several branches that ramify over the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the cerebral cortex ."
"The middle cerebral artery has central and cortical branches, where the former supply blood to the deeper structures and the latter serve the cortical regions . There are 10–15 slender vessels, the striate arteries , that arise from the middle cerebral artery as it gains entry into the lateral fissure. These vessels pierce the floor of the lateral sulcus to supply structures deep within the white matter of the cerebral cortex, including the corpus striatum, much of the head and body of the caudate nucleus, and large portions of the lenticular nucleus and of the external and internal capsules, passing as deep as the external surface of the thalamus."
"The cortical branches originate from the middle cerebral artery as it courses along the lateral sulcus. These vessels, named according to their location and distribution, are the orbital, frontal, parietal, and temporal branches. The orbital branches, the most prominent of which is the orbitofrontal artery, serve the inferior frontal gyrus and the lateral aspect of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe as it lies over the bony roof of the orbit."
"The frontal branches supply the middle frontal and precentral gyri as well as a region of the inferior frontal gyrus. The anterior and posterior parietal branches serve the postcentral gyrus as well as the caudal aspect of the superior and all of the inferior parietal lobules. Two other branches, the parietotemporal and parietooccipital arteries, serve the remainder of the parietal lobe, terminating at the parieto-occipital sulcus, thus supplying the angular and supramarginal gyri."
"The temporal branches consist of three main vessels, the anterior, middle, and posterior temporal arteries. They serve the lateral aspect of the entire temporal lobe as far posteriorly as the occipital gyri. The vertebral artery, the largest branch of the subclavian artery, arises from its first part and ascends in the neck, traveling through the foramina transversaria of the 6th through 1st  vertebrae."
"It describes an S-shaped curve along the posterior arch of the atlas, passes through the foramen magnum and enters the cranial cavity where it joins its counterpart of the other side to form the basilar artery. Only the cranial branches of the vertebral artery are described, and these are the meningeal branches, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, and the medullary branches . The two or three meningeal branches of the vertebral artery serve the falx cerebelli."
"They ramify between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater of the cerebellar fossa. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery arises within the cranial cavity from the vertebral artery about 1–2 cm before the formation of the basilar artery . It passes laterally from the vertebral artery, follows the contour of the medulla oblongata to pass between the rootlets of cranial nerves IX and X and divides into a medial and a lateral branch."
"The medial branch supplies the medial aspect of the cerebellar hemispheres, whereas the lateral branch serves the inferior aspect of the cerebellum and anastomoses with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the superior cerebellar artery. Additional branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery supply the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle as well as the medulla oblongata. Several small branches of the cranial portion of the vertebral artery, known as the medullary branches, serve the medulla oblongata."
"It should be noted that this important region is also served by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery , as well as by the anterior and posterior spinal arteries. The basilar artery, formed by the fusion of the right and left vertebral arteries, lies in a shallow groove in the midline of the pons, extending from the rostral end of the pyramids to the rostral end of the pons . It has several small branches, the pontine and labyrinthine arteries, and three larger branches, the anterior inferior cerebellar, superior cerebellar, and posterior cerebral arteries ."
"The several small pontine arteries arise at right angles to the basilar artery and serve the pons and the midbrain, penetrating deep into the substance of these two regions. The labyrinthine  artery is larger than the pontine arteries and originates somewhat rostral to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery . It reaches and enters the internal auditory meatus in the company of cranial nerves VII and VIII, and supplies the internal ear."
"The anterior inferior cerebellar artery arises from the basilar artery just rostral to the pyramids and follows cranial nerve VI for a short distance. It loops around cranial nerves VII and VIII, just before they enter the internal acoustic meatus. Shortly before reaching the cerebellopontine angle, the artery gives rise to small pontine branches that pierce the lateral aspect of the pons."
"At the cerebellopontine angle the anterior inferior cerebellar artery bifurcates into medial and lateral branches that serve the anteromedial and anterolateral aspects of the cerebellum, respectively. The branches of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery anastomose with branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and with those of the superior cerebellar artery. The superior cerebellar artery originates just caudal to the third cranial nerve."
"It curves around the cerebral peduncle to gain the superior surface of the cerebellum, which it vascularizes, and as it arborizes its branches provide vascular supply to the pineal body, the midbrain, and the choroid plexus of the third ventricle. Branches of the superior cerebellar artery anastomose with branches of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The right and left posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar artery ."
"Each originates just rostral to the superior cerebellar artery and follows the course of that vessel as they both curve around the cerebral peduncle. It should be noted that the third cranial nerve is located between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries. The posterior cerebral artery is connected to the internal carotid artery by the posterior communicating artery, forming the posterior limb of the cerebral arterial circle."
"Branches of the posterior cerebral artery are the cortical, central, and posterior choroidal arteries. The cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery vascularize the medial aspect of the temporal and occipital lobes. They are usually four in number: the anterior and posterior temporal, parieto-occipital, and occipital  branches."
"The anterior temporal branch serves the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus; the posterior temporal branch vascularizes the lateral and medial occipitotemporal gyri; the parietooccipital branch serves the cuneate and precuneate gyri; and the occipital  branch follows the calcarine sulcus to serve the lingual and cuneate gyri of the primary visual cortex. The central branches of the posterior cerebral artery are classified into two divisions: the thalamic and mesencephalic  branches. The thalamic branches, supplying regions of the thalamus and hypothalamus, are divided into the anterior and posterior thalamic branches, where the anterior thalamic branches serve the optic tract, the mammillary bodies, and the anterior and ventromedial nuclei of the thalamus."
"The posterior thalamic branches vascularize the posterior thalamic nuclei and the geniculate bodies. The mesencephalic and circumflex mesencephalic branches serve the cerebral peduncles, the interpeduncular region, the corticospinal tracts, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the substantia nigra, and the tegmentum of the midbrain. There are at least two posterior choroidal arteries—the lateral choroidal and medial choroidal arteries."
"The lateral choroidal branches serve the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle as well as the lateral geniculate body, the pulvinar, and the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. The medial choroidal branches serve the choroid plexus of the third ventricle as well as the pineal body, the superior and inferior colliculi, the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus, and in many cases even vascularize the pulvinar, where they anastomose with the lateral choroidal branches. As described above, the cerebral arterial circle connects the branches of the two internal carotid arteries to the branches of the two vertebral arteries, forming a method of shunting blood from one side to the other in case of a blockage in any one of the vessels ."
"The anterior communicating artery forms the anterior connection and the posterior communicating artery forms the posterior connection between the right and left sides. The arteries involved in the circle are: the right internal carotid, right anterior cerebral, anterior communicating, left anterior cerebral, left internal carotid, left posterior communicating, left posterior cerebral, right posterior cerebral, right posterior communicating, and back to the right internal carotid. The major vessels arising from the anterior, lateral, and posterior aspects of the cerebral arterial circle supply the cerebrum ."
"The arterial circle lies inferior to the hypothalamus and encompasses the mammillary bodies, infundibulum, optic chiasma, and tuber cinereum, among other structures. Blood from these thin-walled veins reaches the dural venous sinuses via vessels that penetrate both the arachnoid and the meningeal layer of the dura mater. The dural venous sinuses are discussed in Chapter 7."
"The cerebral veins are subdivided into two categories: the external veins, which drain the superficial aspect of the cerebrum, and the internal veins, which drain the deep regions of the cerebrum . There are three external veins, the superior, superficial middle, and inferior cerebral veins. The 15 or so superior cerebral veins are lodged mostly in the sulci, though they occasionally pass along the surface of the gyri."
"These vessels drain blood from the medial and superolateral aspects of the cerebrum and empty into the superior sagittal sinus. The superficial middle cerebral vein is located within the lateral fissure  and drains blood from the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemisphere. It delivers its blood into the superior sagittal sinus by way of the superior anastomotic vein, into the transverse sinus, via the inferior anastomotic vein, and continues posteriorly until it reaches, and empties into, the cavernous sinus."
"The small inferior cerebral veins drain blood from the inferior aspect of the cerebrum and deliver it into the superior sagittal sinus by way of the superior cerebral veins. The inferior cerebral veins that drain blood from the inferior aspect of the temporal lobe deliver their blood into the cavernous, transverse, sphenoparietal, and superior petrosal sinuses, via the basal and middle cerebral veins. The internal veins drain structures deeper within the brain and are composed of the great cerebral vein and their tributaries as well as the basal vein."
"The great cerebral vein, a short vessel formed by the union of the right and left internal cerebral veins, drains into the straight sinus in common with the inferior sagittal sinus. The great cerebral vein receives blood from its tributaries that drain the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and midbrain. The thalamostriate vein receives tributaries that drain the region of the thalamus and corpus striatum, whereas the choroid vein follows the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle and receives tributaries from the fornix, hippocampus, and corpus callosum."
"At the level of the interventricular foramen  the choroid vein joins the thalamostriate vein to form the internal cerebral vein, which, shortly after receiving the basal vein, joins its counterpart from the other side to form the great cerebral vein. The basal vein, formed by its three tributaries at the anterior perforated substance, the anterior cerebral vein, the deep middle cerebral vein, and the inferior striate veins, receives blood from the parahippocampal gyrus, interpeduncular fossa, midbrain, and lateral ventricle. The superior cerebellar veins drain the superior region of the cerebellum and empty into the straight sinus, the great cerebral vein, and the transverse and superior petrosal sinuses."
"The inferior cerebellar veins drain the inferior aspect of the cerebellum and empty into the occipital, superior petrosal, and transverse sinuses. The veins of the brainstem drain the medulla, pons, and midbrain by forming a superficial plexus of veins. These vessels deliver their blood to the vertebral veins, the veins of the spinal cord, and the basilar and inferior petrosal sinuses, as well as into the basal and great cerebral veins."
Aneurysms are local dilation or ballooning of a vessel due to the weakening of its wall. The most common location for an aneurysm in the brain is the posterior communicating artery as it originates from the internal carotid artery. The largest of the slender striate arteries  is frequently known as the artery of cerebral hemorrhage because its aneurysm is the most likely source of strokes in hypertensive patients.
"This vessel, a branch of the middle cerebral artery, passes between the external capsule and the lentiform nucleus and penetrates as deep as the caudate nucleus. The brain receives approximately 750 mL of blood per minute from the right and left internal carotid arteries and from the basilar artery, where each of the three vessels supplies about the same volume of blood flow. This volume translates to about 55 mL of cerebral blood flow per minute per 100 g of brain tissue."
"Ischemia occurs if this blood flow is less than 35 mL/min/100 g of brain tissue, whereas a blood flow of below 15 mL/min/100 g of brain tissue for 5 minutes or longer is considered to be an infarct resulting in the death of brain tissue. The infarct may also be due to complete cessation of blood flow because of hemorrhage, thrombosis, embolism, or vasospasm. Due to the specificity of the blood–brain barrier, certain drugs, antibiotics, and neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, are unable to penetrate the barrier."
"In order to facilitate the entry of therapeutic substances, a hypertonic solution of mannitol is administered which temporarily disables the fasciae occludentes of the capillary endothelial cells. Additionally, it is possible to couple antibodies that have been developed against capillary endothelial cell transferrin receptors, to the drugs that need to be administered. The antibody permits the transport of the drug–antibody complex across the blood–brain barrier and into the CNS."
"A stroke  is a very serious event that results in irreversible damage to a region of the brain whose blood supply has been compromised to such an extent that the involved region can no longer be perfused adequately. The neurons of the region do not receive enough oxygen to sustain them and they die. The severity of the stroke is a function of the region involved and the extent of the damage, therefore the effect may range from minimal damage to death."
"In the USA, stroke is the third most common cause of death, preceded only by heart disease and cancer. Stroke has numerous risk factors, some of which, such as cigarette smoking and hypertension, can be controlled with relative ease, whereas other factors, such as family history and heart disease, cannot be controlled. There are two types of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke."
"Approximately 85% of all stroke cases are due to ischemic stroke, which is the result of embolism of one of the cerebral arteries, vascular disease, or anomalies of the coagulation process. It has been shown that 15–20% of the patients with ischemic stroke die within 30 days of the event. Hemorrhagic stroke, which involves bleeding either into the meninges or the brain tissue, has a much higher mortality rate, with 40–80% of patients dying within 30 days."
"The lateral medullary syndrome, also known as the posterior inferior cerebellar artery  syndrome, involves occlusion of the branches of the vertebral artery or, less commonly, of the PICA. It is the most commonly occurring brainstem stroke and it has a very good recovery rate. The symptoms of the lateral medullary syndrome include miosis, ptosis, vertigo, dysarthria, and ipsilateral hemiataxia."
"Basilar artery thrombosis is a very serious stroke that involves loss of vascular supply to much of the brainstem, resulting in quadriplegia and frequently in death due to respiratory failure. This patient has had a stroke. It is in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery  on the left."
"The MCA is a common target for stroke; it is sometimes in the full distribution of the MCA, but more commonly only part of it is affected. Some symptoms that are characteristic of MCA territory strokes include hemiparesis and/or hemisensory loss , aphasia , and sometimes hemineglect . This patient exhibits aphasia and hemiparesis."
Some information cannot be ascertained in aphasic patients since they cannot talk about their symptoms. The two common etiologies of strokes are embolism and cerebral thrombosis. Emboli commonly arise from a cardiac source.
"A thrombus forms within the heart and a piece or pieces break off, travel downstream, and become lodged within one or more cerebral arteries. A thrombus can also form within a cerebral artery, or one of the arteries leading to the brain . The blockage can lead to a reduction of blood flow that, if severe enough and prolonged, leads to infarction."
"This patient had an urgent head CT . Other testing would include carotid ultrasound or cerebral magnetic resonance angiography  to look at the appropriate arterial circulation, and echocardiogram. Cardiac thrombus is often prompted by atrial fibrillation, so it would be important to monitor the cardiac rhythm."
"Treatment for stroke includes intravenous tissue plasminogen activator if it can be started within 3 hours of the stroke onset, intraarterial thrombolysis if given within 6 hours of onset, carotid endarterectomy if there is severe carotid stenosis from the thrombus , aspirin or similar medications, or heparin. A 55-year-old man presents with generalized weakness and fatigue. This had been ongoing for the past year."
"He also notes a dry mouth and dry, irritated eyes. He admits to impotence. There is some mild constipation."
He has been a heavy smoker since he was 15 years old. On examination there is mild to moderate weakness noted in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs. He has difficulty rising from a chair without the help of his arms.
There is no sensory abnormality and his reflexes are normal. His blood pressure when supine is 150/90 and his heart rate is 80. When standing the blood pressure is 118/76 and the heart rate is 78.
"The cells constituting the autonomic nervous system, located in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, innervate smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and glands. They perform their functions below the conscious levels. Functionally, there are three components to the autonomic nervous system, namely sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric."
"Although it is usually treated as a motor system—the general visceral efferent  system—the autonomic nervous system does possess afferent components. As a generalization it may be stated that the sympathetic nervous system functions in “fight or flight,” the parasympathetic nervous system functions in “digest and rest,” whereas the enteric nervous system functions in “overseeing the digestive process. ” It is important to note from the outset that there are major differences in the neuronal arrangement of the somatic motor nervous system and the motor limb of the autonomic nervous system ."
"In the somatic nervous system the cell body of the lower motoneuron is located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The axon of that neuron leaves the spinal cord via the ventral rootlets and passes directly to the muscle fibers it is destined to innervate. Thus, only a single neuron is required to relay the signal for muscle contraction."
"In the autonomic nervous system two neurons are required to effect a contraction of smooth muscle or cardiac muscle, or to elicit secretion from the cell of a gland. The nerve cell body of the first neuron is in the central nervous system , whereas the nerve cell body of the second neuron is in a ganglion in the peripheral nervous system. Because the second nerve cell body resides in an autonomic ganglion, that nerve cell is referred to as the postganglionic neuron , whereas the first neuron in this two neuron chain, is known as the preganglionic neuron ."
"The axon of the preganglionic neuron, the preganglionic fiber, is myelinated and it synapses with the postganglionic neuron’s soma. The axon of the postganglionic neuron, the postganglionic fiber, is not myelinated. It should be realized that somatic sensory ganglia do not have synapses, whereas synapses do occur in autonomic ganglia."
"As a generalization, it may be stated that the length of preganglionic and postganglionic fibers differ in that in the sympathetic nervous system the preganglionic fibers are short and the postganglionic fibers are long. In the parasympathetic nervous system the opposite is usually true, in that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are long and the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers are usually short. The neurotransmitter substance at the parasympathetic preganglionic and postganglionic and sympathetic preganglionic synapse is acetylcholine, whereas at the sympathetic postganglionic synapse it is norepinephrine ."
"The only exception to this rule is that the postganglionic sympathetic fibers serving the eccrine sweat glands release acetylcholine. In addition to the primary neurotransmitter, co-transmitters are also usually released. The fibers of the sensory  limb of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems travel with blood vessels, cranial nerves, and visceral motor fibers."
"They frequently pass through but do not synapse in the autonomic ganglia. Instead their cell bodies  are located in the sensory ganglia of the cranial and spinal nerves. The soma of the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system are located in the lateral cell column of spinal cord levels T1 to L2,3 ."
"Since the axons of these neurons exit the vertebral canal in the ventral root of the spinal nerve at the levels of their origin, the sympathetic nervous system is also known as the thoracolumbar outflow. The cell bodies of the postganglionic sympathetic neurons reside in the sympathetic chain ganglia , the pelvic ganglia, the preaortic ganglia, and the small renal ganglia . Some of the functions of the sympathetic nervous system are given in Table ."
"Preganglionic fibers  enter the spinal nerve via  the ventral rootlets; they subsequently leave the spinal nerve via 14 pairs of small branches, known as white rami communicantes  to reach one of the sympathetic chain ganglia. Once preganglionic sympathetic fibers have entered the chain ganglion they have one of three options : 1 To form synapses with postganglionic, sympathetic soma in the chain ganglion at the level of entry. 2 To proceed superiorly or inferiorly in the sympathetic chain and synapse in a ganglion above or below the point of entry."
"This may be as far superiorly as the cervical level or as far inferiorly as the sacral level. 3 To pass through the chain ganglion without synapsing in any of the paravertebral ganglia, joining with other preganglionic fibers to form the greater, lesser, or least splanchnic nerves to synapse in one of the prevertebral sympathetic chain ganglia, specifically the pelvic, renal, or preaortic ganglia. The paravertebral ganglia in the neck fuse to form three ganglia, the largest of which is the superior cervical ganglion, the smaller middle cervical ganglion, and the smallest inferior cervical ganglion."
"Quite often the inferior cervical ganglion fuses with the first thoracic sympathetic chain ganglion to form the enlarged stellate ganglion. The caudal-most ganglia of the right and left paravertebral chains fuse with each other in the coccygeal region, thus forming the unpaired ganglion impar. The postganglionic fibers  arise from the sympathetic chain ganglia and are distributed as branches to the spinal nerves or cranial nerves, or they may travel wrapped around arteries, or they may proceed directly to specific organs or to autonomic plexuses ."
"1 Branches to spinal nerves re-enter the spinal nerve through connections known as gray rami communicantes . Unlike white rami communicantes, there re 31 pairs of gray rami communicantes, one for each spinal nerve. The postganglionic sympathetic fibers are distributed with the cutaneous branches of the spinal nerves, reaching the sweat glands, arrector pili muscles, and smooth muscles of peripheral blood vessels."
"2 Branches to cranial nerves may reach the cranial nerves directly, namely, the glossopharyngeal , vagus , and hypoglossal  nerves or they may follow blood vessels until they are in the vicinity of the cranial nerve that they use to reach their final destination. 3 Branches wrapped around arteries travel with these vessels, such as the internal and external carotid arteries and the vertebral artery. There are numerous other arteries that possess postganglionic sympathetic fibers in their tunicae adventitia and they are discussed below."
"4 Branches proceeding directly to specific organs may travel on arteries, in nerves, or through plexuses, but they travel on their own, at least for a while. These include postganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the eyes and the heart. 5 Branches that proceed to autonomic plexuses possess either postganglionic or preganglionic fibers, depending on the plexus."
"Those that serve the heart, lungs, and pelvis are probably postganglionic, whereas those that are destined for the abdominal plexuses are preganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the postganglionic soma in the walls of the organ to be innervated. The greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves are the major nerve fibers that contain preganglionic sympathetic axons destined for the abdominal plexuses. The sympathetic nervous system may be subdivided into two categories:  those associated with the chain ganglia; and  a collection of autonomic plexuses whose postganglionic fibers are distributed to the abdominal and pelvic viscera."
"The chain ganglia, although a single entity, may be viewed as being composed of five discrete regions that correspond to the head, neck, thorax, abdominolumbar region, and pelvis. The cephalic region of the sympathetic nervous system has no ganglia of its own, instead it is composed only of postganglionic sympathetic fibers whose cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglia. These fibers are primarily associated with the tunica adventitia of blood vessels passing from the neck into the head, are named according to their vessel of association or by their location, or by the localized region that they serve."
"The internal carotid nerves travel with the internal carotid arteries as two separate plexuses, the internal carotid plexus and the cavernous plexus. The internal carotid plexus travels on the lateral aspect of the artery and has the following branches: • Branches communicating with cranial nerve V  and cranial nerve VI . • The deep petrosal nerve: this pierces the cartilage of the foramen lacerum and accompanies the greater petrosal nerve as the two nerves enter the pterygoid canal to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal ."
"This nerve proceeds to the pterygopalatine ganglion in the same named fossa. Some branches derived from the greater petrosal nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, but none of the branches derived from the deep petrosal nerve synapse , instead they become distributed by branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve to the glands and blood vessels of the pharynx, palate, and nasal cavity. • The caroticotympanic nerves: these are small fibers that are destined to serve regions of the middle ear."
The cavernous plexus travels on the medial aspect of the artery and has the following branches: • Branches communicating with cranial nerve IV  and cranial nerve V1 . • Branches destined for the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris. These travel with the long ciliary nerve as well as with the short ciliary nerves  to pierce the orb and synapse on the muscle fibers.
"• Branches serving the vessels of the pituitary gland, brain, meninges, and orbit. The external carotid nerves, composed of postganglionic sympathetic fibers derived from the superior cervical ganglion, travel with the external carotid artery and its branches in the head. These include the following: • Nerve fibers that follow the facial artery: these travel to and serve the submandibular gland and, using the lingual nerve, reach and serve the sublingual gland."
"• Nerve fibers that travel on branches of the facial and superficial temporal arteries, serving them as well as arrector pili muscles and sweat glands of the facial region. • The small deep petrosal nerve: this leaves the middle meningeal artery to pass through  the otic ganglion. It joins the auriculotemporal nerve and serves the parotid gland."
"The cervical region of the sympathetic trunk is composed of the superior, middle, and inferior sympathetic cervical ganglia as well as the sympathetic cord that connects them to each other. None of these receive white rami communicantes because the preganglionic fibers enter the chain ganglia at thoracic levels T1–T5, and proceed superiorly in the cord to reach and synapse on postganglionic soma residing in one of the three ganglia. Postganglionic fibers leave the ganglia gathered in nerves of various caliber that join the arteries, cervical spinal nerves, and cranial nerves."
"Branches are derived from each cervical ganglion and are detailed below. The superior cervical ganglion, the largest of the three ganglia, is located deep to the carotid sheath, at the level of the atlas. It has numerous branches, some of which  were detailed in the section above ."
"The additional branches are those that travel with the cranial nerves and cervical spinal nerves, the pharyngeal branches, the intercarotid plexus, and the superior cardiac nerves: • Branches traveling with cranial nerves IX, X, and XII. • Branches traveling with the first four cervical nerves. • The four to six pharyngeal branches that form the pharyngeal plexus in unison with cranial nerves IX and X."
• The intercarotid plexus that proceeds to the carotid sinus and carotid body to innervate the smooth muscle of the regional blood vessels. • The superior cardiac nerves of the right and left side: these join the cardiac plexus and innervate the cardiac muscle of the heart. They function in concert with the middle and inferior cardiac nerves to accelerate the rate of heart beat.
"The smallest of the ganglia, the middle cervical ganglion, has an inconstant location and is occasionally absent. The branches arising from the middle cervical ganglion are those that join the cervical spinal nerves, the middle cervical nerve, and the thyroid nerves: • Gray rami communicantes to the fifth and sixth cervical nerves that are distributed with the branches of these cervical nerves. • The middle cardiac nerve, also known as the great cardiac nerve: this communicates with the superior cardiac nerve to join the cardiac plexus."
"It functions, in concert with the superior and inferior cardiac nerves, to accelerate the rate of the heart beat. • The thyroid nerves: these travel on the tunica adventitia of the inferior thyroid artery to reach and supply the thyroid gland. • The region of the sympathetic cord connecting the middle and inferior cervical ganglia."
"This is usually split into an anterior and a posterior portion; the anterior portion passes around the subclavian artery, forming a loop—the ansa subclavia. The inferior cervical ganglion is located at the level of the transverse process of the 7th cervical vertebra. The branches arising from the inferior cervical ganglion are the ones that join the cervical spinal nerves, the inferior cardiac nerves, and the vertebral nerve: • Gray rami communicantes to cervical spinal nerves 6–8: these are distributed with the branches of these cervical nerves."
"• Inferior cardiac nerves: these join the cardiac plexus and function, in concert with the superior and middle cardiac nerves, to accelerate the rate of heart beat. • Vertebral nerve: this travels on the tunica adventitia of the vertebral artery and serves it as well as its intracranial branches with vasomotor function. The inferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia frequently fuse to form the stellate ganglion."
"This fused ganglion fulfills all the functions of the inferior cervical ganglion and also gives rise to the gray rami communicantes of spinal nerves T1 and T2. Theoretically, there are 12 thoracic sympathetic ganglia connected to each other by short segments of the sympathetic cord, but fusion of occasional ganglia with each other reduces their number to approximately 10. White rami communicantes are connections between the thoracic spinal nerves and the thoracic chain ganglia."
"They carry preganglionic sympathetic fibers from the lateral column of the spinal cord, which enter each thoracic sympathetic ganglion to synapse with postganglionic sympathetic soma residing in a sympathetic ganglion at any level of the chain ganglia or in a sympathetic ganglion located elsewhere in the body. Branches arising from the thoracic sympathetic ganglia are the gray rami communicantes, the visceral branches, and the splanchnic nerves. The gray rami communicantes arise from each thoracic ganglion to unite with their associated thoracic spinal nerve, carrying postganglionic sympathetic fibers that will be distributed with the branches of the spinal nerve."
"The visceral branches are composed of postganglionic sympathetic fibers that are distributed to plexuses on or in the vicinity of the heart, esophagus, lungs, and aorta: • Cardiac branches arise from the first through fifth thoracic ganglia and are destined for the cardiac plexus. They mix with fibers from the superior, middle, and inferior cardiac nerves. They also function in accelerating the rate of the heart beat."
• Esophageal branches arise from many of the thoracic ganglia and serve to modify the function of the enteric nervous system. • Fibers destined for the pulmonary plexus arise from the second through fourth thoracic ganglia and enter the hilum of the lung. They serve the blood vessels of the lung as well as the bronchial musculature.
"• The aortic plexus is served by fibers arising from the fifth to tenth  thoracic ganglia. These fibers distribute with the branches of the aorta and probably function to modulate the enteric nervous system. The splanchnic nerves are composed of mostly myelinated preganglionic sympathetic fibers , because they have not synapsed in the chain ganglia; instead they passed through the ganglia on their way to the preaortic ganglia."
"There are three splanchnic nerves: the greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves. 1 The greater splanchnic nerves, formed into a single trunk from preganglionic sympathetic fibers that pass through the fifth to ninth thoracic ganglia, penetrate the crus of the diaphragm to synapse in the celiac ganglion . Some fibers continue through the celiac ganglion without synapsing, and continue to the suprarenal gland medulla and synapse there on chromaffin cells."
"It is interesting to note that the chromaffin cells of the suprarenal medulla, as well as the neurons of sympathetic ganglia, are derived from neural crest cells. Thus chromaffin cells act as modified postganglionic sympathetic neurons and release their secretory product, epinephrine and norepinephrine, into the capillary beds of the suprarenal medulla. Approximately 85% of the chromaffin cells release epinephrine and 15% release norepinephrine."
"2 The lesser splanchnic nerve, formed into a single trunk from preganglionic sympathetic fibers that pass through the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia, penetrates the crus of the diaphragm and synapses in the aorticorenal ganglion. 3 The least splanchnic nerve, formed from preganglionic sympathetic fibers that pass through the twelfth thoracic ganglion, passes through the diaphragm and synapses in the renal plexus. The abdominolumbar sympathetic trunk is highly variable in that there are two to six ganglia, with an average of four ganglia, connected to one another by cords of varying lengths."
"The right and left sympathetic trunks in the abdominal cavity are almost hidden by the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta, respectively. Branches of the abdominolumbar trunk are composed of gray rami communicantes, lumbar splanchnic nerves, and branches of the celiac ganglion: • Gray rami communicantes in the lumbar area are somewhat longer than those of the thoracic region. They join the spinal nerves to be distributed with them to innervate the smooth muscle of blood vessels as well as the glands and arrector pili of the skin."
"• Lumbar splanchninc nerves, preganglionic sympathetic fibers that are located caudal to the least splanchnic nerve, synapse in the inferior mesenteric ganglion. • Branches of the celiac ganglion are postganglionic sympathetic fibers that follow the aorta and its branches and form a large plexus of nerve fibers, the celiac plexus. The preganglionic cell bodies of the parasympathetic nervous system are located in cranial nerves as well as in the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord."
"Therefore, the parasympathetic nervous system is also referred to as the craniosacral outflow. Some of the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system are given in Table . The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers of the cranial portion of the parasympathetic nervous system travel with four cranial nerves, the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves ."
"The Edinger–Westphal nucleus houses preganglionic parasympathetic soma whose axons travel in the branches of cranial nerve III. When these preganglionic fibers reach the orbit they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic soma in the ciliary ganglion . The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers, known as the short ciliary nerves, exit the ciliary ganglion, pierce the orb  to innervate the sphincter pupillae muscle, which constricts the pupils."
"They also innervate the muscles of the ciliary body, which function in accommodating the lens of the eye when focusing on nearby objects. The lacrimal and superior salivatory nuclei of the brainstem house the preganglionic parasympathetic soma associated with cranial nerve VII. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the lacrimal nucleus reach the pterygopalatine ganglion  where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic soma."
"Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the ganglion and serve the lacrimal gland, eliciting the production of tears, as well as glands in the nasal mucosa, eliciting the production of mucus. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the superior salivatory nucleus proceed to the submandibular ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic soma. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the ganglion to innervate the submandibular and sublingual glands, eliciting the flow of saliva."
"The inferior salivatory nucleus  of the brainstem houses the preganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies associated with cranial nerve IX. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from this nucleus reach the otic ganglion to synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic soma. Their postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the ganglion to innervate the parotid gland as well as minor salivary glands in the oral mucosa, eliciting the flow of saliva."
The nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve house the preganglionic parasympathetic soma associated with cranial nerve X. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers from the nucleus ambiguus synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic soma located in the cardiac ganglia distributed around the great vessels of the heart. Postganglionic parasympathetic axons leave the ganglia and innervate the sinoatrial  node.
Additionally these fibers also serve occasional atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle fibers. The parasympathetic nervous system decreases the rate of the heart beat. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus synapse with the following soma: • Postganglionic parasympathetic soma located in ganglia surrounding the bronchial passages.
Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers derived from these ganglia serve to elicit bronchioconstriction. • Postganglionic parasympathetic soma located in the vicinity of the pancreas. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers derived from these ganglia serve to elicit the release of pancreatic enzymes and buffer.
"• Postganglionic parasympathetic soma along the gastrointestinal tract extending from the esophagus to the end of the transverse colon. These postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies are housed in Meissner’s submucosal and Auerbach’s myenteric plexus  located within the wall of the alimentary canal. Moreover, many of the preganglionic parasympathetic axons synapse with the intrinsic soma of the enteric nervous system."
"Parasympathetic activity facilitates the digestive process and relaxes sphincter muscles. The lateral cell column of the second to fourth segments of the sacral spinal cord houses the preganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies composing the sacral division of the parasympathetic nervous system. Their preganglionic axons join their corresponding spinal nerves and travel to the pelvic plexus and to scattered small ganglia in the vicinity of the pelvic organs, where they synapse with the enteric nervous system and with postganglionic cell bodies of the parasympathetic ganglia."
"Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic plexus and the additional small ganglia serve the urinary bladder, penis, prostate, and seminal vesicles in the male as well as the bladder, uterus, clitoris, and vagina in the female. The bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles receive their motor innervation from the small ganglia in their vicinity, except for the sphincter muscle controlling the bladder, which is inhibited by the parasympathetic nervous system. The uterus and vagina receive inhibitory postganglionic parasympathetic fibers via the uterovaginal plexus."
Although in the pregnant female the same fibers are believed to have excitatory roles. The external genitalia of the male and the clitoris of the female receive postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic plexus via the pudendal nerve; these fibers are responsible for dilation of the cavernous blood sinuses resulting in the erection of the penis and clitoris. Meissner’s submucosal plexus and Auerbach’s myenteric plexus house the intrinsic components of the enteric nervous system.
"The neurons and neuroglial cells of the enteric nervous system originate from neural crest cells. Meissner’s submucosal plexus is located in the submucosa at its interface with the inner circular layer of the muscularis externa. Generally speaking, Meissner’s submucosal plexus is responsible for peristalsis and global, rather than local, actions."
"Auerbach’s myenteric plexus is located between the inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa. Generally speaking, Auerbach’s plexus is responsible for localized phenomena and for movement of, and glandular secretions from, the mucosa. The two sets of plexuses interact with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as well as with each other and function together to ensure that the alimentary canal performs its functions properly."
The extrinsic components of the enteric nervous system are the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that modulate the functioning of the intrinsic components. The extrinsic components are necessary but not essential for normal functioning of the digestive tract. Parasympathetic innervation facilitates digestion by increasing peristalsis and relaxing sphincters.
"Vigorous activity from the sympathetic innervation slows down peristalsis and increases sphincter muscle tonus. The intrinsic components of the enteric nervous system regulate much of the digestive processes by innervating the smooth muscles, glands, as well as the diffuse neuroendocrine system  cells residing in the epithelial lining of the alimentary canal. There are at least 20 different types of DNES cells and each releases a specific paracrine hormone ."
"These hormones act in concert to regulate much of the digestive process. A select list of these cells, their hormones, and their function is presented in Table . Because the two primary neurotransmitters are acetylcholine and norepinephrine, it is customary to speak of cholinergic and adrenergic divisions of the autonomic nervous system."
"Preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons, preganglionic sympathetic neurons, and those postglanglionic sympathetic neurons that innervate eccrine sweat glands are all cholinergic. All other postganglionic sympathetic neurons are adrenergic. Autonomic receptors are classified as cholinergic or adrenergic , based on their ability to bind and to be activated by acetylcholine or norepinephrine, respectively."
"Subtypes of both cholinergic and adrenergic receptors have been identified. Additionally, other types of receptors are also present. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are the two types of cholinergic receptors There are two types of cholinergic receptors, namely, muscarinic receptors and nicotinic receptors."
"The former are also activated by muscarine, a toxin derived from toadstools, and the latter are also activated by nicotine. It is important to note that nicotine will not activate muscarinic receptors and muscarine will not activate nicotinic receptors, but both types will be activated by acetylcholine. Muscarinic receptors are located in the membranes of cells synapsing with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers and in the membranes of eccrine sweat glands ."
"Nicotinic receptors are located in the membranes of postganglionic sympathetic and postganglionic parasympathetic soma where they synapse with their preganglionic counterparts. They are also located in the sarcolemma of the myoneural junctions of skeletal muscle cells. There are two types of adrenergic receptors, alpha adrenergic receptors and beta adrenergic receptors, each with its own subtypes."
"Alpha adrenergic receptors are more easily activated by epinephrine than by norepinephrine and are least activated by isoproterenol. Alpha receptors are located in the plasma membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells, dilatator pupillae muscle cells, and soma of enteric neurons controlling sphincter muscle contraction. Beta adrenergic receptors are more responsive to isoproterenol than to epinephrine and are least activated by norepinephrine."
"Beta receptors are located in the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells, bronchiolar smooth muscle cells, and soma of enteric neurons that facilitate peristaltic activity of the alimentary canal. There are additional receptors, especially in the enteric nervous system, that are neither cholinergic nor adrenergic. These respond to various other neurotransmitter substances, such as somatostatin, substance P, adenosine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, etc."
", many of which are detailed in Chapter 4. The somatic and autonomic nervous systems interact with each other to perform numerous functions, among them those that control urination, defecation, and erection and ejaculation. The process of retaining urine in, and evacuating urine from, the urinary bladder is a learned function that requires the interactions of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic motor nervous systems and is controlled by the cerebral cortex and pons."
"As the urinary bladder distends, nociceptors and stretch receptors in its wall transmit the information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These afferent nerves are unipolar  neurons whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia. If the volume of urine in the bladder is low, the skeletal muscles of the external sphincter undergo reflex contraction in response to stimulation by axons of somatic motoneurons whose cell bodies are located in the Onuf nucleus ."
"Cell bodies of the motor neurons in the Onuf nucleus are activated by projections from the pons and cerebral cortex . Concurrently, the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter also undergo reflex contraction and the detrusor muscles, smooth muscles located in the wall of the urinary bladder, undergo reflex relaxation, due to the activities of preganglionic sympathetic innervation from the intermediate cell column at spinal cord levels T12 to S2. The process of urination is facilitated by the micturition centers located in the cerebral cortex and the pons."
"As the bladder distends and the urine volume reaches a threshold level, sensory information reaches the ventral posterolateral  nucleus of the thalamus traveling via the medial lemniscal pathway, the dorsal column, and the anterolateral column. The information is transmitted by tertiary neurons from the thalamus to the postcentral sulcus and the individual becomes conscious of the need to urinate. When the individual is ready to void the retentive reflexes described above become inhibited, thus the internal and external sphincters relax."
"Additionally, projections from the pons activate the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the lateral horn of spinal cord levels S2–S4, whose post-ganglioic counterparts stimulate the detrusor muscles of the bladder to undergo contraction, thus emptying the urinary bladder. As feces accumulate, the sigmoid colon distends and the individual becomes conscious of the need to defecate, but the feces are retained in the colon by the two sphincter muscles, the internal smooth muscle sphincter and the external skeletal muscle sphincter. The former is supplied by postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the hypogastric plexus as well as by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers located in Auerbach’s plexus ."
"The external sphincter is supplied by the somatic nervous system, namely the inferior rectal nerve. Thus, when the sigmoid colon becomes distended, the internal sphincter muscle relaxes  and at the same time the external sphincter muscle contracts, preventing the feces from exiting the bowel. While the individual is asleep, this contraction of the external sphincter muscle is a reflex response."
"When the individual is awake, the contraction of the external sphincter is a voluntary response. When the individual is ready to defecate, the voluntary relaxation of the external sphincter, the peristaltic action of the sigmoid colon, and the intra-abdominal pressure created by contraction of the anterior abdominal wall musculature cooperate in expelling the feces from the sigmoid colon and the rectum through the anus. Erection of the penis and of the clitoris is an autonomic function initiated by tactile or psychogenic stimulation and mediated by parasympathetic innervation derived from sacral spinal cord levels."
"The parasympathetic fibers are responsible for engorgement of the spongy tissue of the penis and clitoris as well as of the vascular channels of the labia minora, and cause the release of secretions from the vaginal glands, lubricating the vagina. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers from spinal cord levels T10 to L2 synapse on postganglionic sympathetic nerve cell bodies housed in the inferior mesenteric ganglion. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from that ganglion are responsible in females for rhythmic contractions of the vagina and uterus, and in males for the release of secretions from the prostate gland and seminal vesicles as well as for ejaculation."
"Congenital megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung’s disease, is an excessive enlargement of the distal part of the colon due to the lack of, or a marked reduction in, the neuronal population in Auerbach’s myenteric plexus. Due to the absence of these neurons a region of the colon becomes constricted, the muscles cannot relax, and feces accumulate in the region of the colon proximal to the constriction. With the accumulation of feces the proximal region enlarges, resulting in megacolon."
"Horner’s syndrome is a condition resulting from damage to the cervical sympathetic trunk, sympathetic fibers of the carotid plexus, or any region of the spinal cord or brainstem involving the sympathetic pathways. The syndrome is characterized by the following conditions on the affected side: constriction of the pupil , lack of the ability to sweat , recession of the orb within the orbit , and drooping of the upper eyelid . It is interesting to note that cancer of the apex of the lung may involve the cervical sympathetic trunk, thus precipitating Horner’s syndrome."
Shy–Drager syndrome patients suffer from orthostatic hypertension and faint frequently because the autonomic nervous system neurons responsible for adjusting blood pressure during postural changes have either degenerated or died. These postural changes can involve the patient standing up from a reclining  position. Serologic testing confirmed that this patient had Lambert– Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
"This is an autoimmune condition. Acetylcholine is released at presynaptic peripheral nerve terminals in response to an action potential. The action potential at the presynaptic terminal opens voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to an influx of calcium, which leads to acetylcholine release."
"This acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse to reach receptors on the target organ. This is most apparent at the neuromuscular junction, where an action potential along the muscle membrane is induced by the released acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It occurs for both autonomic nerves as well as nerves supplying skeletal muscle, and the effects are seen at both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors."
"In Lambert–Eaton syndrome antibodies to the voltage-gated calcium channels are produced. This reduces calcium influx at the presynaptic terminal in response to an action potential, and acetylcholine release is therefore impaired. This produces both skeletal muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction."
"Common autonomic symptoms include dry mouth, dry eyes, impotence, heart rate irregularities, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension . Both parasympathetic and sympathetic function can be affected. Most often, however, it is the muscle weakness and fatigue that causes the most disability."
"Lambert–Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic disorder, meaning it is often associated with cancer. Small cell lung cancer is the one most often associated. The immune system is induced by an as yet undetermined mechanism to produce antibodies to the voltage-gated calcium channel."
"Therefore, a cancer work-up should be undertaken in all patients with this syndrome. In particular, this patient needs, at the least, a chest X-ray and/or chest CT since he has been a heavy smoker. Autonomic dysfunction can occur with many other conditions affecting acetylcholine release or metabolism."
"A major culprit is medication with anticholinergic effects . Botulism, which also reduces acetylcholine release at the presynaptic terminal, causes autonomic dysfunction as well as weakness. A 60-year-old woman complains of falls, imbalance, and numbness and tingling in her hands and legs."
There is also some incoordination of hand use and she has difficulty manipulating small items such as buttons. She is unable to play the piano now since she cannot position her fingers correctly on the piano keys. She thinks the strength in her arms and legs is adequate.
"Symptoms started with very slight tingling sensations, which she noticed about 5 years ago. The falls and difficulty walking have been present for about 2 months. Higher order cognitive functions are intact according to her husband."
"Her vision is normal. On examination, the patient shows normal mental status. Strength seems essentially normal throughout."
"Sensation, particularly to vibration and joint position, is severely diminished in the distal upper and lower limbs . Tendon reflexes are normal in the arms, but somewhat brisk in the legs at the knees and ankles. Gait is moderately ataxic and she has to reach out for support by touching the walls of the hallway at times."
"Fine movements of the fingers are performed poorly, even though finger and wrist strength seems normal. A variety of sensory receptors scattered throughout the body can become activated by exteroceptive, interoceptive, or proprioceptive input. Exteroceptive input relays sensory information about the body’s interaction with the external environment."
"Interoceptive input relays information about the body’s internal state, whereas proprioceptive input conveys information about position sense from the body and its component parts. Each receptor is specialized to detect mechanical, chemical, nociceptive , or thermal stimuli. Activation of a sensory receptor is converted into nerve impulses and this sensory input is then conveyed via the fibers of the cranial or spinal nerves to their respective relay nuclei in the central nervous system ."
"The sensory information is then further processed as it progresses, via the ascending sensory systems , to the cerebral cortex or to the cerebellum. Sensory information is also relayed to other parts of the CNS where it may function to elicit a reflex response, or may be integrated into pattern-generating circuitry. The ascending sensory pathways are classified according to the functional components  they carry as well as by their anatomical localization."
"The two functional categories are the general somatic afferent  system, which transmits sensory information such as touch, pressure, vibration, pain, temperature, stretch, and position sense from somatic structures; and the general visceral afferent  system, which transmits sensory information such as pressure, pain, and other visceral sensation from visceral structures. Anatomically, the ascending sensory systems consist of three distinct pathways: the anterolateral system , the dorsal column–medial lemniscal  pathway, and the somatosensory pathways to the cerebellum. The anterolateral system, which includes the spinothalamic, spinoreticular, spinomesencephalic, spinotectal, and spinohypothalamic tracts, relays predominantly pain and temperature sensation, as well as nondiscriminative  touch, pressure, and some proprioceptive sensation ."
"The dorsal column–medial lemniscal pathway  relays discriminative  tactile sense, vibratory sense, and position sense . The somatosensory pathways to the cerebellum, which include the anterior, posterior, and rostral spinocerebellar, as well as the cuneocerebellar tracts, relay primarily proprioceptive  information . The ascending sensory pathways are the main avenues by which information concerning the body’s interaction with the external environment, its internal condition, and the position and movement of its parts, reach the brain."
"One similarity shared by all three ascending sensory pathways from the body  is that the first order neuron cell bodies reside in the dorsal root ganglia. It is interesting to note that conscious perception of sensory information from external stimuli is mediated by the spinothalamic and DCML pathways to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus, whereas sensations that do not reach consciousness are mediated by the spinoreticular, spinomesencephalic, spinotectal, spinohypothalamic, and the anterior, posterior, and rostral spinocerebellar, and cuneocerebellar tracts. These tracts terminate in the reticular formation, mesencephalon, hypothalamus and cerebellum, respectively."
"Sensory input may ultimately elicit a reflex or other motor response because of the functional integration of the ascending  pathways, the cerebellum, and the somatosensory cortex, as well as the motor cortex and descending  pathways. Furthermore, descending projections from the somatosensory cortex, as well as from the raphe nucleus magnus and the dorsolateral pontine reticular formation to the somatosensory relay nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord, modulate the transmission of incoming sensory impulses to higher brain centers. This chapter includes a description of the sensory receptors and the ascending sensory pathways from the body, whereas the ascending sensory pathways from the head, transmitted mostly by the trigeminal system, are described in Chapter 15."
"Although sensory receptors vary according to their morphology, the velocity of conduction, and the modality to which they respond, as well as to their location in the body, they generally all function in a similar fashion. The stimulus to which a specific receptor responds causes an alteration in the ionic permeability of the nerve endings, generating a receptor potential that results in the formation of action potentials. This transformation of the stimulus into an electrical signal is referred to as sensory transduction."
"Some receptors that respond quickly and maximally at the onset of the stimulus, but stop responding even if the stimulus continues, are known as rapidly adapting  receptors. These are essential in responding to changes but they ignore ongoing processes, such as when one wears a wristwatch and ignores the continuous pressure on the skin of the wrist. However, there are other receptors, slowly adapting  receptors, that continue to respond as long as the stimulus is present."
"Sensory receptors are classified according to the source of the stimulus or according to the modality to which they respond. It is important to note that, in general, receptors do not transmit only one specific sensation. Receptors that are classified according to the source of the stimulus are placed in one of the following three categories: exteroceptors, proprioceptors, or interoceptors."
"Exteroceptors are close to the body surface and are specialized to detect sensory information from the external environment . Receptors in this class are sensitive to touch , pressure , temperature, pain, and vibration. Exteroceptors are further classified as teloreceptors or contact receptors: • teloreceptors , include receptors that respond to distant stimuli , and do not require direct physical contact with the stimulus in order to be stimulated; • contact receptors, which transmit tactile, pressure, pain, or thermal stimuli, require direct contact of the stimulus with the body."
"Proprioceptors transmit sensory information from muscles, tendons, and joints about the position of a body part, such as a limb in space. There is a static position sense relating to a stationary position and a kinesthetic sense , relating to the movement of a body part. The receptors of the vestibular system located in the inner ear, relaying sensory information about the movement and orientation of the head, are also classified as proprioceptors."
"Interoceptors detect sensory information concerning the status of the body’s internal environment, such as stretch, blood pressure, pH, oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration, and osmolarity. Receptors are further classified into the following three categories according to the modality to which they respond: nociceptors, thermoreceptors, and mechanoreceptors . Nociceptors are rapidly adapting receptors that are sensitive to noxious or painful stimuli."
"They are located at the peripheral terminations of lightly myelinated free nerve endings of type Aδ fibers, or unmyelinated type C fibers, transmitting pain. Nociceptors are further classified into three types. 1 Mechanosensitive nociceptors , which are sensitive to intense mechanical stimulation  or injury to tissues."
"2 Temperature-sensitive  nociceptors , which are sensitive to intense heat and cold. 3 Polymodal nociceptors , which are sensitive to noxious stimuli that are mechanical, thermal, or chemical in nature. Although most nociceptors are sensitive to one particular type of painful stimulus, some may respond to two or more types."
"Nociception is the reception of noxious sensory information elicited by tissue injury, which is transmitted to the CNS by nociceptors. Pain is the perception of discomfort or an agonizing sensation of variable magnitude, evoked by the stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Thermoreceptors are sensitive to warmth or cold."
"These slowly adapting receptors are further classified into three types. 1 Cold receptors, which consist of free nerve endings of lightly myelinated Aδ fibers. 2 Warmth receptors, which consist of the free nerve endings of unmyelinated C fibers that respond to increases in temperature."
"3 Temperature-sensitive nociceptors that are sensitive to excessive heat or cold. Mechanoreceptors, which comprise both exteroceptors and proprioceptors, are activated following physical deformation due to touch, pressure, stretch, or vibration of the skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules, in which they reside. A mechanoreceptor may be classified as nonencapsulated or encapsulated depending on whether a structural device encloses its peripheral nerve ending component."
"Free nerve endings  are present in the epidermis, dermis, cornea, dental pulp, mucous membranes of the oral and nasal cavities and of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint capsules, and bones. The peripheral nerve terminals of the free nerve endings lack Schwann cells and myelin sheaths. They are stimulated by touch, pressure, thermal, or painful stimuli."
"Peritrichial nerve endings  are specialized members of this category. They are large-diameter, myelinated, Aβ fibers that coil around a hair follicle below its associated sebaceous gland. This type of receptor is stimulated only when a hair is being bent."
"Tactile receptors  consist of disc-shaped, peripheral nerve endings of large-diameter, myelinated, Aβ fibers. Each disc-shaped terminal is associated with a specialized epithelial cell, the Merkel cell, located in the stratum basale of the epidermis. These receptors, frequently referred to as Merkel’s discs , are present mostly in glabrous , and occasionally in hairy skin."
"Merkel’s discs respond to discriminative touch stimuli that facilitate the distinguishing of texture, shape, and edges of objects. Encapsulated mechanoreceptors include Meissner’s corpuscles, pacinian corpuscles, and Ruffini’s end organs. Meissner’s corpuscles  are present in the dermal papillae of glabrous skin of the lips, forearm, palm, and sole, as well as in the connective tissue papillae of the tongue."
"These corpuscles consist of the peripheral terminals of Aβ fibers, which are encapsulated by a peanut-shaped structural device consisting of a stack of concentric Schwann cells surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. They are rapidly adapting and are sensitive to two-point tactile  discrimination, and are thus of great importance to the visually impaired by permitting them to be able to read Braille. Pacinian corpuscles , the largest of the mechanoreceptors, are rapidly adapting and resemble an onion in cross-section."
"Each Pacinian corpuscle consists of Aβ-fiber terminals encapsulated by layers of modified fibroblasts that are enclosed in a connective tissue capsule. Pacinian corpuscles are located in the dermis, hypodermis, interosseous membranes, ligaments, external genitalia, joint capsules, and peritoneum, as well as in the pancreas. They are more rapidly adapting than Meissner’s corpuscles and are believed to respond to pressure and vibratory stimuli, including tickling sensations."
"Ruffini’s end organs   are located in joint capsules, the dermis, and the underlying hypodermis of hairy skin. The unmyelinated peripheral terminals of Aβ myelinated fibers are slowly adapting. They intertwine around the core of collagen fibers, which is surrounded by a lamellated cellular capsule."
"Ruffini’s end organs respond to stretching of the collagen bundles in the skin or joint capsules and may provide proprioceptive information. Muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs  are also encapsulated mechanoreceptors, but, due to their specialized function, they are discussed separately. The mucle spindles and GTOs detect sensory input from the skeletal muscle and transmit it to the spinal cord where it plays an important role in reflex activity and motor control involving the cerebellum."
"In addition, sensory input from these muscle receptors is also relayed to the cerebral cortex by way of the DCML pathway, which mediates information concerning posture, position sense, as well as movement and orientation of the body and its parts. Extrafusal fibers are ordinary skeletal muscle cells constituting the majority of gross muscle, and their stimulation results in muscle contraction. Muscle spindles, composed of small bundles of encapsulated intrafusal fibers, are dispersed throughout gross muscle."
"These are dynamic stretch receptors that continuously check for changes in muscle length. Each muscle spindle is composed of two to 12 intrafusal fibers enclosed in a slender capsule, which in turn is surrounded by an outer fusiform connective tissue capsule whose tapered ends are attached to the connective tissue sheath surrounding the extrafusal muscle fibers . The compartment between the inner and outer capsules contains a glycosaminoglycan-rich viscous fluid."
"There are two types of intrafusal fibers based on their morphological characteristics: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Both nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers possess a central, noncontractile region housing multiple nuclei, and a skeletal muscle  contractile portion at each end of the central region. The nuclear bag fibers are larger, and their multiple nuclei are clustered in the “baglike” dilated central region of the fiber."
"The nuclear chain fibers are smaller and consist of multiple nuclei arranged sequentially, as in a “chain” of pearls, in the central region of the fiber. Each intrafusal fiber of a muscle spindle receives sensory innervation via the peripheral processes of pseudounipolar sensory neurons Each intrafusal fiber of a muscle spindle receives sensory innervation via the peripheral processes of pseudounipolar sensory neurons whose cell bodies are housed in dorsal root ganglia, or in the sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves . Since the large-diameter Aα fibers spiral around the noncontractile region of the intrafusal fibers, they are known as annulospiral or primary endings."
"These endings become activated at the beginning of muscle stretch or tension. In addition to the annulospiral endings, the intrafusal fibers, mainly the nuclear chain fibers, also receive smaller diameter, Aβ peripheral processes of pseudounipolar neurons. These nerve fibers terminate on both sides of the annulospiral ending, are referred to as secondary or flower spray endings, and are activated during the time that the stretch is in progress ."
"In addition to the sensory innervation, intrafusal fibers also receive motor innervation via gamma motoneurons  that innervate the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers, causing them to undergo contraction. Since the intrafusal fibers are oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the extrafusal fibers, when a muscle is stretched, the central, noncontractile region of the intrafusal fibers is also stretched, distorting and stimulating the sensory nerve endings coiled around them, causing the nerve endings to fire. However, when the muscle contracts, tension on the central noncontractile region of the intrafusal fibers decreases ."
"During voluntary muscle activity simultaneous stimulation of the extrafusal fibers by the alpha motoneurons, and the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers by the gamma motoneurons, serves to modulate the sensitivity of the intrafusal fibers. That is, the gamma motoneurons cause corresponding contraction of the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers, which stretch the central noncontractile region of the intrafusal fibers. Thus, the sensitivity of the intrafusal fibers is constantly maintained by continuously readapting to the most current status of muscle length."
"In this fashion the muscle spindles can detect a change in muscle length  irrespective of muscle length at the onset of muscle activity. It should be noted that even though they contract, the intrafusal fibers, due to their small number and size, do not contribute to any significant extent to the overall contraction of a gross muscle. The simple stretch reflex, whose mechanism is based on the role of the intrafusal fibers, functions to maintain muscle length caused by external disturbances."
"As a muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles are also stretched. This in turn stimulates the sensory afferent annulospiral and flower spray endings to transmit this information to those alpha motoneurons of the CNS  that innervate the agonist  muscle as well as to those motoneurons that innervate the antagonist muscle. The degree of stretching is proportional to  the load placed on the muscle."
"The larger the load, the more strongly the spindles are depolarized and the more extrafusal muscle fibers are in turn activated. As these alpha motoneurons of the stretched muscle fire, they stimulate the contraction of the required number of extrafusal muscle fibers of the agonist muscle. The alpha motoneurons of the antagonist muscle are inhibited so the antagonist muscle relaxes."
"The simple reflex arc involves the firing of only two neurons—an afferent sensory neuron and an efferent motoneuron—providing dynamic information concerning the changes of the load on the muscle and position of the body region in threedimensional space. Unlike muscle spindles, which are oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the extrafusal muscle fibers, GTOs are in series. Furthermore, GTOs do not receive motor innervation as the muscle spindles do."
"GTOs consist of interlacing intrafusal collagen bundles enclosed in a connective tissue capsule . A large-diameter, type Aα sensory fiber, whose cell body is housed in a dorsal root sensory ganglion or a cranial nerve sensory ganglion, passes through the capsule and then branches into numerous delicate terminals that are interposed among the intrafusal collagen bundles. The central processes of these Aα afferent neurons enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves to terminate and establish synaptic contacts with inhibitory interneurons that, in turn, synapse with alpha motoneurons supplying the contracted agonist muscle."
"During muscle contraction, as the muscle shortens, tension is produced in the tendons anchoring that muscle to bone, compressing the nerve fiber terminals interposed among the inelastic intrafusal collagen fibers. This compression activates the sensory terminals in the GTOs, which transmit this sensory information to the CNS, providing proprioceptive information concerning muscle activity and preventing the placement of excessive forces on the muscle and tendon. In contrast, the noncontractile portions of the muscle spindles are not stretched, and are consequently undisturbed."
"The contractile regions of the muscle spindles, however, undergo corresponding contraction that enables them to detect a future change in muscle length . During slight stretching of a relaxed muscle, the muscle spindles are stimulated whereas the GTOs remain undisturbed and quiescent. During further stretching of the muscle, which produces tension on the tendons, both the muscle spindles and the GTOs are stimulated."
"Thus GTOs monitor and check the amount of tension exerted on the muscle , whereas muscle spindles check muscle fiber length and rate of change of muscle length . The anterolateral system  transmits nociceptive, thermal, and nondiscriminatory  touch information to higher brain centers , generally by a sequence of three neurons and interneurons . The neuron sequence consists of: 1 A first order neuron  whose cell body is located in a dorsal root ganglion."
"It transmits sensory information from peripheral structures to the dorsal  horn of the spinal cord. 2 A second order neuron whose cell body is located within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and whose axon usually decussates and ascends: • in the direct pathway of the ALS  to synapse in the contralateral thalamus, and sending some collaterals to the reticular formation; • in the indirect pathway of the ALS  to synapse in the reticular formation, and sending some collaterals to the thalamus; or • as spinomesencephalic, spinotectal, or spinohypothalamic fibers to synapse in several brainstem nuclei. 3 A third order neuron whose cell body is located in the thalamus, and whose axon ascends ipsilaterally to terminate in the somatosensory cortex."
"In some cases, the first order neuron may synapse with an interneuron that resides entirely within the dorsal horn, and whose axon synapses with the second order neuron. Receptors that transmit nociceptive information consist of high-threshold free nerve endings ramifying near the external surface and internal environment of the organism. These are dendritic arborizations of small, pseudounipolar, first order neurons  whose somata are housed in a dorsal root ganglion."
"The peripheral processes of these pseudounipolar neurons consist of two main types of fiber : 1 Thinly myelinated Aδ  fibers, which relay sharp, short-term, well-localized pain . These fibers transmit sensations that do not elicit an affective component associated with the experience. 2 Unmyelinated C  fibers, which relay dull, persistent, poorly localized pain ."
"These fibers transmit sensations that elicit an affective response. The central processes of these pseudounipolar neurons enter the spinal cord at the dorsal root entry zone, via the lateral division of the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves, and upon entry collectively form the dorsolateral fasciculus , which is present at all spinal cord levels. These central processes bifurcate into short ascending and descending branches."
"These branches either ascend or descend one to three spinal cord levels within this tract, to terminate in their target laminae of the dorsal horn, where they synapse with second order neurons . Therefore, although stimulation of the peripheral endings of fibers carried by one spinal nerve may enter the spinal cord at a specific spinal level, collaterals of the ascending and descending branches spread the signal to neighboring spinal levels above and below the level of entry. These collaterals play an important function in intersegmental reflexes."
"The cell bodies of the second order neurons transmitting nociception reside in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . Recent findings indicate that the axons of these second order neurons course in either the direct  or indirect  pathways of the ALS, or as three sets of fibers : the spinomesencephalic, spinotectal, or spinohypothalamic fibers. Approximately 15% of nociceptive fibers project directly to the thalamus whereas 85% project to the thalamus via a relay in the reticular formation."
"Type Aδ fibers of first order neurons synapse primarily with second order neurons in lamina I  and lamina V  of the spinal cord gray matter. However, many first order neurons synapse with spinal cord interneurons that are associated with reflex motor activity. The axons of the second order neurons flow across the midline to the contralateral side of the spinal cord in the anterior white commissure, forming the spinothalamic tract ."
"The spinothalamic tract transmits not only nociceptive input, but also thermal and nondiscriminative  touch input to the contralateral ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. It also sends some projections to the ventral posterior inferior, and the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. Although the spinothalamic tract ends at the thalamus, as it ascends through the brainstem it also sends collaterals to the reticular formation."
"Since the spinothalamic tract  is phylogenetically a newer pathway, it is referred to as the neospinothalamic pathway. Only about 15% of the nociceptive fibers from the spinal cord, ascending in the ALS and carrying nociceptive information, terminate directly in the thalamus via the spinothalamic tract. Although referred to as the “spinothalamic tract,” it actually consists of two anatomically distinct tracts: the lateral spinothalamic tract  and the very small anterior spinothalamic tract ."
"Earlier studies indicated that the lateral spinothalamic tract transmitted only nociceptive and thermal input, whereas the anterior spinothalamic tract transmitted only nondiscriminative  touch. Recent studies however, support the finding that both the anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts , transmit nociceptive, thermal, and nondiscriminative  tactile signals to higher brain centers. Type C fibers of first order neurons terminate on interneurons in laminae II  and III of the dorsal horn."
"Axons of these interneurons synapse with second order neurons in laminae V–VIII. Many of the axons of these second order neurons ascend ipsilaterally, however a small number of axons sweep to the opposite side of the spinal cord in the anterior white commissure. These axons form the more prominent ipsilateral and smaller contralateral spinoreticular tracts."
"The spinoreticular tracts transmit nociceptive, thermal, and nondiscriminatory  touch signals from the spinal cord to the thalamus indirectly, by forming multiple synapses in the reticular formation prior to their thalamic projections. Since the spinoreticular tract  is phylogenetically an older pathway, it is referred to as the paleospinothalamic pathway . The spinoreticular tract is a bilateral  tract that conveys sensory information to the brainstem reticular formation, the region responsible for producing arousal and wakefulness, thus alerting the organism following an injury."
"Impulses from the reticular formation are then relayed bilaterally to the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, via reticulothalamic fibers. Since these nuclei lack somatotopic organization, there is only an indistinct localization of sensory signals carried by this pathway. The reticular formation and its continuation into the diencephalon, the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, are components of the reticular-activating system ."
"The RAS functions in activating the organism’s entire nervous system, so as to elicit responses that will enable it to evade painful stimuli. In addition, there are some second order neurons from the dorsal horn that bypass the reticular formation and relay sensory input from C fibers directly to the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. The spinomesencephalic fibers terminate in the periaqueductal gray matter and the midbrain raphe nuclei, both of which are believed to give rise to fibers that modulate nociceptive transmission and are thus collectively referred to as the “descending pain-inhibiting system” ."
"Furthermore, some spinomesencephalic fibers terminate in the parabrachial nucleus, which sends fibers to the amygdala—a component of the limbic system associated with the processing of emotions. Via their connections to the limbic system, the spinomesencephalic fibers play a role in the emotional component of pain. The spinotectal fibers terminate mainly in the deep layers of the superior colliculus."
"The superior colliculi have the reflex function of turning the upper body, head, and eyes in the direction of a painful stimulus . The spinohypothalamic fibers ascend to the hypothalamus where they synapse with neurons that give rise to the hypothalamospinal tract. This pathway is associated with the autonomic and reflex responses  to nociception ."
"Approximately 85% of the nociceptive fibers from the spinal cord ascending in the ALS, terminate in the brainstem reticular formation. From there, the information eventually reaches the thalamus via multiple additional synapses that occur in the brainstem. The reticular formation sends fibers transmitting nociceptive input not only to the thalamus but also to the hypothalamus, which is associated with the autonomic and reflex responses to nociception, and the limbic system, which mediates the emotional component of nociception."
"The ventral posterior lateral nucleus gives rise to fibers that course in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and in the corona radiata to terminate in the postcentral gyrus  of the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex. Additionally, the ventral posterior lateral nucleus also sends some direct projections to the secondary somatosensory cortex, S-II . The ventral posterior inferior nucleus projects mostly to the secondary somatosensory cortex , although some of its fibers terminate in the primary somatosensory cortex ."
"The intralaminar nuclei send fibers to the striatum , the S-I and S-II, as well as to the cingulate gyrus and the prefrontal cortex. It should be noted that most of the nociception-relaying fibers arriving at the intralaminar nuclei transmit nociceptive information relayed there from the reticular formation. Multiple synapses have been formed in the reticular formation prior to synapsing in the intralaminar nuclei, and thus, strictly speaking, the intralaminar relay neurons for this pathway are not the third order neurons in the sequence, but they function as if they were third order neurons."
"The primary somatosensory cortex  consists of the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe, which corresponds to Brodmann’s areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2 . The secondary somatosensory cortex  consists of Brodmann’s area 43, located on the superior bank of the lateral fissure, at the inferior extent of the primary motor and sensory areas. Axons of the thalamic third order neurons terminate in somatotopically corresponding regions of the primary somatosensory cortex."
"Regions of the head are represented in the inferior half of the postcentral gyrus near the lateral fissure, whereas those of the upper limb and the trunk are represented in its superior half. The lower limb is represented in the medial surface of the postcentral gyrus, and the perineum in the paracentral lobule. The body areas with the largest cortical area representation are the head and upper limb, reflecting the great discriminative capability that structures in these regions possess ."
"In summary, nociceptive signals relayed from the spinal cord directly to the ventral posterior lateral, the ventral posterior inferior, and the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus via the spinothalamic tract  are transmitted to the somatosensory cortex . The postcentral gyrus is the site where processing of pain localization, intensity, quality, and sensory integration takes place at the conscious level. The primary somatosensory cortex sends projections to the secondary somatosensory cortex, which is believed to have an important function in the memory of sensory input."
"In contrast, nociceptive signals relayed from the spinal cord to the reticular formation via the spinoreticular tracts  are then transmitted to: • the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus , which in turn project to the primary somesthetic cortex; • the hypothalamus; and • the limbic system. The projections through the reticular formation function in the arousal of the organism in response to nociceptive input, whereas the projections to the hypothalamus and limbic system have an important function in the autonomic, reflex, and emotional  responses to a painful experience. Cerebral imaging studies such as electroencephalography , functional magnetic resonance imaging , magnetoencephalography , and positron emission tomography  have demonstrated that nociceptive signals are not only processed at the primary and secondary omatosensory cortices, but also in the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insular cortex, and even the supplemental motor area of the motor cortex."
"The anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices are connected with the limbic cortex, which plays a role in the emotional aspect of pain. A striking characteristic of the brain is that although it receives and processes nociceptive information, the brain itself has no sensation of pain. During brain surgery, the patient is often awake and has no pain sensation from the brain tissue itself."
"The structures that have to be anesthetized during brain surgery are the dura mater, the bones of the skull, and the extracranial soft tissues. Moreover, although the internal  organs themselves have no pain receptors, pain receptors are present embedded in the walls of the arteries serving these organs. Visceral pain is characterized as diffuse and poorly localized, and is often “referred to” and felt in another somatic structure distant or near the source of visceral pain."
"Nociceptive signals from the viscera generally follow the same pathway as signals arising from somatic structures. General visceral afferent nociceptive information from visceral structures of the trunk is carried mostly by type C, Aδ, or Aβ fibers . The peripheral terminals of these fibers are associated with Pacinian corpuscles that respond to excessive stretching of the intestinal wall, a lesion in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, or to smooth muscle spasm."
"The cell bodies of these sensory , first order neurons are housed in the dorsal root ganglia, and their central processes carry the information, via the dorsolateral fasciculus , to the dorsal horn and lateral gray matter of the spinal cord. Here, these central processes synapse with second order neurons as well as with neurons associated with reflex activities. The axons of the second order neurons join the anterolateral system to relay nociceptive signals from visceral structures to the reticular formation and the thalamus."
"Fibers from the reticular formation project to the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which in turn project to the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus. Recall that the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus lack somatotopic organization, resulting in only an indistinct localization of sensory signals carried by this pathway. Visceral pain signals relayed to the primary somatosensory cortex may be associated with referred pain to a somatic structure."
"In addition to projections to the somatosensory cortex, recent studies indicate that nociceptive signals are also relayed to the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices, two cortical areas implicated in the processing of visceral pain. Temperature sensory input is transmitted to the CNS via unmyelinated C fibers that are activated by warm stimuli, or by lightly myelinated Aδ fibers that are activated by cold stimuli . All fibers enter the spinal cord at the dorsal root entry zone in the lateral division of the dorsal root of the spinal nerves."
"These fibers accompany nociceptive fibers and, upon entering the spinal cord, join the dorsolateral fasciculus . In the dorsolateral fasciculus, they bifurcate into short ascending and descending fibers. These fibers ascend or descend respectively, one to three spinal cord levels to synapse in laminae I, II, and III of the dorsal horn gray matter."
"Temperature input is relayed to interneurons which, in turn, transmit the information to second order neurons in lamina V. The axons of the second order neurons, accompanied by nociceptive fibers, decussate in the anterior white commissure to join the contralateral anterolateral system. Some of these fibers ascend to terminate in the brainstem reticular formation; however, most terminate primarily in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus."
"Third order neuron fibers from the thalamus relay thermal sensory information to the somesthetic cortex. Tactile sensation is divisible into nondiscriminative  touch and discriminative  touch. Crude touch, transmitted via the ALS , is sensed following gentle stroking of the skin with a fine cotton strand, but this sensation does not include detailed information about the stimulus."
"Tactile examination of an object is dependent on discriminative  touch sense, which enables one to detect fine detail regarding the location, size, shape, and texture of an object even when the eyes are closed. Conscious proprioception may be categorized into static and dynamic proprioception. Static proprioception  is the awareness of the position of a body part such as a limb, whereas dynamic proprioception  is the awareness of movement of a body part, and balance."
"Discriminative  touch, pressure, vibratory sense, as well as proprioceptive sensory information are transmitted to higher brain centers, reaching consciousness, by three neurons arranged in sequence . 1 A first order neuron  whose cell body is located in a dorsal root ganglion. The neuron transmits sensory information from the periphery to the spinal cord  and to the dorsal column nuclei ."
"2 A second order neuron whose cell body is located in the dorsal column nuclei in the medulla, and whose axon decussates and ascends to terminate in the contralateral thalamus. 3 A third order neuron whose cell body resides in the thalamus, and whose axon ascends ipsilaterally to terminate in the somatosensory cortex. The specifics of these pathways are discussed below."
"The receptors that transmit discriminative  touch, pressure, and conscious proprioception information consist of: • free nerve endings responding to touch, pressure, and proprioception in the skin, muscles, and joint capsules; • tactile  discs responding to touch and pressure in the skin; • peritrichial endings stimulated by touch of the hair follicles; • Meissner’s corpuscles activated by touch of the skin; and • Pacinian corpuscles stimulated by touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception in the deep layers of the skin, and in visceral structures. These first order pseudounipolar neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia, send peripheral processes to somatic or visceral structures. These peripheral processes are medium-size type Aβ and large-size type Aα fibers."
"Upon being stimulated, the peripheral processes transmit the sensory information to the spinal cord by way of the central processes of the pseudounipolar neurons, which enter the spinal cord at the dorsal root entry zone via the medial division of the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. Upon entry into the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord, the afferent fibers bifurcate into long ascending and short descending fibers. The long ascending and short descending fibers give rise to collateral branches that may synapse with several distinct cell groups of the dorsal horn interneurons and with ventral horn motoneurons."
"These fibers collectively form the dorsal column pathways, either the fasciculus gracilis or the fasciculus cuneatus, depending on the level of the spinal cord in which they enter. The central processes that enter the spinal cord below level T6 include the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral levels. They bring information from the lower limb and lower half of the trunk."
"The central processes enter the ipsilateral fasciculus gracilis  and ascend to the medulla to terminate in the ipsilateral nucleus gracilis. It should be recalled that the fasciculus gracilis is present in the entire length of the spinal cord. The central processes that enter the spinal cord at level T6 and above bring information from the upper thoracic and cervical levels, that is from the upper half of the trunk and upper limb."
"These central processes enter the ipsilateral fasciculus cuneatus  and ascend to the medulla to synapse with second order neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus cuneatus. It should be noted that the fasciculus cuneatus is present only at the upper six thoracic and at all cervical spinal cord levels. As the descending fibers of all of the first order neurons descend to various spinal cord levels within the fasciculus gracilis or the fasciculus cuneatus, they give rise to collateral branches along the way."
"These collateral branches form synapses with interneurons and alpha motoneurons, thus participating in intersegmental reflexes. The first order fibers terminating in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus synapse with second order neurons whose cell bodies are housed in these nuclei. The fibers of the second order neurons form the internal arcuate fibers as they curve ventromedially through the reticular formation to the opposite side."
"These fibers ascend as the medial lemniscus  in the caudal part of the medulla, cranial to the prominent pyramidal  decussation, to synapse with third order neurons in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. The ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus houses the cell bodies of the third order neurons of the DCML pathway. The fibers arising from the thalamus ascend in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the corona radiata to terminate in the primary somatosensory cortex of the postcentral gyrus ."
"Brodmann’s area 3b receives most of the projections arising from the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and is the site where the initial cortical processing of tactile discrimination input takes place. Brodmann’s area 3b in turn projects to Brodmann’s areas 1 and 2. Area 1 is responsible for determining the texture and area 2 the size and shape of objects."
"In contrast, area 3a is stimulated by signals arising from muscle spindles and is believed to participate in motor functions. The primary somatosensory cortex projects to the secondary somatosensory cortex, located on the superior border of the lateral fissure. Some third order neuron fibers from the thalamus terminate directly in the secondary somatosensory cortex."
"Only a small portion of the proprioceptive information enters consciousness. Most of the proprioceptive information does not reach conscious levels, and instead is transmitted directly to the cerebellum via the ascending somatosensory cerebellar pathways without projecting to the thalamus or the cerebral cortex. These pathways, which process subconscious proprioception from muscles, tendons, and joints, are two-neuron pathways, consisting of first order and second order neurons."
"The pathways include : the dorsal  spinocerebellar tract, the cuneocerebellar tract, the ventral  spinocerebellar tract, and the rostral spinocerebellar tract. The primary function of the dorsal  spinocerebellar tract  is to relay proprioceptive input from the neuromuscular spindles and GTOs of the ipsilateral trunk and lower limb, to the cerebellum. It should be recalled, however, that it also relays some touch and pressure sensation from the skin of the ipsilateral trunk and lower limb."
"First order neurons  whose cell bodies are housed in the dorsal root ganglia send their peripheral processes to the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints. Here they perceive proprioceptive information, which is then transmitted to the spinal cord by their central processes. These central processes join the medial division of the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves to synapse in the nucleus dorsalis  at their level of entry."
"Sensory information transmitted by spinal nerves entering at the sacral and lower lumbar spinal cord levels  is relayed to the caudal extent of the nucleus dorsalis  by ascending in the fasciculus gracilis. Clark’s column houses the cell bodies of second order neurons whose axons form the dorsal spinocerebellar tract, which ascends ipsilaterally in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. When this tract reaches the brainstem it joins the restiform body , and then passes  into the vermis of the cerebellum."
"The dorsal spinocerebellar tract relays proprioceptive information directly to the cerebellum where this information is processed; it plays an important role in the coordination of movements of individual lower limb muscles and in the maintenance of posture. Proprioceptive sensory information from the neck, upper limb, and upper half of the trunk enters at spinal cord segments C2 to T5. The central processes of the pseudounipolar first order neurons ascend in the fasciculus cuneatus and terminate in the external  cuneate nucleus—the nucleus dorsalis of Clark homologue at cervical levels above C8 ."
"The axons of the second order neurons, whose cell bodies are housed in the accessory cuneate nucleus, form the cuneocerebellar tract. This tract is referred to as the neck and upper limb counterpart of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract. Fibers of the cuneocerebellar tract join the restiform body  and then enter the anterior lobe of the cerebellum ipsilaterally."
"Information carried by the cuneocerebellar tract plays a role in movements of the head and upper limbs. The ventral  spinocerebellar tract relays proprioceptive information from the muscle spindles and GTOs of the trunk and lower limb. It functions in the coordination of movement of the lower limb, and maintenance of posture ."
"First order neurons  transmit sensory input to laminae V–VII of the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spinal cord levels, where they terminate and synapse with second order neurons. The axons of these second order neurons, known as spinal border cells, form the ventral  spinocerebellar tract, which decussates in the anterior white commissure and ascends in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord to the medulla. At pontine levels these fibers join the superior cerebellar peduncle to pass as “mossy fibers” into the vermis of the cerebellum."
These fibers then decussate again to their actual side of origin within the cerebellum. Proprioceptive information from the head and upper limb is transmitted to C4–C8 spinal cord levels. The central processes of first order neurons synapse with second order neurons whose cell bodies reside in lamina VII of the dorsal horn.
"The fibers of the second order neurons form the primarily uncrossed rostral spinocerebellar tract, the head and upper limb counterpart of the ventral spinocerebellar tract. These fibers join the restiform body  to enter the cerebellum. Additionally, some fibers pass into the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle ."
"This tract plays a role in movement of the head and upper limb. The extent of damage that may occur to a peripheral nerve, and the sensory symptoms that will arise following a lesion, differ depending on whether the damaged nerve carries sensory fibers and which fibers are involved in the lesion. Diminished cutaneous sensation due to damage of the sensory fibers of a particular nerve is usually narrower than the range of distribution of the nerve, due to the overlapping areas of distribution of adjacent nerves."
"The sensory deficits that arise following a lesion to a dorsal root or to a spinal nerve are usually revealed in a segmental distribution . Since peripheral nerves branch and extend their innervation into territories of adjacent nerves, a peripheral nerve lesion may include areas supplied by several adjacent spinal cord levels. Due to this innervation overlap, it is difficult to trace the sensory deficit to a single spinal nerve or dorsal root."
"Dorsal root irritation results in pain and paresthesia , such as tingling, itching, or pricking of the skin. In order to be able to identify the site of a spinal cord lesion, one has to be familiar with the anatomical arrangement of the various ascending and descending tracts in the spinal cord. In general, the pathways relaying pain, temperature, and nondiscriminative  touch from the body, ascend in the opposite side of origin, in the anterolateral aspect of the spinal cord."
"Pathways relaying discriminative  touch and proprioceptive modalities ascend ipsilateral to the side of origin, in the dorsal white columns. Although spinal cord injuries are rarely limited to a particular tract, quadrant, or side of the spinal cord, the hemisection of the spinal cord is used for instructive purposes. One such example is the Brown-Séquard syndrome ."
"When the spinal cord is hemisected , all of the tracts  coursing through the level of the lesion are severed, and the following will be observed. 1 The lower motoneurons ipsilateral to and at the level of the lesion will be damaged, leading to ipsilateral lower motoneuron paralysis at the level of the lesion. 2 Since the corticospinal tract  will be severed, the individual will exhibit an ipsilateral loss of motor function below the level of the lesion, followed by spastic paralysis ."
"For sensory deficits at or below the level of the lesion, the following will be observed. 1 Since the anterolateral system  has been severed, there will be a contralateral loss of: • pain and temperature sensation beginning one or two segments below the level of the lesion; and • nondiscriminative  touch sensation beginning three to four segments below the level of the lesion. 2 Since the dorsal column pathways  have been severed, there will be an ipsilateral loss of the following, below the level of the lesion: • discriminative  touch; • vibratory sensation; • proprioceptive  sensation: an individual with this type of lesion will have coordination difficulties ; if the lesion involves the sensory innervation of the lower limbs the individual will have difficulty in maintaining his balance when his feet are closely approximated and when his eyes are closed ; • astereognosis  : an individual with astereognosis is unable to identify the shape and form of a known object  following manual examination with the eyes closed, but can identify the object by sight; and • two-point discrimination: the individual is unable to perceive simultaneous stimulation by a blunt instrument at two separate points on the skin as two distinct points of stimulation."
"Since crude touch is carried by more than one ascending sensory pathway, ascending on both sides of the spinal cord, some touch sensation remains intact in individuals with Brown-Séquard syndrome. Furthermore, if only the dorsal right quadrant of the spinal cord is damaged, pain and temperature sensation will not be affected, whereas there will be a loss of discriminative  touch and proprioceptive sensation, below the level of the lesion on the ipsilateral  side of the body. Tabes dorsalis, a form of tertiary neurosyphilis, is a rare condition which is manifested during the second decade after an individual becomes infected with the microorganism causing syphilis."
"This condition is characterized by sensory ataxia  resulting from impairment of two-point discrimination, vibratory sense, position sense, and kinesthesis. Individuals with this condition find it necessary to look at their lower limbs during walking. Additionally, they have difficulty standing up straight if their feet are closely approximated when their eyes are closed, or if they are standing in the dark ."
"There is also degeneration of the large-diameter, heavily myelinated fibers coursing in the medial division of the dorsal root; thus sensory information from the mechanoreceptors to the ascending sensory pathways is also affected . Additionally, these individuals experience abnormal pain sensations. Friedreich’s ataxia is a hereditary disorder that is manifested prior to, or during, puberty."
"In this condition, the spinocerebellar tracts as well as the dorsal column pathways degenerate and, consequently, produce an increasingly deteriorating ataxia. In subacute combined degeneration, as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency, both the corticospinal tracts and the dorsal column pathways undergo degeneration. The deficits in the affected individual are characterized by muscle weakness as a result of the degeneration of the corticospinal  tracts, and loss of vibratory sense, two-point discrimination, and proprioception as a result of the degeneration of the dorsal column pathways."
"Syringomyelia  is a disease in which the central canal of the spinal cord, usually at the lower cervical or upper thoracic spinal cord levels, becomes enlarged  . The enlarging canal stretches and damages the surrounding nerve tissue. The tissue affected first is the anterior white commissure containing crossing fibers, followed by the damage to the anterior horn."
"This results in: 1 Loss of pain and temperature sensation from the skin of both shoulders and upper extremities due to the destruction of the second order neuron decussating fibers that relay pain and temperature input. If the lesion involves only the cervical levels of the spinal cord, the anterior surface of the arm and forearm is not affected since it is innervated by T1 and T2. 2 Weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hands due to the degeneration of the motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord."
"If the disease progresses to include additional spinal cord levels and more nerve tissue surrounding the increasingly enlarged space, additional deficits will become apparent. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery, either by a thrombus or by compression, will obstruct blood flow to the ventral two-thirds of the spinal cord, and will result in infarction . If the anterior spinal artery is occluded or compressed near the artery’s origin in the medulla, structures located in the anterior aspect of the medulla, such as the pyramid and medial lemnisci, will be affected."
"Damage of the corticospinal fibers in the pyramid above its decussation will result in contralateral hemiparesis. Damage of the medial lemniscus will result in loss of proprioception and vibratory sense from the opposite side of the body. If occlusion or compression of the anterior spinal artery occurs at spinal levels, it will result in damage of the corticospinal tract fibers and the anterior horns of the spinal cord."
"This is characterized by motor function deficits ipsilateral to, and below, the level of the lesion. Since the dorsal column pathways are not affected by occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at spinal levels, discriminatory  touch and position sense remain intact. The two posterior spinal arteries supply the dorsal one-third of the spinal cord ."
"If one or both of the posterior spinal arteries is/are occluded or compressed, it results in infarction of the dorsal white columns and the ALS. If only one of the posterior spinal arteries is occluded, or compressed, it will result in loss of discriminatory  touch and proprioceptive sensation, ipsilaterally, and loss of pain and temperature sensation, contralaterally, below the level of the lesion. If infarction occurs at caudal medullary levels, near the level of the vessels’ origin, the dorsal white columns and their respective nuclei will be damaged."
"Since the spinothalamic tract is located in the anterolateral aspect of the caudal medulla, it is not affected. Lesions involving the spinothalamic tract and its nucleus of termination, the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus, may initially cause diminished or complete loss of touch, pressure, pain, or temperature sensation, or proprioception from the contralateral side of the body. Spontaneous, inexplicable, agonizing pain and other unusual sensations in the anesthetic parts may follow."
"This condition is known as central pain . Isolated lesions in the postcentral gyrus are uncommon. However, since the postcentral gyrus is supplied by branches of the middle cerebral artery, a vessel which often becomes occluded, this region of the brain may become infarcted."
"A lesion to the primary somatosensory cortex will result in contralateral loss of: 1 Two-point discrimination. 2 Graphesthesia, the ability to recognize letters or numbers as they are stroked on the skin. 3 Stereognosis, the ability to identify a known object following tactile examination without looking."
"4 Vibratory sense. 5 Position sense. Furthermore, although the individual has a minimal impairment of pain, temperature, and touch sensation, he is unable to localize the stimulus."
"Since pain perception is not only processed in the somatosensory cortex, but also in the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices, pain sensation persists following a lesion to the somatosensory cortex as a result of these additional cortical representations of pain. In recent years, a bilateral cingulotomy  has served as an effective treatment in relieving the emotional, agonizing reaction to pain. An isolated lesion in the secondary somatosensory cortex  results in minimal sensory loss, but since S-II has an important function in memory of somatosensory information and sensory integration, these functions are impaired."
"The actual origin of visceral pain is imprecisely localized. Although pain may originate deep within a visceral structure, such as the heart, the pain may be “referred to,” and felt, in another, distant somatic structure such as the left upper limb. Although several explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon, the following two have the most prominence in the field of neuroscience."
"The convergence–projection theory of visceral pain, suggests that the central processes of pseudounipolar sensory, general visceral afferent  neurons supplying visceral structures and the central processes of general somatic afferent  neurons from a somatic structure, such as the upper limb, enter and terminate at the same spinal cord level. Here they converge on and synapse with the same interneurons and/or second order neurons  of the ascending pain pathways in the dorsal horn, and the intermediate gray matter. Nociceptive information is transmitted by these GSA pathways to higher brain centers."
"Second order GSA projection neurons are continuously being activated by GVA first order neurons, thereby lowering the threshold of stimulation of the second order neurons. Consequently, nociceptive sensory information is relayed by the neurons of the GSA pathway to higher brain centers. Thus, GVA nociceptive input is transmitted via the spinoreticular fibers to the reticular formation, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus."
"The nociceptive signal is subsequently relayed to the region of the somesthetic cortex that normally receives somatic information from other areas, such as the upper limb, and the brain interprets it as if the pain were coming from that somatic structure . Therefore, it is the area of the cerebral cortex, in this case the somatosensory cortex, wherein the signals terminate, and not the stimulus, the receptor, or the information, that establishes the localization of the sensation. A curious phenomenon has been reported by individuals who have had a limb amputated."
"These individuals experience pain or tingling sensations that feel as if they were coming from the amputated limb, just as if that limb were still present. Although the mechanism of phantom limb pain is not understood, the following two possible explanations are offered. If a sensory pathway is activated anywhere along its course, nerve impulses are generated that travel to the CNS where they initiate neural activity."
"This neural activity ultimately “creates” sensations that feel as though they originated in the nonexistent limb. Another possibility is that since there is no touch, pressure, or proprioceptive information transmitted to the CNS from the peripheral processes of the sensory neurons that initially innervated the amputated limb, there are no impulses from touch fibers to attenuate the relaying of nociceptive impulses to the nociceptive pathways, enhancing nociceptive transmission and pain sensation . Since nociception is not as localized, cortical areas corresponding to the phantom limb will be activated."
"Although the CNS is constantly flooded with sensory information, it can prevent and/or suppress the flow of some of the incoming nociceptive signals at the local circuitry level of the spinal cord dorsal horn . The CNS can also do this at the level of the descending opioid and nonopioid analgesia-producing pathways that originate in the brainstem, and terminate at the relay sensory nuclei of the ascending sensory systems. Rubbing a painful area  reduces the sensation of pain."
"It has been proposed that the substantia gelatinosa  of the dorsal horn gray matter is the site where pain is filtered by modulation of the sensory nociceptive input to the spinothalamic pain and temperature pathway neurons. The theory proposed to explain this phenomenon, known as the gate control theory of pain, suggests that the neural circuitry of the substantia gelatinosa  functions as follows . The activity of nociceptive unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated Aδ fibers terminating in the SG transmit nociceptive impulses by:  inhibiting the SG inhibitory interneuron; and  simultaneously activating the second order spinothalamic tract neuron that projects to the thalamus, “keeping the gate open."
"” The touch Aδ/Aβ myelinated fibers activate the inhibitory interneuron as well as the second order neuron. However, the inhibitory interneuron, via presynaptic inhibition of the C/Aδ and Aδ/Aβ fibers, prevents impulses from reaching the second order spinothalamic neuron. When someone injures his fingers, for example, he usually rubs the painful area."
"The rubbing probably stimulates the Aδ/Aβ fibers, which in turn—via the inhibitory interneuron—inhibit the transmission of some of the nociceptive impulses to higher brain centers, providing some relief from pain. Although it was known for many years that opiates, a group of drugs derived from opium  provide powerful relief from pain, their mode of action was not understood. It is now known that the opiates bind to “opiate receptors” on specific nerve cells residing in certain areas of the CNS."
"It was then speculated that, for the nervous system to have “opiate receptors,” it must synthesize its own endogenous, opiate-like substances that bind to the “opiate receptors,” which probably modulate afferent nociceptive transmission. Three groups of related endogenous opioid peptides have been identified: enkephalin , beta-endorphin , and dynorphin  all of which are known to bind to the same receptors as the opioid drugs. During a stressful or emotional experience, regions associated with the processing of emotions—namely the telencephalon , the diencephalon , and the limbic system—project to and stimulate the enkephalin-releasing neurons of the periaqueductal gray matter and other nearby regions of the midbrain."
"The axons of these enkephalin-releasing neurons form excitatory synapses primarily with the serotonin-releasing neurons of the raphe nucleus magnus and the nucleus gigantocellularis of the rostral medullary reticular formation. Since these neurons release serotonin, they are said to form the serotonergic-opioid peptide analgesic system, which modulates nociception. In addition to the serotonergicopioid peptide analgesic system, there is a norepinephrine  analgesic system that arises from the dorsolateral pontine reticular formation and terminates in the SG of the spinal cord, and also functions in modulating nociception ."
"The axons of the serotonin-releasing neurons from the raphe nucleus magnus and the nucleus gigantocellularis descend bilaterally in the lateral funiculus of all spinal cord levels to terminate in the SG of the dorsal horn. Here they form excitatory synapses with the inhibitory interneurons, which release the opioid peptides, enkephalin or dynorphin. These interneurons establish axoaxonic synapses with the central processes of the Aδ and C first order nociceptive neurons."
"The modulation of nociception occurs in the following fashion. Upon stimulation of the free nerve ending of a pain fiber, the central process of this first order neuron releases substance P, a neurotransmitter believed to function in the transmission of nociceptive information, that excites the second order nociceptive relay neurons in the dorsal horn. If the serotonin-releasing neurons excite the inhibitory interneurons of the SG, these interneurons in turn inhibit the central processes of the first order neurons."
"Since this inhibition occurs before the impulse reaches the synapse, it is referred to as presynaptic inhibition . Thus these nociceptive incoming impulses are filtered by being suppressed at their first relay station in the spinal cord, by the SG inhibitory interneurons releasing enkephalin or dynorphin. This inhibition occurs because the central processes of these first order neurons possess receptors for enkephalin and dynorphin  in their axolemma."
"There is additional evidence suggesting that there are indeed opioid receptors in the axolemma of the central terminals of the first order nociceptive, substance P-releasing neurons terminating in the SG. This evidence is gathered from reports that naloxone, an opioid antagonist, selectively prevents the blocking of substance P release by the central processes of the first order neurons. Another brainstem region, the dorsolateral pontine reticular formation , is the site of origin of a norepinephrine  analgesic pathway that descends in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord to synapse in the SG ."
"Fibers of this pathway make synaptic contact with inhibitory interneurons of the SG ), thus ultimately leading to the inhibition of the second order projection neurons that reside in lamina V of the dorsal horn of the nociceptive pathway. Unlike the descending opioid analgesic pathways, the effects of the adrenergic  pathway are not blocked by naloxone. Classically, the nociceptive system has been thought of as a sensory system that transmits pain signals from peripheral structures to the spinal cord, brainstem, and higher brain centers."
"Afferent nociceptive input may be modulated at the dorsal horn level, filtering some of the pain signals, preventing them from being transmitted to higher brain centers. Recent studies indicate that not only modulation but also “plastic” alterations may be induced in peripheral nerve terminals, the spinal cord, and the brain in response to a noxious insult. These modifications may enhance the magnitude of nociception and may be a factor in the development of pain that may last only days, or may become persistent and last for months, years, or may become permanent."
"This woman has a primarily sensory disturbance that involves the distal extremities bilaterally. Severe sensory disturbance, even in the absence of motor deficits or cerebellar abnormality, often leads to gait ataxia or incoordination of the hands depending on whether the feet and/or hands are involved. Therefore, the cerebellum is not necessarily involved, but it may be a good idea to check it with imaging."
"The first thing to determine in this case is whether the sensory dysfunction is from pathology in the CNS or the peripheral nervous system  . The PNS can be evaluated by nerve conductions, which reveal how well an electric impulse is conducted by a peripheral nerve. The CNS and the nerve roots can be evaluated by radiologic imaging, particularly MRI."
"In the present case, nerve conductions were essentially normal. Other tests indicate normal nerve roots. These tests indicate that the CNS should be evaluated closely."
"The brisk reflexes in the legs, particularly at the ankles, also indicate peripheral neuropathy is unlikely. MRI of the brain and spinal cord is unrevealing. Laboratory tests to check for a metabolic, or possibly a genetic, cause of pathology to the sensory pathways in the CNS are indicated."
"Laboratory tests indicate that this patient has subacute combined degeneration, secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in enzymatic reactions that are critical for DNA synthesis and neurologic function. Deficiency leads to degeneration of white matter in general, but the posterior columns in the spinal cord tend to be affected early and prominently."
The reason for this predilection is not clear. Motor fibers of the corticospinal tract in the spinal cord are also affected relatively early and can lead to bilateral leg weakness. Dementia from degeneration in the brain and visual disturbance from optic nerve involvement may also occur.
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease of gastric parietal cells that ultimately leads to decreased absorption of vitamin B12 from the small intestine. Treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation is very effective if the disorder is caught early. A 45-year-old man complains of left foot drop which started 5 months ago.
"This was very subtle at first, but has been getting progressively worse. The patient can now barely lift his left foot up. He walks with difficulty."
"More recently he has noticed some clumsiness of his left hand. Upon further questioning he admits to frequent “twitching” of the muscles in his distal lower limbs , forearms, and shoulders. His family thinks he has lost some weight."
"There is no numbness, tingling, pain, or any other neurologic symptom noted. Family history is negative for any neurologic disorder. Examination shows severe weakness and flaccidity of left ankle dorsiflexion and mild weakness of the intrinsic left hand muscles and left finger extension."
"Otherwise, strength seems adequate. There is atrophy noted in the muscles of the left hand and the left pretibial muscles. Fasciculations are noted in several muscle groups of the legs, arms, and back."
Deep tendon reflexes are pathologically brisk in the arms and legs bilaterally. A Babinski response is present bilaterally. The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable.
"Motor activity is controlled by intricate interactions of three major regions of the brain: the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. The cerebral cortex, the ultimate command center of the nervous system, is involved in the planning and execution of complex voluntary motor activities. The basal ganglia function in the initiation of movement, and modulation of the motor cortex."
"The cerebellum receives information from the cerebral cortex, as well as the visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, which it integrates and utilizes to plan, modify, and coordinate movement. This information enables the cerebellum to play a role in the timing, speed, direction, and precision of motor activity. The motor cortex relays information to the cerebellum about impending movement."
"This permits the cerebellum to compare the movement in progress with the movement about to occur. The cerebellum utilizes all of these data to adjust the output of the motor cortex, so that movement is smooth and coordinated. The basal ganglia and the cerebellum exert their influence on the brainstem and spinal cord, and ultimately on motor activity , indirectly by regulating the output of the motor and premotor cortex, via the thalamus."
"In contrast, the primary and secondary motor cortex influence voluntary motor activity via direct projections to the brainstem cranial nerve motor nuclei, the reticular formation, and spinal cord, which in turn send commands to the muscular system . Motor activity is controlled by projections from the primary motor cortex  and the secondary motor cortex  of the frontal lobe to the brainstem and spinal cord . The primary motor cortex  resides in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe ."
"It has an important function in the execution of distinct, well-defined, voluntary motor activity. Each precentral gyrus controls movement of the contralateral side of the body. The body is mapped on the primary motor cortex somatotopically, as an upside down homunculus  ."
"Historically, the homunculus was originally mapped by microstimulation during brain surgery on patients with epilepsy, but in recent years the findings have been confirmed via functional magnetic resonance imaging . The part of the precentral gyrus mediating movement of the toes is located near its superior aspect, whereas the part of the precentral gyrus mediating movement of the tongue, lips, and larynx is located near its inferior aspect . A striking characteristic of the primary motor cortex in humans is that over half of it is associated with the motor activity of the hands, tongue, lips, and larynx, reflecting the manual dexterity and ability for speech that humans possess."
"It also influences the motor control of the axial and girdle musculature, specifically the control of the distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs . In recent years, fMRI studies have provided functional maps of alterations in the oxygen concentration in cerebral vasculature which accompanies neural activity in the brain. Figure 11."
"3  shows the somatotopic organization of the primary motor cortex of eight subjects participating in a study involving the voluntary movement of their fingers, toes, or elbow. The first four subjects  were asked to flex-extend their right fingers, and then their right toes. The second group of four subjects  were asked to flex-extend their right fingers and then their right elbow."
"The fMRI images of the first four subjects show the region of the primary motor cortex that was active during finger and toe movement, whereas the fMRI images of the second group show the region of the primary motor cortex that was active during finger and elbow movement. Nerve cells in the primary motor cortex are organized into groups, each group sending its axons to the cranial nerve motor nuclei, or the reticular formation in the brainstem, or the spinal cord gray matter, where they control the motor activity of a single muscle. The total cortical area that mediates motor activity of a particular body region, is proportional to the complexity of the motor activity produced in that region."
"The secondary motor cortex consists of four regions: the supplementary motor area, the premotor cortex, the frontal eye field, and the posterior parietal motor area . The first three of these motor cortical areas reside in the frontal lobe ; the posterior parietal motor area is located in the parietal lobe. The principal function of the secondary motor cortex is the programing of complex motor activity, which is then relayed to the primary motor cortex, where the execution of motor activity is initiated."
"The primary motor cortex then conveys this input mainly to the brainstem or to the spinal cord. Thus, the majority of nerve signals that are generated in the secondary motor cortex cause complex movements produced by groups of muscles performing a task, unlike the discrete muscle contractions elicited by stimulation of the primary motor cortex. The supplementary motor area  lies in Brodmann’s area 6."
"This area has important functions in the programing phase of the patterns and sequences of elaborate movements, and coordination of movements occurring on the two sides of the body. This cortical area is associated with muscle contractions of the axial  and proximal limb  musculature . The premotor cortex  resides in most of Brodmann’s area 6, on the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe."
"The principal function of this area is the motor control of the axial and proximal limb  musculature. It also functions in guiding or turning the body and the upper limbs toward a desired  direction. Once an intended movement has begun and is in progress, activity in the PMC decreases, reflecting its key function in the planning phase of motor activity."
"The frontal eye field  occupies Brodmann’s area 8. This region is located rostral to the premotor area, on the frontal lobe. The FEF functions in the coordination of eye movements, particularly movements mediating voluntary visual tracking of a moving object."
The posterior parietal motor area  corresponds to Brodmann’s areas 5 and 7. Area 5 is involved in tactile discrimination  and stereognosis . Area 7 is involved with movements that require visual guidance.
"Thus, when one reaches for a glass of cold water, visual guidance  and tactile sensation , both play a role in accomplishing a desired motor task. The cerebral cortex consists of six histologically distinct layers . The internal pyramidal layer , the most conspicuous layer of the motor cortex, contains the somata of the pyramidal cells."
"These cells constitute the main output neurons, which contribute to the cortical descending motor pathways, the corticospinal and corticonuclear  tracts that terminate in the spinal cord and brainstem, respectively. The older term corticobulbar  referred to all of the cortical projections that terminate in the cranial nerve nuclei located in the brainstem. Since not all cranial nerve nuclei are located in the medulla, this older term was replaced with the newer term “corticonuclear” in 1998."
"The corticonuclear tract includes all cortical projections to the cranial nerve nuclei located in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Nerve signals arising from the motor cortex elicit skeletal muscle contractions in various parts of the body. All of the pyramidal cell fibers release glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, that stimulates excitatory or inhibitory interneurons, or less commonly, lower motoneurons, directly."
"There are seven descending motor pathways that ultimately exert their influence on muscle activity . Three of these pathways, the lateral corticospinal, the  anterior corticospinal, and the corticonuclear tracts derive their fibers from the sensorimotor cortex, whereas the other four tracts, the tectospinal, rubrospinal, reticulospinal, and vestibulospinal tracts, derive their fibers from the brainstem. All of the descending tracts terminate in the spinal cord with the exception of the corticonuclear tract, which terminates in the brainstem."
"Approximately two-thirds of the corticospinal tract fibers  originate from the pyramidal cell layer of the frontal cortex; that is, onethird arise from Brodmann’s area 4, and one-third from area 6 . The other third of the corticospinal tract fibers arise from the parietal cortex; specifically from the posterior parietal motor area  and the somatosensory cortex . The pyramidal cells are referred to as the upper motoneurons of the descending motor pathways."
"Their axons descend to synapse in the spinal cord gray matter with: • interneurons, which in turn synapse with motoneurons; • alpha motoneurons, which innervate skeletal muscle fibers; or • gamma motoneurons, which innervate the contractile portion of muscle spindles . Unlike the upper motoneurons, the fibers arising from neurons residing in the somatosensory cortex descend to synapse with second order sensory neurons in the somatic relay nuclei of the ascending sensory pathways . There they influence motor activity by modulating the transmission of sensory information to higher brain centers ."
"Both the cell bodies and axon terminals of the upper motoneurons  and the somatosensory neurons  reside entirely within the central nervous system . As the fibers of the upper motoneurons  and the somatosensory fibers  begin their descent, they traverse the corona radiata and then course through the posterior limb of the internal capsule near its genu . As the fibers continue their descent, they gradually come to occupy the posterior half  of the posterior limb of the internal capsule."
"When they reach the mesencephalon, they are located in the middle third of the crus cerebri . The corticospinal tract continues inferiorly through the brainstem where it disperses into bundles in the basal pons and then reassembles to form a distinct bundle known as the pyramid . Approximately 85–90% of the axons of the corticospinal tract decussate in the caudal medulla, forming the pyramidal decussation ."
"These axons then descend in the lateral funiculus  of the entire length of the spinal cord, as the lateral corticospinal tract, where they terminate primarily in the cervical, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord levels . The remaining 10–15% of the corticospinal tract axons do not decussate but descend ipsilaterally in the anterior funiculus as the smaller, anterior corticospinal tract. Axons of the anterior corticospinal tract terminate mainly in the anterior  horn gray matter of the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord."
"The lateral corticospinal tract contains mostly crossed fibers; however, a small percentage of its fibers are uncrossed. This tract contains among its fibers a group of large-diameter myelinated axons arising from the giant Betz cells residing in the primary motor cortex. Most of the lateral corticospinal tract upper motoneurons projecting to the cervical and lumbosacral spinal cord, end in the lateral intermediate zone gray matter , as well as the anterior  horn gray matter , where they form excitatory synapses with interneurons."
"Both the excitatory and inhibitory interneurons synapse with lower motoneurons. Excitatory interneurons stimulate the lower motoneurons to cause muscle to contract, whereas the inhibitory interneurons inhibit the lower motoneurons . The first order afferent fibers transmitting sensory input from the muscle spindles also establish synaptic contacts with the inhibitory interneurons  in the spinal cord, mediating reflex activity."
"In contrast, a small number of the lateral corticospinal tract upper motoneurons project to the anterior  horns of the spinal cord, where they form excitatory synapses directly with lower motoneurons. Many of these monosynaptic connections are with lower motoneurons innervating muscles of the hand. The giant pyramidal cells, referred to as Betz cells, are located exclusively in the primary motor cortex and contribute approximately 3% of the one million fibers in the corticospinal tract."
"The large-diameter  axons of most of the Betz cells descend to synapse only in the lumbar and sacral levels of the spinal cord. Due to their large, myelinated axons, the Betz cells are capable of the fastest nerve impulse transmission to the spinal cord. The remaining  of the corticospinal fibers consist of small-diameter , slower impulse-conducting fibers."
"The Betz cell fibers descend to terminate in the lumbar and sacral spinal cord levels where they synapse directly with the lower motoneurons that innervate the musculature of the lower limb. These monosynaptic connections of Betz cells with the lower motoneurons innervating the muscles of the lower limb are actually fewer in number than the monosynaptic connections to lower motoneurons innervating the hand. Although the lateral corticospinal tract contains mostly crossed fibers, it also contains a minor group of fibers , that do not cross at the pyramidal decussation, but instead descend ipsilaterally."
"Thus, the lateral corticospinal tract contains both crossed and uncrossed fibers. At their termination, the uncrossed fibers synapse with the spinal cord interneurons mediating movement of the axial  and proximal limb  musculature. The uncrossed fibers are associated with the maintenance of upright posture and general orientation of the limbs."
"The lateral corticospinal tract mediates the execution of rapid, skilled, voluntary movements of the distal musculature of the upper and lower limbs . The upper motoneurons of the anterior corticospinal tract do not decussate in the caudal medulla. Instead, they descend in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord to terminate mainly in the anterior horn gray matter of the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord levels."
"Near their termination, these fibers decussate to the opposite side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure to synapse with interneurons that in turn synapse with lower motoneurons. Other fibers of the anterior corticospinal tract decussate to the opposite side near their termination and instead synapse directly with lower motoneurons, innervating the axial musculature  as well as the proximal upper limb  musculature. Approximately 55% of all of the corticospinal fibers terminate at cervical levels of the spinal cord, 20% terminate at thoracic levels, and the remaining 25% terminate at lumbar and sacral levels of the spinal cord ."
"The large number of corticospinal fibers terminating at cervical spinal cord levels is an indication of the extensive influence they exert on neurons affecting the motor activity of the upper limb musculature, especially that of the hand. Corticospinal fibers arising from the somatosensory cortex terminate in the dorsal  horn of the spinal cord, where they synapse with second order afferent sensory neurons to modulate sensory input . The corticospinal fibers influencing motor activity arise from the motor cortical areas and terminate primarily in the intermediate zone and ventral horn gray matter of the spinal cord, where they synapse with interneurons ; whereas a small number of the corticospinal fibers terminate in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, where they synapse directly with lower motoneurons."
"The anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts decrease in size at successively lower spinal cord levels, as more and more of their fibers reach their terminations. The cell bodies of the lower motoneurons serving the axial  and the upper and lower limb musculature, reside in the anterior  horns of the spinal cord. More specifically, the cell bodies of the lower motoneurons serving the trunk muscles occupy the medial aspect of the ventral horns, whereas the cell bodies of the lower motoneurons serving the upper and lower limbs reside in the lateral aspect of the ventral horns ."
"The fibers of the lower motoneurons collect to emerge from the spinal cord as the motor roots of spinal nerves that are a component of the peripheral nervous system. Although the fibers of the corticospinal tracts terminate principally in the spinal cord, they distribute collaterals to widespread regions of the nervous system in their descent. Collaterals terminate in the ventral nuclei of the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the reticular formation, the red nucleus, the pontine nuclei, the posterior column nuclei, the posterior  horn of the spinal cord, and the intermediolateral  cell column  of the spinal cord."
"Thus, the corticospinal tract probably has more than one function at various levels of the neuronal axis. The primary somatosensory area, located in the postcentral gyrus , also projects fibers involved in motor activity to the brainstem and spinal cord. The somatosensory fibers join the upper motoneuron fibers arising from the motor cortex, and accompany them in their descent as the corticospinal tracts, to terminate primarily in the somatic sensory relay nuclei of the brainstem and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord."
"The descending somatosensory fibers, however, do not synapse at their termination, with interneurons or motoneurons receiving synapses from the upper motoneurons. Instead, they synapse with the second order sensory neurons in the somatic sensory relay nuclei of the sensory ascending pathways , and the sensory nuclei in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Their function there is to influence motor activity by modulating the sensory information that is relayed to the brainstem and spinal cord from peripheral structures; thus they are not considered to be upper motoneurons."
"Alpha motoneurons innervate the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle, whereas gamma motoneurons innervate the intrafusal fibers  that are special stretch receptors dispersed among the extrafusal fibers of a muscle. During a normal movement, both the alpha and gamma motoneurons are co-activated. If only the alpha motoneurons innervating a muscle were stimulated, only the extrafusal fibers of the muscle would contract, causing the overall muscle to shorten."
"Although the intrafusal fibers would passively shorten , their central noncontractile portion would become slack and be unable to monitor changes in muscle length. Muscle spindles maintain their sensitivity to muscle length, even when the muscle is contracting to a shorter length, via a mechanism known as alpha-gamma co-activation. As the alpha motoneurons stimulate the extrafusal muscle fibers to contract, simultaneously the gamma motoneurons stimulate the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers to contract."
"This maintains tension on the central  region of the intrafusal fibers where the sensory endings are located. This alpha-gamma co-activation is necessary to maintain the “stretch sensitivity” of the intrafusal fibers, so that they are ready to detect the slightest stretch at any length  of the muscle. The corticonuclear tract  consists of fibers derived from the primary motor cortex , the premotor cortex , and the somesthetic cortex ."
"The corticonuclear tract, consisting of fibers of upper motoneurons, accompanies the corticospinal tract. The two tracts descend in tandem, traversing the corona radiata and the internal capsule to reach the crus cerebri  of the midbrain. The corticonuclear tract descends in the internal capsule, but anterior to the corticospinal fibers."
"The corticonuclear fibers diverge from the corticospinal fibers at various brainstem levels to terminate in their target cranial nerve somatic motor or branchiomotor nuclei. Similar to the fibers of the corticospinal tracts, some of the corticonuclear fibers synapse directly with motoneurons, but the majority of fibers synapse with interneurons housed within the nucleus of termination or with local interneurons of the brainstem reticular formation. The interneurons in turn synapse with the motoneurons of the cranial nerve motor  nuclei."
"The corticonuclear fibers not only terminate in the cranial nerve motor nuclei, but also in the sensory relay nuclei  and the brainstem reticular formation. The corticonuclear fibers affect the motor nuclei of the following cranial nerves: the oculomotor , trochlear , trigeminal , abducent , facial , glossopharyngeal , vagus , spinal accessory , and hypoglossal . In general, most cranial nerve motor nuclei receive bilateral projections from the corticonuclear tracts."
"The corticonuclear tract fibers do not project to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei directly. Fibers derived from the frontal eye field  course in the corticonuclear tracts, to terminate in the mesencephalon, specifically in the superior colliculus, the pretectal nuclei, and the accessory oculomotor nuclei. These nuclei then relay inputs to the motor nuclei of the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nerves that control eye movements."
"The remaining corticonuclear fibers continue their descent to the pontine and medullary levels , where most of them terminate in the reticular formation to synapse with interneurons . A number of corticonuclear fibers terminate directly and bilaterally in the motor nuclei of the trigeminal and facial nerves. At the upper pontine levels, some of the fibers diverge from the corticonuclear tract, course into the pontine tegmentum, and terminate bilaterally in the pontine reticular formation and the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve."
"The corticonuclear fibers project contralaterally to the lower motoneurons that supply motor innervation to the lateral pterygoid muscle, and bilaterally to the lower motoneurons that innervate the remaining muscles of mastication. At the midpontine level some of the corticonuclear fibers terminate bilaterally in the facial nucleus, which innervates the muscles of facial expression, the platysma, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and the stylohyoid and stapedius muscles. The corticonuclear tract projects bilaterally to the lower motoneurons of the facial nucleus that innervate the muscles of the upper half of the face, whereas this same tract projects only contralaterally to the lower motoneurons of the facial nucleus that innervate the muscles of the lower half of the face ."
"The remaining corticonuclear fibers terminate in the nucleus ambiguus at caudal pontine levels, the accessory nucleus at midmedullary levels, and the hypoglossal nuclei at caudal medullary levels. At the caudal pontine levels and rostral medullary levels, some corticonuclear fibers diverge from the tract to terminate in the nucleus ambiguus, a motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves. These three cranial nerves supply motor innervation to the skeletal muscles of the palate, pharynx, and larynx."
"The nucleus ambiguus receives bilateral corticonuclear tract projections. A small bundle of corticonuclear fibers, Pick’s bundle, proceeds inferiorly along with the corticospinal tract to the level of the pyramidal decussation where they cross, then recur and ascend to terminate in the nucleus ambiguus of the opposite side. At midmedullary levels, some corticonuclear fibers diverge from the corticonuclear tract to terminate primarily in the ipsilateral accessory nucleus of the spinal accessory nerve that innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles."
"The remaining corticonuclear fibers terminate in the hypoglossal nuclei that house the lower motoneurons that innervate the tongue musculature. The corticonuclear fibers project contralaterally on the lower motoneurons that innervate the genioglossus muscle, whereas the remaining lower motoneurons that innervate all other tongue musculature receive bilateral projections . The visual association areas  give rise to the fibers of the corticotectal tract that descend to terminate in the oculomotor accessory nuclei  and the deep layers of the superior colliculus."
"The neurons of the oculomotor accessory nuclei give rise to fibers that join the medial longitudinal fasciculus to terminate in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei, where they influence vertical, rotatory, and smooth pursuit eye movements. The superior colliculus gives rise to the fibers of the tectospinal tract , which decussates at the level of the red nucleus in the midbrain, and then descends to the medulla, in the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The tectospinal fibers continue their descent in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord to end at cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord levels where they synapse with interneurons."
"The tectospinal tract is involved in the mediation of reflex movements of the eyes, and in the cervical and thoracic region of the trunk elicited by visual, auditory, and vestibular stimuli. The corticorubral tract arises from the sensorimotor cortex  and terminates in the ipsilateral red nucleus in the mesencephalon . The cell bodies in the caudal part of the red nucleus give rise to fibers forming the larger rubrobulbar tract and the smaller rubrospinal tract ."
"Both of these tracts decussate in the anterior midbrain tegmentum. As the rubrobulbar tract descends, some of its fibers terminate in the principal  sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, as well as the subnucleus oralis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. As other rubrobulbar fibers continue their descent in the brainstem, they terminate in the facial nucleus where they establish synapses with lower motoneurons innervating the muscles of the upper half of the face."
"Still other rubrobulbar fibers terminate in the lateral reticular nucleus, as well as the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus in the medulla. The fibers that terminate in the nucleus gracilis and cuneatus modulate the transmission of afferent sensory information to the spinal cord via presynaptic inhibition. The rubrospinal tract on the other hand, descends in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord."
"Its fibers terminate in the lateral intermediate zone and anterior horn of the spinal cord where they synapse with interneurons. The red nucleus facilitates the alpha, beta, and gamma motoneurons that innervate the contralateral upper limb flexor muscles, whereas it simultaneously inhibits those of the extensors, specifically the nerve cells that innervate the distal muscles of the upper limbs. This facilitation and inhibition is mediated by the rubrospinal tract terminating in the spinal cord, and by the rubrobulbar tract which terminates in the flexor region of the medullary reticular formation."
"The rubrospinal tract  functions in controlling the movement of the hand and digits, by facilitating flexor muscle tone and inhibiting the extensor musculature of the upper limb. The sensorimotor cortex sends bilateral projections via the corticoreticular fibers which course with the corticonuclear and the corticospinal tracts to several nuclei dispersed in the brainstem  reticular formation. The reticular nuclei also receive an input from the cerebellum, the vestibular nuclei, and nociceptive fibers from the spinal cord."
"Neurons in the pontine reticular nuclei  give rise to fibers that form the medial  reticulospinal tract, which descends ipsilaterally in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord. These fibers terminate and synapse with spinal cord interneurons and gamma motoneurons at all levels of the spinal cord. The pontine reticular fibers stimulate extensor muscle and inhibit flexor muscle movements ."
"The lateral  reticulospinal tract arises from the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis and descends bilaterally in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. Nerve fibers terminate at all spinal cord levels, where they synapse mainly with interneurons in the intermediate zone gray matter of the spinal cord. The medullary reticular fibers have an inhibitory effect on extensors and an excitatory affect on flexors."
"The lateral reticulospinal tract also relays an autonomic input to the sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons of the spinal cord, which mediate autonomic functions such as pupillary dilation, heart rate modulation, and sweating . These two tracts influence the motor control of axial  and proximal limb musculature and are involved in posture maintenance and orientation of the limbs in an intended direction. The vestibular nuclei receive sensory input related to head movement from the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear via the vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve  and to balance from the cerebellum."
"The lateral vestibulospinal tract arises from the lateral vestibular nucleus . This tract contains ipsilateral fibers that descend in the anterior funiculus to end at all spinal cord levels, to synapse mainly with excitatory interneurons. These interneurons stimulate motoneurons that innervate axial  and proximal limb extensor muscles, and simultaneously inhibit lower motoneurons that innervate limb flexor muscles."
This tract is involved in the maintenance of posture and balance by specifically facilitating motoneurons that innervate the antigravity muscles . This tract also mediates head and neck movements in response to vestibular sensory input. The medial vestibulospinal tract arises from the medial vestibular nucleus .
"This tract descends mostly ipsilaterally in the medial longitudinal fasciculus of the brainstem, and then in the anterior funiculus of the cervical and upper half of the thoracic spinal cord. Its fibers synapse with interneurons that synapse with alpha and gamma motoneurons. Some fibers terminate on alpha motoneurons directly."
"These fibers exert their influence on neurons of the cervical spinal cord , and mediating head movement while maintaining gaze fixation on an object. The descending motor pathways are classified into three functional categories: the ventromedial  group, the lateral group, and the cortical group. In general, the fibers of each of these functional groups synapse in the gray matter that is in close proximity to their position in the white matter."
"That is, the fibers of the ventromedial group synapse in the medial aspect and intermediate zone of the spinal cord gray matter, whereas the fibers of the lateral group synapse in the lateral aspect and intermediate zone of the spinal cord gray matter. Furthermore, the lower motoneurons that innervate the flexor muscles occupy a region of gray matter that is posterior to the lower motoneurons innervating the extensor muscles . The ventromedial group consists of the anterior corticospinal tract, the medial and lateral vestibulospinal tracts, the medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts, and the tectospinal tract, which are all located in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord and synapse in the medial aspect of the anterior horn and intermediate zone ."
"These pathways project bilaterally, controlling the axial and proximal limb musculature of both sides. These tracts function in the bilateral control of gross movements of the axial and proximal limb musculature for balance maintenance and during postural adjustments. The lateral group consists of the lateral corticospinal and the rubrospinal tracts, located mostly in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord."
"The fibers of these two tracts synapse in the lateral aspect and intermediate zone of the ventral horn of the spinal cord . The rubrospinal tract extends only to the first cervical level of the spinal cord and does not have a very important function in humans. These tracts  function in the control of, in particular, the distal but also of the proximal musculature of the upper and lower limbs, as well as mediating independent digit movements."
"The cortical group consists of lateral corticospinal tract fibers that synapse directly with lower motoneurons, particularly the neurons whose fibers innervate the distal muscles of the limbs, such as the intrinsic muscles of the hand. This tract is involved in independent, fractionated movements of the digits. The lower motoneurons are referred to as the final common pathway because they are influenced by the corticospinal, tectospinal, rubrospinal, reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, and reflex neurons."
"All input is ultimately funneled to the lower motoneurons that innervate the skeletal muscles directly. Since the corticospinal tract projects from the cerebral cortex through the corona radiata, the internal capsule, the cerebral peduncle, the pons, the medulla, and the entire spinal cord, it is vulnerable to lesions from various sources throughout its path. The most common corticospinal tract lesion results from a cerebral vascular accident ."
"A stroke can result either from a vascular hemorrhage or a vascular occlusion resulting from a thrombus . The middle cerebral artery is buried in the lateral fissure separating the parietal from the temporal lobe, and gives rise to branches that supply structures in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Many of its branches perforate the cerebral hemisphere to reach deep subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia and the internal capsule."
"A cerebral vascular accident affecting the internal capsule is referred to as a capsular stroke. Since both the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts course in the internal capsule, a capsular stroke can result in considerable upper motoneuron damage, referred to as an upper motoneuron  lesion. The most prominent physical deficit resulting from damage of the corticospinal tract fibers is a contralateral hemiplegia  of the upper and lower limbs and extensor plantar response ."
"Normally, when the plantar surface of the foot is stimulated, the foot reflexly plantarflexes  mediated by the corticospinal tract. In an individual with a corticospinal tract lesion, however, stimulation of the plantar surface of the foot elicits hyperextension of the foot accompanied by dorsiflexion of the great toe and by a fanning of the remaining toes . In the absence of the corticospinal tract, this pathologic response is mediated by the descending motor pathways arising from the brainstem."
"An upper motoneuron lesion also results in spasticity in the affected limb. Spasticity results following damage to neurons of the primary motor cortex and neurons of the secondary motor cortex. If the corticonuclear tract fibers are damaged, the individual will exhibit a weakness of the contralateral lower face, and the tongue will deviate toward the impaired side when the patient attempts to protude it."
"There is weakness of the contralateral lower face because the lower half of the facial motor nucleus receives only contralateral projections from the motor cortex, whereas the upper half of the facial motor nucleus receives bilateral projections from the motor cortex. An individual who has a unilateral lesion confined to the primary motor cortex , will at first experience a contralateral flaccid paralysis in the affected muscles on the contralateral side of the body. After about 2 weeks, the individual will recover function in the affected proximal limb  muscles; however, the paralysis will persist in the distal muscles of the limbs."
"This type of lesion will affect mainly the fine movements of the contralateral distal limbs, particularly those of the hand. Although there is recovery of some of the motor functions of the limbs, the individual will not have the fractionated, independent control of the distal muscles of the limbs. When attempting to flex a single finger, all fingers flex concurrently."
"A lesion confined to the primary motor cortex will not cause a total motor deficit since the tectospinal, reticulospinal, and vestibulospinal tracts and upper motoneurons from the secondary motor cortex will supply motor input to the interneurons and lower motoneurons. Lesions confined to the primary motor cortex are rare. If the lesion also involves Brodmann’s area 6, the paralysis will persist and spasticity will appear in the distal limb muscles."
"A lesion confined to the supplementary motor area will result in the inability to coordinate hand movements bilaterally. The individual can execute the same motor activity with both hands ; however, when attempting to simultaneously execute a different motor activity with each hand, it may seem complicated and impossible to accomplish. A lesion confined to the premotor cortex typically does not cause paralysis."
"Instead, an individual with a lesion in the premotor cortex will have difficulty executing voluntary movements with the involved body part, contralateral to the side of the lesion. If the upper limb is affected, the individual will have difficulty in picking up a glass of water or using a fork, in the absence of perceptible changes in muscle tone, spasticity, or paralysis. A lower motoneuron  lesion is a lesion involving:  the cell bodies of the lower motoneurons residing in the cranial nerve motor nuclei or the ventral horn of the spinal cord; or  the axons of the lower motoneurons coursing in a cranial nerve or other peripheral nerve."
"A LMN lesion results in flaccid paralysis and severe atrophy and fasciculations in the denervated muscle. Both the history and the clinical exam are very important for the diagnosis in this case. This patient has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , commonly known in the USA as Lou Gehrig’s disease."
This is a neurodegenerative disease affecting only the motor system. Sensory and cognitive functions remain intact throughout the disease. ALS characteristically leads to death of both the upper motoneurons in the motor cortex and also the lower motoneurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord.
"It is the most common of the motoneuron diseases—diseases which affect, specifically, the upper and/or lower motoneurons. The combination of the signs and symptoms of ALS is usually unmistakable. Upper motoneuron loss produces pathologically brisk reflexes, Babinski reflexes , and sometimes spasticity or “stiffness” of an extremity."
"Lower motoneuron loss leads to flaccid weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Both types of lesions can cause weakness. Head imaging is typically normal."
"Electromyography will confirm or refute the presence of motor neuron disease . This is an electrical test of muscle fiber physiology, and gives information about the integrity of the motor unit . ALS is a devastating disease."
"It is more common in older age groups, but the average person affected by it is middle aged or a bit older. This disease leads to relentless progression of muscle weakness, causing the individual to become wheelchair-bound and eventually incapacitated. Distal muscles in one arm or leg, or bulbar muscles  are affected first."
"Any muscle group can be a target, and eventually the muscles of breathing become affected. Death from respiratory failure or another intervening illness, such as pneumonia, typically occurs a few or several years from initial diagnosis. The vast majority of cases of ALS are sporadic."
"A small percentage of cases are hereditary. The pathophysiology is unknown and there is no effective treatment. A 39-year-old man has had abnormal and uncontrollable movements for the past 6 months, as well as forgetfulness, obsessions, and compulsions."
"His wife notes some mild personality changes as well. He has become somewhat more irritable and withdrawn. These movements are spontaneous, unpredictable, and have become almost continuous."
Initially his wife thought he had become “fidgety. ” Abnormal behaviors as well as the extraneous movements have caused some social embarrassment. The patient’s mother died in her fifties at a psychiatric hospital.
"He has no more information about her. Family history is otherwise unrevealing. Examination shows obvious chorea consisting of involuntary, nonrhythmic, and persistent jerky movements of the head, neck, and arms that continue during conversation."
Memory is mildly diminished. He seems very distractible and has difficulty completing motor tasks. Neurologic exam is otherwise unremarkable.
"MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the heads of both caudate nuclei. Normal motor function is the result of the intricate interaction of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia initiate motor activity and modulate cortical output related to motor function."
"The cerebellum functions in the coordination of movement, whereas the cerebral cortex is involved in the planning and execution of voluntary movement. The basal ganglia and cerebellum exert their influence on the brainstem and spinal cord, and ultimately on motor activity indirectly, by regulating the output of the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. The cerebral cortex then influences the execution of motor activity via direct projections to the brainstem nuclei  and spinal cord motoneurons."
"The function of the basal ganglia is influenced by input arising not only from primary sensory and sensory association areas of the cerebral cortex of all four lobes, but also from the thalamus and brainstem. All four lobes of the cerebrum, the thalamus, and the brainstem project to the input nuclei of the basal ganglia, mainly to the caudate nucleus and putamen. These input nuclei then project to the globus pallidus, which in turn relays basal ganglial output via the thalamus to the motor and other areas of the frontal cortex ."
"Although more is known about the role of the basal ganglia in motor functions, numerous studies support the finding that they also have other, nonmotor functions as well. Disturbances of the neural connections of the basal ganglia result not only in movement disorders, but also considerable deficits in other, nonmotor functions including cognition, perception, and emotional behaviors. Ultimately, outflow from the basal ganglia reaching the cerebral cortex has an impact not only on motor activity, but also on other functions as diverse as sensorimotor integration, and cognitive and emotional behaviors."
"The term basal ganglia is a misnomer since these structures consist of an assortment of subcortical nuclei, rather than ganglia. The criterion used by early neuroanatomists for the classification of the basal ganglia was any structure composed of gray matter that is embedded deep within, and close to the basal aspect of, the cerebral hemispheres. Thus, previously, the components of the basal ganglia included the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, amygdala, and claustrum."
"In more recent years, however, neuroanatomists include in the basal ganglia only those deep nuclei of the cerebrum which, when damaged, produce movement disorders. From a clinical perspective, the components of the basal ganglia involved in motor function are the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus , as well as another nucleus, the substantia nigra, which is really located in the midbrain, but is functionally related to the basal ganglia. The caudate nucleus and the putamen share an embryologic derivation as well as similar morphological characteristics."
"Hence they are considered to be a single anatomical structure and are collectively referred to as the striatum  . The ventral portions of the head of the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the anterior perforated substance, and the nucleus accumbens together are referred to as the ventral striatum. Anatomically, the striatum  and the globus pallidus  collectively form the corpus striatum."
"The putamen is the most massive nucleus of the corpus striatum. The ventral component of the globus pallidus is the ventral pallidum. In addition to the components mentioned so far, the following structures are functionally related to the basal ganglia: the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, mediodorsal, and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and the amygdala of the limbic system ."
"In this chapter, the basal ganglia consist of the caudate nucleus, the lenticular nucleus with its two components , and the nucleus accumbens; and, since the subthalamic nucleus of the ventral thalamus and the substantia nigra of the mesencephalon are functionally connected to the corpus striatum, and produce movement disorders when damaged, they are also included. The thalamus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala do not produce movement disorders when damaged. It is important to note that the thalamus does not only serve as a relay nucleus for sensory information to the somatosensory cortex, but also as a relay nucleus for motor information that arises from the basal ganglia and the cerebellum that is destined for the motor cortex."
". Its dilated, somewhat bulbous, rostral end is referred to as the head of the caudate nucleus. It is located in the lateral wall of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle and is continuous ventrally with the putamen ."
"Near the interventricular foramen, the head is continuous with the long, curved body of the caudate nucleus, which courses posteriorly and lies on the floor of the lateral ventricle. Near the posterior end of the thalamus, the body decreases in diameter and continues as the long, narrow tail of the caudate nucleus. The tail gradually bends ventrally and then anteriorly within the lateral ventricle passing along the roof of its inferior horn and extending into the temporal lobe as far anteriorly as the amygdaloid nucleus."
The internal capsule separates the caudate nucleus from the lenticular nucleus. The biconvex lenticular nucleus is located between the insula and the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. It is separated from the caudate nucleus by the anterior limb of the internal capsule and from the thalamus by the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
"The lenticular nucleus is divided by myelinated fibers, the lateral  medullary lamina, into its two component parts: the laterally positioned, convex putamen and the medially placed globus pallidus . The globus pallidus  is wedge-shaped on coronal and horizontal sections. Due to its many myelinated fibers it appears paler in fresh specimens than the putamen."
"A group of myelinated fibers, the medial  medullary lamina, divides the globus pallidus into a medial  segment  and a lateral  segment . The GPm is embryologically related to the diencephalon and the subthalamus , and gives rise to the major output from the basal ganglia. Although, as indicated above, the lenticular nucleus and the caudate nucleus are separated by the internal capsule, the rostral extent of the putamen is connected to the head of the caudate nucleus by bridge-like extensions of gray matter."
"During early developmental stages, the growing axons of the internal capsule perforated the gray matter of the fused caudate nucleus and putamen . These extensions form a distinct ventral portion of the striatum, the ventral striatum, which via its connections is associated with the limbic system. The intervals between these extensions are traversed by the somewhat vertically oriented, slender but prominent fiber bundles of the anterior limb of the internal capsule ."
"Thus, in fresh brain sections, the region between the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus exhibits alternating stripes of gray matter and white matter. It was named the corpus striatum  based on this striping pattern. The nucleus accumbens is a component of the striatum."
"It resides ventral to the anterior limb of the internal capsule and is connected to the caudate nucleus and the putamen. It receives input information from the limbic system and is involved in the processing of the emotional aspects of movement . The subthalamic nucleus, a component of the subthalamus, is an oval-shaped, biconvex mass of gray matter that lies lateral to the hypothalamus on the medial aspect of the internal capsule ."
"Its function is not known. The substantia nigra  extends from the rostral end to the caudal end of the mesencephalon dorsal to the cerebral peduncle. It is composed of two distinct parts: a ventral, cell-sparse, reticular part, the pars reticulata  and a dorsal, cellular, compact part, the pars compacta ."
"The cell-sparse pars reticulata consists of:  neuron terminals arising from the midbrain raphe nuclei, which release serotonin; and  striatonigral nerve terminals, which release gamma aminobutyric acid . Although the pars reticulata contains numerous nerve terminals, it is a nuclear structure and also contains nerve cell bodies. The pars reticulata is continuous with, and shares many histologic characteristics with, the medial segment of the globus pallidus."
"Furthermore, similar to the globus pallidus, this portion of the substantia nigra receives projections from the striatum and sends its GABAergic neurons to the thalamus. Both the medial segment of the globus pallidus, and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, give rise to the output of the basal ganglia; due to their similarities and continuity they are considered to be the same structure. The cellular pars compacta consists of pigmented dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin."
"These neurons give rise to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway that projects to the striatum. More over, the dendritic extensions of these dopaminergic neurons extend into the pars reticulata. The ventral anterior and the ventral lateral nuclei of the dorsal thalamus  relay movement-related signals from the basal ganglia to the frontal cortex."
"The medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus relays signals from the basal ganglia to frontal cortex association areas as well as to limbic areas. These areas play a role in cognitive functions and the processing of emotions, respectively. The centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, two of the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus representing the rostral extent of the ascending reticular activating system , receive inputs from the spinothalamic, trigeminothalamic, and multisynaptic ascending pathways  relaying pain sensation."
"These nuclei relay this information to the somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex and the caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum . Based on these connections, these nuclei are believed to function in sensorimotor integration. In addition, as a result of their diffuse cortical connections, they are believed to be involved in the maintenance of arousal of the organism as it relates to pain."
"The amygdaloid nucleus is located in the temporal lobe, deep to the uncus. Although the amygdaloid nucleus is related to the basal ganglia via neural connections, it is anatomically and functionally part of the limbic system . The claustrum consists of a slender layer of gray matter, which is separated medially from the convex surface of the putamen by the external capsule, and laterally from the insula by a thin layer of white matter, the extreme capsule."
"Connections to the basal ganglia have not been established, and its function is as yet unknown . The basal ganglia are intricately and extensively interconnected with various regions of the central nervous system . Viewed from the perspective of their connections, the component nuclei of the basal ganglia may be assigned into three categories: input nuclei, intrinsic nuclei, and output nuclei ."
"The caudate nucleus, putamen, and the nucleus accumbens are the input nuclei of the basal ganglia. They receive a prominent excitatory input from all four lobes of the cerebral cortex as well as from the thalamus, subthalamus, substantia nigra, and other brainstem structures. Most of the input terminates in the caudate nucleus and the putamen."
"These input nuclei then relay the information to the intrinsic and output nuclei. The caudate nucleus and the putamen function in the initiation and modulation of gross voluntary movements that are performed at the subconscious level, whereas the nucleus accumbens is associated with the processing of the emotional aspects of movement. The intrinsic nuclei consist of the lateral segment of the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra."
"These nuclei are not only interconnected by their local circuit projections, but are also connected with the input and output nuclei. Although the subthalamic nucleus is a source of excitatory signals, most local synapses are inhibitory. Both the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus function in the control of the axial and girdle  musculature."
"The responsibility of these nuclei is to position and stabilize the trunk and proximal parts of the upper and lower limbs, so that the distal limb musculature moving the hands and feet are able to perform the more discreet movements that are controlled by the motor cortex. This concept is consistent with the observation that neural activity in the globus pallidus precedes that of the motor cortex. The output nuclei consist of the medial segment of the globus pallidus, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, and the ventral pallidum."
"Output from the basal ganglia is inhibitory , passing from the medial segment of the globus pallidus and from the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra mainly to the thalamus, via the pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic fibers, respectively. However, fibers from these nuclei also project to the subthalamic nuclei, the brainstem, and the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia exert their influence on motor activity indirectly by controlling the premotor and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex, and not by direct projections to the brainstem and spinal cord motoneurons."
"Note that although all four lobes of the cerebral cortex project to the basal ganglia, output from the basal ganglia terminates exclusively in the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. The basal ganglia have the following characteristics: • they receive input fibers from various sources outside the basal ganglia; • they are interconnected by local  fiber projections; and • they project output fibers to other areas of the brain that are involved in motor function. The caudate nucleus and the putamen are the principal input nuclei of the basal ganglia."
"The caudate nucleus is associated primarily with cognitive functions and less with motor activity, whereas the putamen is associated primarily with motor functions. The caudate nucleus and putamen receive the following afferent  fibers : • corticostriate fibers; • thalamostriate fibers; • nigrostriate fibers; • fibers from the ventral tegmental area; and • fibers from the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus . The corticostriate fibers arise from widespread areas of the cerebral cortex , mainly from its motor and somatosensory areas."
"Each cortical part projects fibers that descend in the internal or external capsules to the caudate nucleus and the putamen, and they release the excitatory neurotransmitters glutamate or aspartate at their termination. Fibers arising from the primary sensory , primary motor , premotor , and supplementary motor  cortex terminate principally in the putamen. Fibers arising from the frontal eye fields  and association areas of the cortex terminate principally in the caudate nucleus."
"Moreover, some corticostriate fibers arising from the motor and premotor cortices terminate in the subthalamic nucleus of the striatum. The intralaminar  nuclei of the thalamus are the cranial continuation of the midbrain reticular formation into the diencephalon and are components of the reticular activating system . These nuclei receive nociceptive signals via reticulothalamic fibers  and, as components of the RAS, function in alerting the individual and to elicit responses that will enable it to evade painful stimuli."
"The thalamostriate fibers are excitatory, they terminate mainly in the putamen and the caudate nucleus, and they release glutamate. In addition, the striatum also receives input fibers from the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus. The function of these latter projections is not yet known."
"The nigrostriate fibers arise from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and terminate primarily in the caudate nucleus, although some fibers terminate in the putamen. These predominantly uncrossed fibers are inhibitory or excitatory and release dopamine at their termination. The fibers from the ventral tegmental area terminate primarily in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, and the cerebral cortex."
"These projections function in the initiation of behavioral responses. The fibers arising from the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus terminate in the caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, and subthalamic nucleus. These inhibitory fibers release serotonin at their termination."
"The pedunculopontine nucleus may function in the rhythm of movements. Although the caudate nucleus and putamen receive inputs from multiple sources such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, their output fibers are funneled only to the pallidum and substantia nigra. The caudate nucleus and the putamen give rise to the following efferent  fibers : • striatopallidal fibers; and • striatonigral fibers."
"The striatopallidal fibers that terminate in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus liberate GABA and enkephalin, whereas those fibers that terminate in the medial segment of the globus pallidus release GABA and substance P. The striatonigral fibers terminate in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. These fibers release GABA, acetylcholine, or substance P."
"The medial and lateral segments of the globus pallidus receive inputs from the same regions but their output projections differ. As discussed above, the striatopallidal fibers arising from the caudate nucleus and the putamen release GABA and enkephalin or GABA and substance P, and form the principal input to the globus pallidus. The subthalamopallidal fibers arise from the subthalamic nucleus, form the subthalamic fasciculus, and terminate mainly in the medial segment of the globus pallidus."
"These excitatory fibers release glutamate at their termination. Even though the medial and lateral segments of the globus pallidus share both morphological and neurochemical characteristics, each gives rise to well-defined output fibers . The lateral segment of the globus pallidus gives rise to: • pallidosubthalamic fibers; • pallidonigral fibers; and • other fiber projections that terminate in the striatum, reticular thalamic nucleus, and the medial segment of the globus pallidus ."
"The pallidosubthalamic fibers arise only from the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. They join the subthalamic fasciculus, which terminates in the subthalamic nucleus and sends collateral branches to the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. These fibers are inhibitory, and release GABA at their terminals."
"The pallidonigral fibers are inhibitory and release GABA at their termination. In addition, the lateral segment of the globus pallidus also relays signals to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, which assists in the integration of reciprocal connections between the thalamus and the cortex. The medial segment of the globus pallidus gives rise to: • pallidothalamic fibers whose two components are the ansa lenticularis and the lenticular fasciculus ; • pallidotegmental fibers; and • pallidohabenular fibers ."
"The medial segment of the globus pallidus is the main output station of the corpus striatum. The ventral part of the medial segment of the globus pallidus gives rise to a group of the pallidothalamic fibers that course ventromedially, and then rostrally, to form a loop, the ansa lenticularis, on the medial aspect of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The ansa lenticularis then courses posteriorly, in the prerubral field ."
"The dorsal part of the medial segment of the globus pallidus gives rise to another group of pallidothalamic fibers that course medially, traversing the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Medial to the subthalamus, these fibers assemble to form the lenticular fasciculus . The pallidothalamic fibers coursing in the lenticular fasciculus subsequently join the pallidothalamic fibers of the ansa lenticularis, to form a prominent fiber bundle known as the H1 field of Forel."
"This bundle proceeds medially and caudally to the prerubral field  rostral to the red nucleus. The fibers then form a loop and course to the thalamus collectively as the thalamic fasciculus . The thalamic fasciculus terminates in the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, medial dorsal, centromedian, and parafascicular nuclei of the thalamus."
"The thalamus in turn projects to the primary motor cortex as well as to the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex of the secondary motor cortex, all of which contribute fibers to the corticonuclear, corticospinal, and corticopontocerebellar tracts. The signals arising from the basal ganglia that are relayed to the spinal cord via the contralateral lateral corticospinal tracts are involved in limb movements. Recall that the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus are considered to be the “thalamic motor nuclei” since they receive signals related to motor function and send signals to the motor areas of the cortex."
"Note that the output fibers arising from the basal ganglia and the fibers arising from the cerebellum that are destined for the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus, do not overlap at their terminations. They terminate in distinct areas of these thalamic nuclei. The pallidotegmental fibers arise from the medial segment of the globus pallidus and terminate in the PPN in the inferior tegmentum of the mesencephalon."
"The PPN, a nucleus of the reticular formation, is associated with the reticulospinal tract cells, which terminate on lower motoneurons and affect motor function. The pallidohabenular fibers arise from the medial segment of the globus pallidus, course in the ansa lenticularis and  lenticular fasciculus in the H field of Forel, and then join the stria medullaris to terminate in the lateral habenular nucleus. The habenular nucleus, a component of the habenular nuclear complex of the epithalamus, is associated with the limbic system."
The four separate systems of circuits  of the basal ganglia are arranged in parallel. Each circuit relays distinct input from various areas of the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia where information is integrated. The integrated information is relayed to the thalamus and then to different areas of the frontal cortex where the execution of motor activity is initiated.
"Each circuit consists of “closed loop” and “open loop” components. In the “closed loop” component, information arising from a particular cortical area is relayed through the circuit back to its initial cortical source. In the “open loop” component, information , is relayed to the cortical source of the closed loop."
"Although in the previous paragraphs careful attention was paid to maintain a difference between “circuits” and “loops,” in reality these terms are used synonymously. The four loops described below are really circuits, each with closed loop and open loop components. Each system of circuits consists of many distinct parallel circuits, with each circuit having a specific function."
"One circuit within a particular system may be associated with a specific movement of the foot, whereas another circuit in the same system may be associated with the same type of movement of the hand. The following circuits  have been identified: a motor loop, an oculomotor loop, an association loop, and a limbic loop. Signals from the basal ganglia are relayed to the motor cortical areas via the motor loop where they influence the upper motoneurons of the corticospinal, corticonuclear, and other descending motor tracts, which in turn influence the lower motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, and ultimately motor activity."
"The motor areas, as well as various other cortical areas, give rise to a massive number of corticostriate fibers, which terminate in the caudate nucleus and putamen . In the closed loop, a stream of corticostriate fibers arising from the supplementary motor cortex  project mostly to the putamen, the “sensory-motor area” of the striatum as well as to the caudate nucleus. The putamen projects to both the medial and lateral segments of the globus pallidus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, all of which in turn project to the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus."
"Thalamocortical fibers from the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus project back to the supplementary motor cortex, completing the loop. In the open loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the primary motor cortex , the premotor cortex , and the somatosensory cortex  are channeled to the putamen. From there the information continues through the motor circuit to terminate in the supplementary motor cortex, which is the origin of the closed loop."
"In the sensory-motor loop, signals from the basal ganglia are relayed to the motor cortical areas of the frontal lobe. There they exert their influence by planning the sequence of actions in order to execute learned motor activities. This influence is exerted on the upper motoneurons, which in turn influence  the lower motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, and ultimately motor activity."
"In the closed loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the frontal eye field  of the cerebral cortex project to the body of the caudate nucleus . The caudate nucleus projects to the medial segment of the globus pallidus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic fibers project to the ventral anterior and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus."
"Thalamocortical fibers project back to the frontal eye field, closing the loop. In the open loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the prefrontal cortex  and the posterior parietal cortex  terminate in the body of the caudate nucleus. The signals are relayed through the circuit to terminate in the frontal eye field, which is the origin of the closed loop."
"The globus pallidus and the substantia nigra also relay this information to the deep layers of the superior colliculus. The oculomotor loop has an important function in the control of voluntary saccadic ocular movements. In the association loop various association cortical areas of all four lobes project mainly to the ipsilateral head of the caudate nucleus, which is the “association area” of the striatum ."
"In the closed loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the prefrontal cortex , project to the head of the caudate nucleus, which in turn projects to the medial segment of the globus pallidus and to the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. They in turn project to the ventral anterior and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus. Thalamocortical fibers terminate in the prefrontal cortex, closing the loop."
"In the open loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the premotor cortex  and the posterior parietal motor area  project to the head of the caudate nucleus. The signals are relayed through the circuit to the prefrontal cortex, the origin of the closed loop. The association  loop functions in the planning of motor activity and determining the direction of movement."
"In the closed loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the anterior cingulate gyrus  and the orbitofrontal cortex  project to the ventral striatum  and the head of the caudate nucleus . They, in turn, project to the ventral pallidum, the medial segment of the globus pallidus, and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Fibers arising from these areas project to the ventral anterior and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus."
"Thalamocortical fibers terminate in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex, closing the loop. In the open loop, corticostriate fibers arising from the medial and lateral temporal lobe, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the entorhinal area project to the ventral striatum  and to the head of the caudate nucleus. The signals are relayed through the circuit to terminate in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex, which is the origin of the closed loop."
"The limbic loop functions in the emotional and motivational aspects of movement, manifested as various facial expressions or other body movements. Other circuits of the basal ganglia involve the substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and the pedunculopontine nucleus . The two regions of the substantia nigra, the pars reticulata and the pars compacta, both receive afferents  from: • the striatum, via striatonigral fibers; • the globus pallidus, via pallidonigral fibers; and • the subthalamic nucleus."
"The substantia nigra sends fibers to: • the ventral lateral, ventral anterior, and medial dorsal nuclei of the thalamus; and • the striatum. The former is via inhibitory GABAergic nigrothalamic fibers arising from the pars reticulata—which also sends collateral branches to the midbrain superior colliculus and tegmental area. The latter sends inhibitory dopaminergic nigrostriatal fibers arising from the pars compacta."
"The subthalamic nucleus receives afferents  from: • the lateral segment of the globus pallidus that provides GABAergic fibers, the most prominent subcortical input to the subthalamic nucleus; • the motor cortex; and • the pedunculopontine nucleus , whose fibers are cholinergic. In addition, a smaller number of input fibers arise from the midbrain raphe nuclei  and the ventral median nucleus of the thalamus . The subthalamic nucleus sends projections that terminate in both the medial and lateral segments of the globus pallidus, as well as in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, and in the ventral pallidum."
"All of these fibers release glutamate and are excitatory. It is evident, based on the above projections, that the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus are interconnected via the subthalamic fasciculus. The subthalamic nucleus modulates the output of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra, regions which contribute to the output of the basal ganglia."
"The pedunculopontine nucleus receives GABA-releasing input fibers from the globus pallidus, and gives rise to glutaminergic output fibers, which terminate in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. The neurons of the basal ganglia release the following neurotransmitters: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides . Various regions of the cerebral cortex and the subthalamic nucleus give rise to corticostriate and subthalamopallidal glutamate-releasing fibers, which project to the striatum and the globus pallidus, respectively."
"The glutamate-releasing neurons are excitatory to the GABAergic and cholinergic neurons of the striatum . Gamma aminobutyric acid -releasing neurons are inhibitory neurons. They are the principal neurons of the striatum, thus making GABA the principal neurotransmitter of the basal ganglia."
"Additionally, the globus pallidus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra also house GABA-releasing neurons. The fibers of these neurons form the striatopallidal, striatonigral, pallidothalamic, and nigrothalamic pathways . Dopamine-releasing neurons are located in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra."
"Their axons form the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, which terminates in the caudate nucleus and the putamen. These axons have an inhibitory affect on these striatal GABAergic neurons that project to the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. However, they have an excitatory affect on those striatal GABAergic neurons that project to the medial segment of the globus pallidus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra."
"These diametrically opposite effects of dopamine at different terminations are due to differential reactions of the dopamine receptors . Acetylcholine-releasing neurons are inhibited by the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, and in turn are excitatory to the GABAergic output neurons of the striatum . Neuropeptide-releasing neurons of the basal ganglia may contain the following neurotransmitters: enkephalin, dynorphin, substance P, somatostatin, neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, and cholecystokinin."
"These neurotransmitters are present concurrently with other neurotransmitters in the same neuron  . Widespread areas of the cerebral cortex project  to the caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum of the basal ganglia. Output signals arising from the basal ganglia  are relayed to the thalamus."
"In turn the thalamus projects to specific cortical areas of the frontal cortex. The information flows between the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex via “direct loops” and “indirect loops,” which are wiring patterns depicting the main circuits of the basal ganglia  discussed earlier. To demonstrate the direct loop and indirect loop, the motor loop is used as an example."
"The motor loop of the basal ganglia consists of two distinct pathways that connect it to the cerebral cortex. Through these two pathways signals from the input station, the putamen , are transmitted to the output stations, the medial segment of the globus pallidus  and the substantia nigra pars reticulata . One pathway is referred to as the direct loop and the other is referred to as the indirect loop."
"Although these pathways are in parallel, one has an excitatory while the other has an inhibitory influence on the cerebral cortex. It is via these pathways that the basal ganglia regulate the output of the motor cortex and thus regulate motor activity indirectly. In the direct loop , corticostriate  fibers terminate in the striatum , where they excite a group of GABAergic inhibitory neurons ."
"These neurons in turn send their fibers to the GPm and the SNr where they have an inhibitory influence on the GABAergic inhibitory pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic neurons, respectively. The inhibition of the inhibitory projection neurons housed in the GPm and the SNr results in disinhibition  of the thalamocortical excitatory fibers to the cerebral cortex, and ultimately stimulation of the motor cortex. In the indirect loop , corticostriate  fibers terminate in the striatum , where they stimulate another group of GABAergic inhibitory neurons ."
"These neurons in turn send their fibers to the GPl where they have an inhibitory influence on the GABAergic inhibitory pallidosubthalamic neurons. The subthalamic nucleus houses glutaminergic excitatory neurons that project to the GPm and the SNr. The GPm and the SNr project GABAergic inhibitory pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic fibers, respectively, to the thalamus, which in turn projects glutaminergic excitatory thalamocortical fibers to the cortex."
"Usually, the inhibitory pallidosubthalamic neurons cause a reduction of the excitatory influence that the subthalamic nucleus has on the GPm and the SNr. Enhanced stimulation of the indirect loop results in disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus, and thus stimulation of the inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the GPm and SNr. The GPm and SNr, via pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic fibers, inhibit the thalamocortical neurons, resulting in inhibition of the motor cortex."
"The dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway arises from the substantia nigra pars compacta and terminates in the striatum. Dopaminergic  fibers arising from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the retrorubral nucleus form the nigrostriatal pathway whose fibers terminate in the caudate nucleus or the putamen, where they synapse with GABAergic neurons. Dopamine is usually an inhibitory neurotransmitter; however, it has a different effect on different populations of neurons housed in the putamen."
"It is believed that the putamen contains neurons with up to five different types of dopamine receptors, two of which are D1 and D2 receptors. The dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta synapse with striatal GABAergic–substance P neurons of the direct loop, which possess D1 receptors and project directly from the putamen to the GPm and SNr. These synapses have an excitatory effect on the direct loop GABAergic–substance P neurons of the putamen, which terminate in the GPm and in the SNr."
"The dopaminergic neurons from the retrorubral nucleus synapse with striatal GABAergic–enkephalin neurons of the indirect loop, which possess D2 receptors. These striatal neurons project to the GPl which in turn projects to the subthalamic nucleus, which then projects to the GPm. These synapses with the striatal neurons with D2 receptors have an inhibitory effect on the indirect loop GABAergic– enkephalin neurons of the putamen."
"The nigrostriatal pathway strengthens corticostriate fiber input to the striatum concerning motor activity by stimulation of the direct loop and by inhibition of the indirect loop. The cholinergic intrastriatal interneurons, however, counteract the cortical input on the dopaminergic neurons. These cholinergic neurons stimulate the GABAergic–enkephalin striatal output fibers of the indirect loop, which has an inhibitory influence on the thalamocortical fibers."
"The net effect of the basal ganglia is inhibitory. The neurons that project directly to GPm possess D1 receptors, whereas those that project to the GPl and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra have D2 receptors. The thalamostriatal fibers arise from the intralaminar  nuclei of the thalamus and terminate primarily in the striatum, although some fibers terminate in the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus."
The function of these fibers is unknown. Hypertonicity is an abnormal increase of muscle tone in response to passive stretch. Severe hypertonicity is referred to as rigidity.
"One of the normal functions of the basal ganglia, when stimulated, is to relay signals to the motor cortex and brainstem, which ultimately inhibit muscle tone. Following a lesion of the basal ganglia, this inhibitory influence is lost and symptoms of hypertonicity are manifested contralateral to the side of the lesion. Dyskinesias include unintentional, disorderly, purposeless movements."
"The disorders of the basal ganglia may be classified into hyperkinetic disorders or hypokinetic disorders. Dyskinesias “occur at rest,” that is without volitional intent. The symptoms of hyperkinetic disorders are characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, displayed by affected individuals as tremor, chorea, athetosis, or ballism."
"Hyperkinetic disorders are caused by a disturbance of the excitatory subthalamopallidal neurons of the indirect loop. Tremoris a rhythmic, low amplitude movement that may be manifested as rhythmic nodding of the head, or in the hands and feet. Chorea  consists of a sequence of rapid, jerky, somewhat agile and flowing movements involving mainly the hands and feet, the tongue, and facial muscles."
"Athetosis  is a condition in which the individual displays slow, vermicular  involuntary movements, which usually affect the hands and feet. This condition results following degeneration of the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. Since the globus pallidus becomes silent, the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus can send signals spontaneously to the motor cortex."
"Ballismus  is the most extreme type of dyskinesia. Hemiballismus  is a rare condition most often affecting older individuals, who exhibit involuntary ballistic  movements on only one side of the body, that affect only the proximal muscles of a limb. It results following a cerebral vascular lesion of the ganglial branch of the posterior cerebral artery, which involves the contralateral subthalamic nucleus."
"The subthalamic nucleus functions in the integration of flowing movements produced by different parts of the body. Normally, the subthalamic nucleus projects glutaminergic  fibers to the two output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the GPm, and the SNr, which in turn send inhibitory projections to the thalamus. Thalamocortical fibers that are excitatory project to the motor cortex."
"Projections thus far are ipsilateral, however the upper motoneurons arising from the cortex decussate in the pyramids, thus affecting the opposite side of the body. A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus would result in disinhibition of the thalamus, which in turn becomes overactive, overstimulating the motor cortex which in turn results in hyperkinetic symptoms in the opposite side of the body . Although hemiballismus may occur following destruction of the subthalamic nucleus, it most often occurs following destruction of the striatal neurons that normally inhibit the lateral segment of the globus pallidus, which in turn exert an inhibitory influence on the subthalamic nucleus."
"Whatever the case may be, the inhibitory effect exerted by the medial segment of the globus pallidus on the thalamus is reduced, which in turn overstimulates the motor areas of the cortex. In this condition, the thalamocortical pathway, arising from the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus projecting to the supplementary motor area of the secondary motor cortex, is affected. Hemiballismus may be alleviated either with chemical substances, such as dopamine-blocking drugs or GABA-mimetic agents, or by surgical removal of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus."
Hemiballismus usually disappears several weeks after treatment. Hyperkinetic disorders are caused by a disturbance of the excitatory subthalamopallidal neurons of the indirect loop . This creates an imbalance between the direct loop  and the indirect loop .
"This causes underinhibition of the thalamic neurons, which ultimately results in excess cortical activity and movement. Huntington’s disease is a rare, inherited, autosomal dominant genetic disorder, which is associated with a gene defect on chromosome 4. The symptoms of Huntington’s disease become perceptible in the fourth or fifth decade of life as a result of degeneration of the GABAergic, substance P, and cholinergicreleasing neurons housed in the striatum, and simultaneous degeneration of the cerebral cortex ."
"At its early stages, the neurons that degenerate are the striatal GABAergic neurons that project to the lateral segment of the globus pallidus, but as the disease progresses, eventually the entire striatal neuron population degenerates. As a consequence of the loss of the GABAergic inhibitory influence, which is normally exerted by the striatum via the striatonigral pathway on the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra , the SNc dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons become overactive. This results in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal inhibitory pathway inhibiting and thus depressing the function of the striatum."
"This imbalance is responsible for the abnormal movements displayed by affected individuals. The choreiform movements are reduced following treatment with antidopaminergic drugs. As a result of the degeneration  of the caudate nuclei that occupy the lateral ventricles, radiographs reveal distended lateral ventricles resulting in hydrocephalus ex vacuo."
"In the early stages of Huntington’s disease, the cells affected are mainly the GABAergic inhibitory neurons that project from the striatum to the lateral segment of the globus pallidus . This results in a decrease of inhibitory influence on the GPl. Since the GPl normally exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on the subthalamic nucleus, this neural loss will result in an increase of the tonic inhibitory influence exerted on the subthalamic nucleus by the globus pallidus."
"The subthalamic nucleus normally sends excitatory projections to the output stations of the basal ganglia, the GPm and the SNr. The output from the  basal ganglia is normally inhibitory to the thalamus, whose output in turn is excitatory to the motor cortex. This neural loss will result in overinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus, which will in turn understimulate the GPm and the SNr."
"The output nuclei will relay reduced inhibitory signals to the thalamus and brainstem terminations. Inhibition of an inhibitory target results in what is referred to as disinhibition, which is really excitation. Thus the thalamus and brainstem terminations are disinhibited following the loss of the GABAergic neurons, which results in overstimulation of the motor cortex, and ultimately of the lower motoneurons, producing involuntary movements."
"During the early stages of the disease, involuntary, choreiform movements of the limbs and sudden movements of the face appear. As the disease progresses, additional muscles become affected, and the individual is incapable of moving, speaking, or swallowing . These symptoms are accompanied by advancing dementia and cognitive impairment due to degeneration of the caudate nucleus and the cerebral cortex."
Sydenham’s chorea results from a bacterial infection. The infectious bacteria contain antigens that are comparable to the protein receptors located in the cell membrane of the neurons housed in the caudate nucleus and the putamen. The individual infected by this bacterium produces antibodies that bind to the bacterial antigens as well as to the receptors of the striatal neurons.
"These neurons act as if they were stimulated by neurotransmitter substances and fire, resulting in choreiform movements, involving the face, trunk, and extremities. This condition, however, is temporary and the child will recover completely. In tardive dyskinesia, an affected individual displays repetitive movements of the face, mouth, and tongue, as well as choreoathetotic movements of the trunk and limbs."
"The antipsychotic drugs  block the transmission of dopamine in the brain. These drugs are aimed at the neurons housed in the ventral tegmental area whose axons form the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, but cause the dopamine receptors  to become hypersensitive. This results in an imbalance of the effect of the nigrostriatal pathway on the motor loop, causing abnormal movements."
In recent years newer antipsychotic drugs have become available that do not produce such symptoms. Hypokinetic disorders are characterized by bradykinesia  or akinesia. Akinesia is a disorder in which the affected individual is unable to plan or to direct a movement toward a desired position or target.
"Hypokinetic disorders result from neuronal degeneration in the neostriatum, disrupting the direct loop of the basal ganglia. That is, the GABAergic inhibitory neurons of the neostriatum, which normally send their fibers to the medial segment of the globus pallidus, degenerate, eliminating their inhibitory influence on the GABAergic inhibitory pallidothalamic neurons. Consequently, this permits  the tonically active pallidothalamic neurons to continually  overinhibit the thalamocortical excitatory neurons whose fibers terminate in the cerebral cortex."
"In other words, the thalamus is not disinhibited. This paucity of thalamic input to the cerebral cortex understimulates the corticospinal and corticonuclear tracts. The components of the indirect pathway though are undisturbed, thus creating an imbalance between the direct and indirect loops."
"The subthalamopallidal projections  stimulate the pallidothalamic neurons that in turn overinhibit the thalamus. Thus the insufficient thalamic disinhibition  via the direct loop is augmented by the overinhibition of the thalamus via the indirect loop, diminishing normal cortical activity, and increasing abnormal cortical activity. This discrepancy in the funneling of input to the cerebral cortex via the direct and indirect loops ultimately causes an increase in the stimulation of antagonist muscles, and not a decrease in muscular activity."
"Parkinson’s disease is the most prevalent disorder associated with the basal ganglia, affecting approximately 1% of individuals over the age of 50. It results following degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra . Due to the degeneration of these neurons, dopamine is not produced, thus there is a reduction of dopamine levels in the caudate nucleus and the putamen, where the nigrostriatal neurons terminate."
"Symptoms usually do not appear until about 80% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra have degenerated. The reduction of dopamine levels in the striatum results in an increase of acetylcholine release by intrastriatal neurons, and ultimately in the increase of the inhibitory influence exerted by the basal ganglia on the thalamus. An inhibited thalamus understimulates the motor cortex and brainstem terminations, which result in slowness, or loss of movement, characteristic of Parkinson’s disease."
"Although individuals affected by this disease may have a resting tremor, muscle rigidity, hypokinesia, bradykinesia, or impairment of postural reflexes, not all symptoms are necessarily expressed in the same individual . These individuals have no paralysis. However, the akinesia gives one the impression that an individual with Parkinson’s disease is paralyzed."
"The akinesia and the tremor generated the term “paralysis agitans. ” Individuals with this disease have a resting tremor affecting the hands, which is exhibited as a “pill-rolling tremor,” where the index finger rubs on the thumb—in a manner similar to the way that pills were made many years ago. Interestingly, this tremor, caused by the regular interchange in contraction of the agonist and antagonist muscles, is not evident when the affected individual is asleep, during voluntary movement, or during general anesthesia."
"In contrast, cerebellar tremor is expressed during movement , and is absent at rest . Also present is muscular rigidity, which results from widespread increased muscle tone. Rigidity worsens during the advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease."
"If the rigidity is continuous during a movement, it is referred to as “lead-pipe rigidity,” whereas if the rigidity is discontinuous resulting from intermittent muscle relaxations during a movement, it is referred to as “cog-wheel rigidity. ” Rigidity of all flexors results in the affected individual having a stooped posture. Parkinson’s disease is also characterized by hypokinesia  and bradykinesia  in which the affected individual has trouble in both initiating and executing voluntary movements."
"These are exhibited by a blank, expressionless, mask-like face, slow blinking, slurred speech, and lack of upper limb movements that usually accompany walking. An affected individual has difficulty getting up from a chair, walking, picking up objects, etc. A shuffling gait may also develop, in which the individual takes short steps."
"These movements begin with great effort, followed by an increase in speed, although it is difficult to stop a movement in progress. However, muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes are not influenced by this disease. In humans, melanin begins to appear in the substantia nigra around the fourth or fifth year of childhood."
"Autopsy of the midbrain of individuals who had Parkinson’s disease reveals an absence of melanin. Since dopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier, patients with Parkinson’s disease are treated with dihydroxyphenylalanine  along with dopamine agonists, an L-DOPA uptake inhibitor , and monoamine oxidase  inhibitors. In addition to pharmacologic treatment, the signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease have in recent years been alleviated by surgical procedures that involve lesions of the thalamus  or the medial segment of the globus pallidus ."
"An alternative surgical procedure includes stimulation electrodes aimed at target nuclei such as the thalamus, globus pallidus, or the subthalamic nucleus. Patients receiving pharmacologic or surgical treatment experience relief from some of the symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease; however, the progression of the disease can not be halted. Parkinson’s disease  and Huntington’s disease , are two severe disorders of the basal ganglia reflecting two opposite ends of basal ganglial dysfunction spectrum."
"If excessive LDOPA is administered to an individual with Parkinson’s disease, the individual will manifest choreic movements. L-DOPA administered to a patient with Huntington’s disease will intensify the choreic movements. Wilson’s disease is seen in young adults , and results following degeneration mostly of the putamen and the globus pallidus, although other structures such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, red nucleus, and cerebellum may also be involved."
"Degeneration is characterized by the loss of nerve cells and accumulation of protoplasmic astrocytes. Consequently, the nerve tissue exhibits small spaces, giving it a spongy appearance. Lenticular degeneration is usually accompanied by cirrhosis of the liver."
"An individual with this disease manifests symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and choreiform or athetotic movements, as well as speech disorders and a loss of facial expression. The tremor manifested by an affected individual is not tremor at rest, as that seen in other basal ganglial disease. The tremor here is referred to as asterixis, characterized as a “wing-beating” tremor, manifested following extension of the upper limbs."
"The tremor may affect the hands at the wrist, or the entire upper limb. Individuals affected by this disorder experience relief from symptoms following treatment, which includes decreasing the concentration of copper in the body. This patient has Huntington’s disease, confirmed by genetic testing."
"This patient has typical symptoms of Huntington’s disease. Chorea is the most identifiable and specific characteristic, but the most problematic and disabling symptoms are psychiatric disturbances and dementia. Chorea is a Greek term for “dance."
"” It is characteristic of lesions or pathology in the basal ganglia, especially of the caudate nucleus and putamen. However, the exact localization and pathophysiology of chorea is uncertain. Many lesions involving the caudate and putamen do not produce choreiform or similar movement disorders."
"Chorea may be generalized, as in Huntington’s disease, or unilateral, in which case it is called hemichorea. The most common cause of hemichorea is a stroke in the contralateral basal ganglia, although it may be caused by any lesion involving certain parts of the contralateral basal ganglia. A number of different conditions, genetic or acquired, can produce chorea."
"Certain medications such as levodopa, prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, can produce choreiform movements if excess dosages are taken. Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Therefore an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing the disease to his/her children."
"It affects the caudate and putamen early and most prominently, but other parts of the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex are also affected. The disease often presents itself when the affected individual is in his thirties or forties. Usually by that time the individual has had children already and may have passed the gene to his children."
"The abnormal gene is on chromosome 4 and contains an expanded trinucleotide sequence. This gene produces the Huntingtin protein. The normal function of this protein, and how the mutated protein causes the death of neurons, is unclear."
"Genetic testing is available for this disease. Huntington’s disease causes progressive and relentless deterioration of mental function, which leads to incapacity and death 10–20 years after onset. Chorea and psychosis can be treated by antidopaminergic medication; however, there is no effective treatment for the progressive dementia."
A 72-year-old woman developed sudden severe vertigo about 5 hours prior to presentation in the emergency room. The vertigo has persisted and remained severe. She became nauseated and vomited a few times.
"She has not been able to walk, and cannot even sit on the side of the bed without falling over. There was initially some double vision but this has since resolved. She complains that her left arm is “weak” and heavy."
"Her speech is mildly slurred. She feels that she is being pulled to the left when she attempts to stand or sit up. Exam shows mild dysarthria , but language function is normal."
"Bilateral end gaze nystagmus is present, which is much more prominent toward the left. Facial strength and sensation is normal. Despite the patient’s complaint, exam shows strength throughout to be normal."
"However, there is dysmetria and ataxia involving the left arm, but the right arm is normal. The patient cannot stand or even sit up in bed on her own. Sensation is normal throughout."
"Head CT in the emergency room was normal. Movement is produced by complex interactions of the basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex . The basal ganglia initiate motor activity and modulate cortical output related to motor function, the cerebellum functions in the coordination of movement, whereas the cerebral cortex is involved in the planning and execution of voluntary movement."
"The cerebellum and basal ganglia exert their influence on the brainstem and spinal cord and ultimately on motor activity at the subconscious level, indirectly, by regulating the output of the primary motor cortex and premotor areas of the secondary motor cortex. The motor cortex influences the execution of motor activity via direct projections to the brainstem nuclei  and spinal cord motoneurons. Input from the motor cortex, and the visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory systems is funneled into the cerebellum where it is integrated, and then utilized to plan and coordinate motor activity; that is, the cerebellum plays a key function in the execution of a motor task as it relates to the timing, speed, direction, and precision of muscular activity, whether of a single muscle or groups of muscles."
"Additionally, the cerebellum receives information about upcoming motor activity from the motor cortex, thus it is able to monitor the commands arising from the motor cortex that are relayed to the lower motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. This capability enables the cerebellum to compare the impending movement with the movement in progress. It also plays an active role in voluntary movement by continuously adjusting the outflow of the motor and premotor cortex, so that movement is modified to be precise, smooth, flowing, and coordinated."
"The cerebellum is the conductor behind a specific movement, since it not only determines its speed, but with the aid of projections from the visual and other systems, it also orchestrates its course. The cerebellum has important functions in proprioception, muscle tone, maintenance of posture, balance , and coordination of skilled voluntary movements, as well as in the learning and memory of motor tasks, such as playing a musical instrument and riding a bicycle. All of these functions are performed at the subconscious level."
"The cerebellum  is composed of two cerebellar hemispheres and the intervening vermis , which is separated from each hemisphere by shallow longitudinally disposed furrows . The surface of the cerebellum displays alternating, slender, parallel elevations  known as folia and depressions  known as sulci, that facilitate a great increase in the surface area of the cerebellar cortex . The cerebellum is connected to the dorsal aspect of the brainstem by three pairs of prominent fiber bundles, the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles ."
"On its ventral surface, near the middle cerebellar peduncle, a small, bulb-like region of each cerebellar hemisphere, known as the flocculus, is connected to a region of the vermis known as the nodulus. Like the cerebrum, the cerebellum consists of gray matter and white matter, organized into an outer shell of gray cortex, and a core of white matter containing deep gray nuclei. The gray matteris distributed in two regions, as the three-layered outer cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei  , which are embedded within the white matter."
"The greater part of the cerebellum is composed of white matter, also referred to as the medullary center or medullary white matter, consisting of myelinated axons and neuroglia. There are three categories of these axons : intrinsic, afferent, and efferent . 1 The intrinsic  fibers arise from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and terminate in the deep cerebellar nuclei."
"2 The afferent  fibers arise from extracerebellar sources and terminate in the deep cerebellar nuclei and/or the cortex. 3 The efferent  fibers principally originate in the deep cerebellar nuclei  and exit the cerebellum. When sectioned in the sagittal plane through the vermis or cerebellar hemispheres, the gray and white matter of the cerebellum are recognizable with the unaided eye."
"Due to the presence of the deep sulci and the extensive folding of the cerebellar surface, the arborization of the white matter resembles the branching of a tree. Thus early neuroanatomists referred to this image as the arbor vitae  . As the cerebellum develops, the cerebellar cortex undergoes considerable folding resulting in the formation of the cerebellar folia, sulci, and fissures."
"The cerebellar cortex laminates the underlying white matter of the cerebellum. Each folium consists of a thin layer of gray matter containing nerve cell bodies, as well as a white matter center, composed mostly of myelinated axons and neuroglia. As a result of this folding, approximately 85% of the cerebellar cortex becomes buried , lining the banks of the sulci and fissures of the cerebellum, whereas the remaining cortex covers the exposed cerebellar surface."
"The cerebellar cortex is simpler than the cerebral cortex, in that it is composed of only three layers  . The number of neurons of the cerebellar cortex far outnumber those of the much larger cerebral hemispheres and the neuronal organization of the cerebellar cortex, unlike that of the cerebrum, is homogeneous throughout the various regions of the cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex consists of an outer molecular layer that lies deep to the pia mater, a middle Purkinje cell layer, and an inner granular layer that lies on the surface of the cerebellar white matter ."
"The cerebellar cortex contains five distinct types of nerve cells: stellate cells, basket cells, Purkinje cells, granule cells, and Golgi cells . Although the molecular layer houses stellate cells and the basket cells, both of which are inhibitory interneurons, it is mostly occupied by the dendrites of the Purkinje cells, and the parallel fibers of the granule cells . The Purkinje cell layer, the intermediate layer of the cerebellar cortex, lies between the molecular and granular layers."
"It is occupied by the cell bodies of Purkinje cells, which are only found in the cerebellum. The granular layer is the deepest and thickest layer of the cerebellar cortex. It houses mostly granule cells and some Golgi cells."
"In addition, this layer also contains synaptic complexes, known as cerebellar glomeruli. The cerebellar cortex receives two special types of fibers: climbing fibers and mossy fibers. Climbing fibers are the axons of neurons whose cell bodies are located in the inferior olivary nucleus."
"Mossy fibers include the majority of the remaining afferents to the cerebellum that arise from widespread areas of the nervous system . Deep to the cerebellar cortex is the cerebellar white matter, which contains myelinated axons made up of afferent fibers, efferent fibers, and intrinsic  fibers of the cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex has five distinct cell types ."
We will begin with the cells of the deep  layer and work up through the Purkinje layer to the cells in the superficial  layer. The interrelationships among them are discussed later in this chapter under “Functional organization of the cerebellum” . Granule cells are the most numerous cells of the cerebellar cortex; in fact there are so many granule cells that their number exceeds the total neuron population of the cerebral cortex.
"Although the cell bodies of granule cells  reside in the granular layer, their axons continue into the molecular layer where they bifurcate to form a T-shaped configuration. These are known as parallel fibers because they are oriented parallel not only to the cerebellar surface but also to the longitudinal axis of the folium in which they are embedded. Within the molecular layer, these unmyelinated parallel fibers course through the bushy dendrites of a series of Purkinje cells, like telephone wires running through branches of a series of trees."
"A single parallel fiber establishes synapses with thousands of Purkinje cells, and any one Purkinje cell receives synaptic contacts from thousands of parallel fibers. Each granule cell, via its parallel fibers, forms glutamatereleasing excitatory synapses with the dendrites of Purkinje cells, as well as with stellate cells, basket cells, and Golgi cells. Note that the granule cells are the only intrinsic excitatory nerve cells of the cerebellar cortex."
"The Golgi cells, also known as inner stellate cells, are inhibitory interneurons; their cell bodies occupy the granular layer and their dendritic trees ramify in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Golgi cells form gamma aminobutyric acid -releasing inhibitory synapses with mossy fibers within the glomeruli. Glomeruli are synaptic complexes of Golgi cells and their terminals, mossy fibers, and granule cell dendrites."
"They are located in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. It should be recalled that parallel fibers of the granule cells as well as mossy and climbing fibers to the cerebellum form excitatory synapses with the Golgi cells. Purkinje cells are multipolar neurons that have a large cell body and an extensive dendritic tree; in fact, they are the largest neurons of the central nervous system ."
"Their flask-shaped cell bodies are located in the single-layered Purkinje cell layer, whereas their striking, flattened bushy dendrites, reside and ramify in the molecular layer. The Purkinje cell dendrites are aligned in a single plane , and are arranged perpendicular to the parallel fibers and the longitudinal axis of the folium in which they are embedded. The axon of each Purkinje cell courses through the granular layer to reach the underlying white matter core of the cerebellum containing the deep cerebellar nuclei."
"These axons, which become myelinated upon entering the white matter, terminate principally in the ipsilateral deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly the dentate nucleus, where they establish GABAergic inhibitory synapses. However, axons of some Purkinje cells  go right past the deep cerebellar nuclei, leave the cerebellum, and synapse in the vestibular nuclei. This Purkinje cell projection to the vestibular nuclei is the only extracerebellar projection from the cerebellar cortex."
"Via these projections, the Purkinje cells regulate the activity of the deep cerebellar nuclei and the vestibular nuclei. Stellate  cells are inhibitory interneurons that occupy the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. The stellate cells are believed to form taurinereleasing inhibitory synapses with the dendrites of the Purkinje cells."
"Recall that the parallel fibers of the granule cells form excitatory synapses with the stellate cells. Basket cells are inhibitory interneurons and occupy the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Within the molecular layer, axons of numerous basket cells form “basket-like” configurations that cover the cell body of a Purkinje cell."
"GABA is released at these synapses, inhibiting the Purkinje cells from firing. Recall that parallel fibers of the granule cells establish excitatory synapses with the basket cells. Four pairs of deep cerebellar nuclei, the fastigial nucleus, dentate nucleus, emboliform nucleus, and globose nucleus , are embedded within the cerebellar white matter ."
"Based on the connections between the regions of the cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei, the cerebellum is divisible into functional zones, namely the vermal , paravermal , and hemispheric  zone . These functional zones are composed of cortex, white matter, and the associated deep cerebellar nucleus , as listed in Table 13. 4."
"As the cerebellum increases in size during development, its cortex is compacted and forms alternating folia and sulci. Three of these sulci are especially deep and are known as the primary, horizontal, and posterolateral fissures . These fissures permit the horizontal division of the cerebellum into three lobes: the anterior, posterior , and flocculonodular lobes."
The flocculonodular lobe is composed of the right and left flocculi and the unpaired nodulus. The anterior lobe is separated from the posterior lobe by the primary fissure. The posterior lobe is divided into two regions by the horizontal fissure and is separated from the flocculonodular lobe by the posterolateral fissure.
"Interestingly, these lobes also correspond to the phylogenetic development of the cerebellum . The posterior lobe is phylogenetically the newest portion of the cerebellum, and is therefore also known as the neocerebellum . The oldest portion of the cerebellum is the flocculonodular lobe, and is also referred to as the archicerebellum ."
"The paleocerebellum  is intermediate in phylogenetic development and corresponds to the anterior lobe. The paired flocculi  and the nodulus  together form a small lobe, the flocculonodular lobe. Since this lobe is associated via its connections to the vestibular system, functionally it is referred to as the vestibulocerebellum ."
The vestibulocerebellum is unique since it receives direct projections  from the vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve . Some of the second order neurons housed in the vestibular nuclei also project to the vestibulocerebellum. Note that all vestibular projections  to the vestibulocerebellum are ipsilateral.
"The vestibulocerebellum  is associated with balance and posture maintenance. Additionally due to its projections to, and the influence it exerts on, the vestibular nuclei, it is also responsible for the coordination of head and eye movements. The second part of the cerebellum to develop phylogenetically arose later in evolution and is known as the paleocerebellum."
"It is composed of the greater part of the vermis, the paravermal zone , and most of the anterior lobe. This part of the cerebellum developed in relation to, and therefore has reciprocal projections with, the brainstem and spinal cord, and is functionally referred to as the spinocerebellum . Sensory  input from the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs of the limbs and trunk is relayed to the spinocerebellum via the spinocerebellar tracts, and from the head via the trigeminocerebellar fibers."
"These tracts and fibers carry proprioceptive information to the cerebellum as a movement that is being performed advances towards completion. This input is then processed by the spinocerebellum, which makes adjustments if necessary. The spinocerebellum controls posture and muscle tone."
"It also executes and coordinates muscle activity of the trunk and limbs  during stereotyped movements, such as walking. Stereotyped movements consist of repetitive movements lacking variation. The spinocerebellum is somatotopically organized; that is, the vermis controls axial musculature , whereas the paravermal hemisphere functions in the control of the limb musculature  ."
"The inferior portion of the vermis is associated with crude motor coordination, whereas its superior portion is associated with precise motor coordination. The most prominent lobe of the cerebellum is the most recent phylogenetically and is thus referred to as the neocerebellum. It consists of the cerebellar hemispheres but does not include the paravermal zone."
"Since the neocerebellum has a vast number of reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex, it is functionally referred to as the cerebrocerebellum  . The cerebellar hemispheres do not exhibit any perceptible anatomical landmark separating the paravermal cortex from the hemispheres. Due to the influence it exerts on the motor cortex, the cerebrocerebellum is associated with the planning, coordination, and execution of rapid, fine, nonstereotyped  movements such as ice skating."
"Nonstereotyped movement is characterized as nonrepetitive, variable, and of diverse pattern. The cerebellum is attached to the posterior aspect of the brainstem by three pairs of prominent fiber bundles: the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles  . These peduncles are major  communication highways whereby afferent  and efferent  fibers enter or exit the cerebellum."
"The superior cerebellar peduncle attaches the cerebellum to the caudal midbrain and the pons . This peduncle consists predominantly of efferent pathways arising from the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei—especially from the dentate, emboliform, and globose nuclei—with some fibers arising from the fastigial nucleus. The efferent pathways have four components: • the dentorubrothalamic pathway; • the interpositorubrothalamic pathway; • the fastigiothalamic tract; and • the fastigiovestibular tract."
"The fibers of the first two pathways form a bundle of axons known collectively as the brachium conjuctivum , which conveys the principal cerebellar efferent  pathway. The superior cerebellar peduncle also carries afferent pathways to the cerebellum. The input pathways are: • the anterior spinocerebellar tract, transmitting proprioceptive input from the lower limb and trunk; • the tectocerebellar fibers, transmitting visual input from the superior colliculus; • the rubrocerebellar fibers, transmitting information from the red nucleus; • the trigeminocerebellar fibers, transmitting sensory information from the head; and • the ceruleocerebellar fibers from the locus ceruleus that regulate cerebellar activity."
"The middle cerebellar peduncle joins the cerebellum to the dorsal aspect of the pons. The majority of fibers arising from the pontine nuclei destined for the cerebellum are the pontocerebellar fibers  . These fibers decussate and then pass into the cerebellum via the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle, the largest of the cerebellar peduncles, which is also known as the brachium pontis."
"This peduncle consists of almost entirely of pontocerebellar fibers. Since signals arising in the cerebral cortex are transmitted via corticopontine fibers to the pontine nuclei, the corticopontine and the pontocerebellar fibers collectively form the corticopontocerebellar pathway, which relays afferents to the cerebrocerebellum . The inferior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum to the medulla."
"It carries mostly afferent pathways to the cerebellum from the spinal cord and brainstem . This peduncle consists of two divisions: the more prominent, laterally positioned, restiform body, and the slender, medially located, juxtarestiform body. The restiform body includes proprioceptive afferent fibers from the spinal cord and brainstem to the cerebellum carried in the following tracts or fibers: • the dorsal spinocerebellar tract; • the rostral spinocerebellar tract; • the cuneocerebellar tract; • the trigeminocerebellar fibers; • the olivocerebellar fibers; and • the reticulocerebellar fibers."
"The first four tracts/fibers terminate in the spinocerebellum , whereas the olivocerebellar fibers terminate throughout the cerebellar cortex, but mainly in the neocerebellum. The reticulocerebellar fibers, emerging from the nuclei of the pontine and medullary reticular formation, terminate in the spinocerebellum and vestibulocerebellum. The juxtarestiform body includes mostly afferent fibers to the cerebellum, but also some efferent fibers from the cerebellum."
"The afferent fibers arise from first order and second order vestibular neurons and reach the vestibulocerebellum and the vermis of the spinocerebellum as vestibulocerebellar fibers. The only efferent fibers that leave the cerebellum via the juxtarestiform body are the cerebellovestibular  fibers and the cerebelloreticular fibers. As mentioned above, there are four pairs of intracerebellar nuclei, collectively known as the deep cerebellar nuclei."
"These are embedded deep in the cerebellar medullary white matter, and from lateral to medial, they are the dentate nucleus, the emboliform nucleus, the globose nucleus, and the fastigial nucleus. Recall that the emboliform and globose nuclei are collectively known as the interposed nuclei. Each of the deep cerebellar nuclei  receives input from the collaterals of afferents destined for the corresponding region of the cerebellar cortex, permitting the deep cerebellar nuclei to be informed of input as it is being relayed to the cerebellar cortex."
"The fastigial nucleus also receives vestibulocerebellar fibers, which include axons of first order neurons of the vestibular nerve , as well as axons of second order neurons from the vestibular nuclei. The vestibulocerebellar fibers transmit sensory input directly from the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear. These connections play a role in the maintenance of equilibrium."
"Although the deep cerebellar nuclei project to different parts of the brain, each one also has projections to the inferior olivary nucleus  as well as to the brainstem reticular formation. Furthermore, each deep cerebellar nucleus sends reciprocal projections to the same region of the cerebellar cortex that projects to it. It should be understood that although output from the cerebellum arises from the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei, the deep cerebellar nuclei are the main source of cerebellar output."
"The deep cerebellar nuclei influence the descending motor pathways and ultimately the motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord . The dentate nucleus  is the largest, the most laterally positioned, and the most conspicuous of the deep cerebellar nuclei. It appears similar to the inferior olivary nucleus since it resembles a “collapsed bag."
"” It receives input from the collaterals of pontocerebellar afferents and the Purkinje cell terminals originating from the cerebrocerebellum  . The dentate nucleus gives rise to efferent fibers that join the brachium conjuctivum, the major component of the superior cerebellar peduncle. These efferent fibers, joined by fibers from the interposed nuclei, decussate and project to the contralateral ventral lateral  nucleus of the thalamus."
"This thalamic projection is the major output of the dentate nucleus. The VL nucleus gives rise to fibers that ascend to terminate predominantly in the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex. One of the outputs of both the premotor and primary motor cortices is the anterior corticospinal tract, which has an important function in the maintenance of muscle tone of the trunk and proximal  muscles."
"Although the cerebellum receives afferents  from both the motor and the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex about intended motor activity via the corticopontocerebellar pathway, the cerebellum projects via a relay in the thalamus to the motor cortical areas, particularly of the primary motor area, where it influences upcoming motor activity. Additionally, a few fibers arising from the dentate nucleus exit the cerebellum via the same route but project to the parvocellular division of the red nucleus, and the oculomotor nucleus of the opposite side. The parvocellular division of the red nucleus sends fibers to the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus, which projects heavily to the cerebellum."
"The fibers terminating in the oculomotor nucleus synapse with the lower motoneurons that innervate the superior rectus muscle. Since the dentate nucleus neurons, whose axons teminate in the oculomotor nucleus, receive an input from the vestibular primary fibers, they may serve as a connection of a vestibulo-oculomotor pathway. Together, the globose  and emboliform  nuclei are referred to as the interposed nuclei."
"Afferents to these nuclei include: Purkinje cell terminals arising from the spinocerebellum , as well as collaterals of input fibers arriving in the cerebellum by way of the restiform body and via the anterior spinocerebellar tract . Axons arising from the interposed nuclei join the brachium conjuctivum, cross to the opposite side, and project to the contralateral red nucleus. Other axons project to the ipsilateral VL nucleus of the thalamus."
"The projection to the red nucleus is the major output of the interposed nuclei. The red nucleus gives rise to the rubrospinal tract, whereas the VL nucleus projects to the premotor and primary motor cortex, which give rise to the lateral corticospinal tract. Recall that the rubrospinal and lateral corticospinal tracts together form the descending lateral systems and are involved in the control of the distal musculature of the upper and lower limbs ."
"The fastigial nucleus  receives Purkinje cell fibers arising from the vestibulocerebellum, and first order afferent collaterals arising from the vestibular apparatus and second order fibers from the vestibular nuclei . The fastigial nucleus gives rise to efferent fibers that leave the cerebellum via the juxtarestiform body of the inferior cerebellar peduncle. These are the fastigiovestibular  fibers and the fastigioreticular fibers."
"The fastigiovestibular fibers terminate principally in the lateral and inferior vestibular nuclei where they influence the vestibulospinal tracts, bilaterally. The fastigioreticular fibers terminate in the pontine and medullary reticular formation where they influence the reticulospinal tracts bilaterally . Recall that the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts  have an important function in balance and posture maintenance as well as in the motor activity of the proximal limb  musculature ."
"The afferent  fibers to the cerebellum outnumber the efferent  fibers from the cerebellum by three to one. Afferent fibers pass primarily into the cerebellar cortex and they do so mainly via the inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles, although a number of fibers may enter via the superior cerebellar peduncle. Afferent signals to the cerebellum arise from three main sources ."
"1 The vestibular system , which terminates in the vestibulocerebellum. 2 The spinal cord, which terminates in the spinocerebellum. 3 The cerebral cortex, mostly via the corticopontocerebellar pathway but also via the corticoreticulocerebellar and the cortico-olivocerebellar pathways, all of which terminate in the cerebrocerebellum."
"In addition to these main sources, the cerebellar cortex also receives afferents from the hypothalamus, superior colliculi, ventral midbrain tegmentum, locus ceruleus, pontine raphe nuclei, trigeminal nerve nuclei, cochlear nuclei, and the deep cerebellar nuclei. Afferents to the cerebellum arrive as: • mossy fibers; • climbing fibers; • monoaminergic fibers; or • other fibers. Mossy fibers include most of the afferents to the cerebellum which terminate in the cerebellar cortex."
"They are excitatory, release glutamate, and arise from the vestibular system, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex via the brainstem . On their way to the cerebellar cortex to influence the Purkinje cells, the mossy fibers send collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they also form excitatory synapses. Sensory information about changes in head position and orientation of the head relative to gravity is transmitted from the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear by the peripheral processes of first order bipolar neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the ipsilateral vestibular ganglion."
"The central processes of these neurons form the root of the vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve , and enter the brainstem. Most of these central processes terminate in the vestibular nuclei to synapse with second order neurons. However, a small number of these central processes join the juxtarestiform body  and terminate ipsilaterally as mossy fibers in the vestibulocerebellum."
Cell bodies of second order neurons housed in the vestibular nuclei give rise to fibers that form a larger pathway than the fibers of the first order neurons. They also join the juxtarestiform body to terminate bilaterally as mossy fibers in the vestibulocerebellum. The afferents from the vestibular system that terminate in the vestibulocerebellum  also send collaterals to the fastigial nucleus.
"Input from the spinal cord to the cerebellum consists of: the anterior  spinocerebellar tract, the posterior  spinocerebellar tract, the cuneocerebellar tract, and the rostral spinocerebellar tract. All of these tracts relay proprioceptive information  and terminate in the cortex of the spinocerebellum as mossy fibers . The anterior  spinocerebellar tract relays proprioceptive information from the lower trunk and lower limb."
"This tract ascends contralaterally in the spinal cord, and its fibers enter the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle and terminate in the cortex of the vermis. It is interesting to note that these fibers cross twice , so that they terminate in the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the origin of the information. The posterior  spinocerebellar tract relays proprioceptive input from the lower trunk and lower limb."
"This tract ascends in the spinal cord ipsilaterally, and passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to enter the cortex of the vermis. The cuneocerebellar tract  relays information from the upper trunk and upper limb, and passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to terminate in the ipsilateral paravermal zone cortex of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. The rostral spinocerebellar tract relays information from the upper limb."
It passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to terminate in the cortex of the ipsilateral vermis. The afferents from the spinal cord that terminate in the spinocerebellum  also send collaterals to the globose and emboliform nuclei. A striking characteristic of the spinocerebellar tracts is that they relay signals to the cerebellum at a conduction velocity unparalleled by any other tract of the CNS.
"These tracts owe their rapid conduction velocity to their wide-diameter, heavily myelinated axons. This keeps the cerebellum continually informed of the current position and movement of body parts, and it enables it to make rapid adjustments of upcoming motor activity if necessary. Signals arising from the cerebral cortex are transmitted to the cerebellum via the corticopontocerebellar pathway and the corticoreticulocerebellar pathway."
"These pathways terminate in the cerebrocerebellum . The primary motor cortex, the secondary motor cortex, and the somatosensory cortex of each cerebral hemisphere give rise to more than 20 million axons that descend in the corona radiata, the internal capsule, and the cerebral peduncle to the pons and spinal cord. Approximately 1 million of these axons form the corticospinal tracts."
"The other 19 million axons are destined for the pontine nuclei , the reticular formation, and, via the corticonuclear  fibers, to the cranial nerve motor nuclei in the brainstem. Most of the 19 million fibers arising from the cerebral cortex are the corticopontine fibers, and as their name indicates, they terminate ipsilaterally in the pontine nuclei. Fibers arising from the pontine nuclei, known as pontocerebellar fibers, decussate  and gather to form the middle cerebellar peduncle to enter the cerebellum and terminate in the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers."
"The pontocerebellar fibers form the largest mossy fiber input to the cerebellum. The pontocerebellar fibers send collaterals to the dentate nucleus and terminate throughout the cerebellar cortex— with the exception of the flocculonodular lobe—in the following manner:  signals originating from the primary motor cortex are relayed via the corticopontocerebellar pathway to the vermal and paravermal zones of the cerebellum; and  signals originating from the premotor, somatosensory, and association cortical areas are relayed via the corticopontocerebellar pathway to the hemispheric zone of the cerebellum. The corticopontocerebellar pathway is the largest pathway associated with the cerebellum as evidenced by the massive middle cerebellar peduncles connecting the pons to the cerebellum."
"Based on information relayed to the somesthetic cortex from muscle receptors, this pathway transmits signals that keep the cerebellum informed about a movement in progress. Additionally, based on commands of the primary and secondary motor cortices relayed to the lower motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, it also keeps the cerebellum informed about upcoming movement. Thus these signals enable the cerebellum to monitor and adjust motor activity continuously, so that muscular movement is precise, smooth, flowing, and coordinated."
"Various regions of the cerebral cortex give rise to corticoreticular fibers that descend to synapse, mostly ipsilaterally, in the nuclei of the pontine and medullary reticular formation. Reticulocerebellar fibers pass via the ipsilateral inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles into the vermis of the cerebellum to terminate as mossy fibers where they function in feedback systems. Via this pathway, the cerebral cortex alerts the cerebellum of the initiation of a movement."
"The cerebellum then monitors motor activity and makes any necessary modifications. The cerebral cortex, in addition to projecting to the pons via corticopontine fibers  and to the reticular formation via corticoreticular fibers , as discussed above, also projects to the inferior olivary nucleus via cortico-olivary fibers. The fibers arising from the pons and the reticular formation destined for the cerebellum , are referred to as mossy fibers when they reach the cerebellar cortex."
"In contrast, the fibers arising from the inferior olivary nucleus  destined for the cerebellum, are referred to as climbing fibers when they reach the cerebellar cortex . The cortico-olivocerebellar pathway originates from the primary motor cortex, the secondary motor cortex, and the somatosensory cortex and follows the same path to the brainstem as does the corticopontocerebellar pathway. The cortico-olivary fibers, however, terminate bilaterally in the inferior olivary nuclei."
"Input from the spinal cord, the red nucleus , the cerebral cortex , and the deep cerebellar nuclei, is funneled into the inferior olivary nucleus, which is a cerebellar relay nucleus. The inferior olivary nucleus gives rise to a group of fibers that are destined for the contralateral cerebellar cortex. These are the olivocerebellar fibers, the sole efferents from the inferior olivary nucleus, that, as mentioned above, terminate in the cerebellar cortex as climbing fibers."
"On their way to the cerebellum, the olivocerebellar fibers decussate, course through the inferior cerebellar peduncle, enter the cerebellar white matter, send collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei, and “climb” to the cortical granular layer where they form aspartate-releasing excitatory synapses with granule cells and Golgi cells. The climbing fibers then continue their course through the Purkinje cell layer, where they terminate in the molecular layer as unmyelinated fibers to form powerful aspartate-releasing excitatory synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites. The inferior olivary nucleus is believed to play an important instructing role when one learns to perform a new motor skill."
The ventral midbrain tegmentum gives rise to dopaminergic fibers that terminate in the interposed and dentate nuclei as well as in the cerebellar cortex. These dopaminergic inhibitory fibers function in the regulation of cerebellar activity . The norepinephrine  fibers arising from the locus ceruleus pass into the cerebellum via the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles to terminate in the cerebellar cortex where they form inhibitory synapses with dendrites of Purkinje cells and granule cells.
"These noradrenergic inhibitory fibers function in the regulation of cerebellar activity. The fibers arising from the pontine raphe nuclei pass into the cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncle where they release serotonin in the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellar cortex. These fibers inhibit Purkinje cells, and function to regulate cerebellar activity."
"In addition to the above afferent projections, the cerebellum also receives afferents from the following sources:  the hypothalamus;  the cochlear nuclei;  the superior colliculi; and  the trigeminal nerve nuclei . The fibers arising from the hypothalamus release histamine at their terminals distributed throughout the cerebellar cortex. These fibers function to coordinate somatic and visceral motor responses."
The cochlear nuclei  as well as the superior colliculi  relay sensory input to the dorsal aspect of the vermis regarding the location and shift in position of a sound or object. The trigeminal nerve nuclei also send projections  relaying sensory input from orofacial structures and the stretch receptors of the muscles of mastication. These fibers pass into the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle where they terminate as mossy fibers.
"Efferent fibers from the cerebellum arise from two sources : 1 Purkinje cells, which constitute the ultimate integrating terminal within the cerebellar cortex. 2 Cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. These nuclei house the nerve cells whose axons form the principal cerebellar output ."
"The Purkinje cell axons of the cerebellar cortex have two destinations. The only extracerebellar destination is as follows: the axons of the Purkinje cells located in the cortex of the vestibulocerebellum go past the deep cerebellar nuclei, exit the cerebellum, to end in the vestibular nuclei. The majority of Purkinje cell axons, though, terminate locally at their main targets —the deep cerebellar nuclei."
"The Purkinje cell axons always form inhibitory synapses. It is important to note that Purkinje cell axons arising from the cerebellar cortex of the vermis, paravermal zone, or the hemispheric zone overlying the deep cerebellar nuclei project to the corresponding deep cerebellar nucleus . All of the Purkinje cells that project to the deep cerebellar nuclei send collaterals to Golgi cells, as well as to other Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells of the cerebellar cortex."
Purkinje cell axons arising from the cortex of the flocculonodular lobe  form a small extracerebellar projection as they exit the cerebellum via the juxtarestiform body to terminate in the vestibular nuclei . Vestibulospinal tracts originate in the vestibular nuclei and terminate on those motoneurons of the spinal cord that control posture and balance. Note that the flocculonodular lobe projects primarily to the vestibular nuclei  and sends only a few Purkinje cell fibers to the fastigial nucleus.
"Based on the projections of the cerebellum to the vestibular nuclei, and since both the deep cerebellar nuclei and the vestibular nuclei receive excitatory afferent fibers from the inferior olivary nucleus in addition to receiving inhibitory afferent fibers from Purkinje cells, the vestibular nuclei are considered by some to be anatomically analogous to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Thus, the vestibular and deep cerebellar nuclei share two common sources of afferent fibers. Purkinje cell axons arising from the cortex of the vermal zone project to the ipsilateral fastigial nucleus ."
"The fastigial nucleus gives rise to fibers that exit the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle to terminate bilaterally in the lateral vestibular nucleus and in the contralateral brainstem reticular formation. The vestibular nuclei give rise to the vestibulospinal tracts, and the reticular nuclei give rise to the reticulospinal tracts. Collectively these tracts form the medial descending system, which terminates in the spinal cord and has an important function in the maintenance of posture, balance, and muscle tone of extensor muscles."
Recall that the cortex of the vermis receives an input from the spinal cord. The fastigial nucleus also gives rise to a small number of fibers that pass into the superior cerebellar peduncles and ascend bilaterally to the VL nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamus in turn projects to the premotor and primary motor cortex.
"The neurons of the premotor and primary motor cortices, whose axons form the anterior corticospinal tract, control motor activity of the axial and proximal limb  musculature. The Purkinje cell axons arising from the cortex of the paravermal zone project to the interposed nuclei , which are associated with the execution and modification of movements. These nuclei in turn, project, via the superior cerebellar peduncle, to the magnocellular component of the contralateral red nucleus."
"The red nucleus gives rise to the rubrospinal tract that terminates in the spinal cord contralaterally and functions in regulating motor activity by facilitating the muscle tone of the ipsilateral flexors. The interposed nuclei also send some fibers, via the superior cerebellar peduncle, to the VL nucleus of the thalamus, which projects to the premotor and primary motor cortex. One of the outputs of these cortices is the lateral corticospinal tract."
"The rubrospinal tract and the lateral corticospinal tract together form the lateral descending system, which controls the motor activity of the distal musculature of the limbs, especially the hands. Purkinje cell axons arising from the cortex of the hemispheric zone of the cerebellum project to the dentate nucleus, which is associated with the planning of movements . Fibers arising from neurons of the dentate nucleus form the dentorubrothalamic pathway."
"These fibers exit the cerebellum by joining the superior cerebellar peduncle, decussate, and terminate to synapse in two places: the parvocellular component of the red nucleus and the VL nucleus of the thalamus . This projection to the VL nucleus of the thalamus is the principal efferent projection of the cerebellum. The majority of the fibers in the superior cerebellar peduncle originate from the dentate nucleus."
"The parvocellular component of the red nucleus gives rise to fibers that join the central tegmental tract to terminate in the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus. The VL nucleus of the thalamus gives rise to fibers that ascend to terminate in the ipsilateral primary motor and premotor cortex, which give rise to the lateral corticospinal tract. Via its influence on the lateral corticospinal tract, the cerebellum plays an important role in the planning phase, initiation, timing, and precision of discrete movements, specifically the reciprocal contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles of the limbs ."
"As discussed above, the histologic organization of the cerebellar cortex is identical throughout the cerebellum . It contains Purkinje cells whose functions are inhibitory, and four types of interneurons, three of which are inhibitory—namely basket cells, stellate cells, and Golgi cells—whereas the fourth type, the granule cells, are excitatory. Excitatory inputs to the cerebellar cortex are derived from both extrinsic fibers and intrinsic fibers."
"The extrinsic fibers are composed of climbing fibers and mossy fibers. The intrinsic fibers are the axons of granule cells of the granular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. An additional source of excitatory synapses are the deep cerebellar nuclei, which send their axons into the cerebellar cortex as nucleocortical connections."
"The inferior olivary nucleus gives rise to the olivocerebellar fibers. On their way to the cerebellum they decussate, and when they reach the cerebellar white matter they branch, send excitatory collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei, and proceed by “climbing” towards the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex as climbing fibers. There, a climbing fiber gives rise to about 10 branches that extend into the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse with Purkinje cells."
"Each terminal of a climbing fiber forms 300–500 direct, excitatory synaptic contacts with the dendrites of an individual Purkinje cell . Each individual Purkinje cell receives synaptic contacts from only a single climbing fiber. An impulse transmitted from a climbing fiber to the dendrites of a Purkinje cell generates a prolonged, oscillatory-type, powerful depolarization of that Purkinje cell."
"Additionally, the climbing fibers also depolarize the Golgi, stellate, and basket cells. These inhibitory interneurons attenuate Purkinje cell activity, which has a more potent effect on cerebellar cortical outflow than does the limited, intense depolarization of a small population of Purkinje cells that are depolarized directly by a climbing fiber. Most of the afferents to the cerebellum consist of mossy fibers ."
"Mossy fibers relay information to the cerebellum from various sources:  the spinal cord;  the vestibular ganglion and vestibular nuclei;  the pontine nuclei;  the reticular nuclei; and  the trigeminal nuclei. Afferent fibers enter the cerebellum by passing through all three cerebellar peduncles; they then course through the cerebellar white matter where they branch, and prior to their termination in the cerebellar cortex, send excitatory collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei. When they reach their destination they terminate in synaptic complexes, known as glomeruli, within the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex."
"A glomerulus has the following components: a mossy fiber, which establishes excitatory synapses with the dendrites of a granule cell, and a Golgi cell and its terminals, which form inhibitory synapses with granule cell dendrites. A mossy fiber activates a granule cell within a glomerulus. It takes a large number of simultaneously stimulated mossy fibers to activate a granule cell."
"The axon of each granule cell bifurcates in the molecular layer to form parallel fibers, which form excitatory synapses with the dendrites of Purkinje cells, basket cells, stellate cells, and Golgi cells . A single parallel fiber synapses with thousands of Purkinje cells in succession . The dendritic tree of a single Purkinje cell is traversed by thousands of parallel fibers, which establish synapses with dendritic terminals ."
"Each parallel fiber establishes only a few synapses with each Purkinje cell. Recall that, in contrast, a climbing fiber forms several hundred direct synaptic contacts with a Purkinje cell. Consequently as a result of the greater number of synaptic contacts, the climbing fiber input exerts a stronger excitatory influence on Purkinje cells than does the mossy fiber input."
"Thus it takes a multitude of concurrently stimulated mossy fibers to trigger a nerve impulse in a single Purkinje cell. Interestingly, mossy fiber stimulation triggers recurring Purkinje cell action potentials, rather than the single, sustained, powerful depolarization generated by climbing fibers. It should therefore be noted that a Purkinje cell may be stimulated either by:  a climbing fiber, directly, resulting in a very specific output signal; or  mossy fibers, indirectly, via granule cell parallel fibers, resulting in a less specific but tonic output signal."
"Basket cells, stellate cells, and Golgi cells are all inhibitory. The basket cells and the stellate cells form inhibitory synapses with the Purkinje cells. The Golgi cells are stimulated by mossy fibers within the glomeruli and by the parallel fibers that form synapses on their apical dendrites."
"The stimulated Golgi cells then respond by inhibiting the granule cells back in the glomeruli; that is, they prevent further excitability of the granule cells by upcoming excitatory impulses from the mossy fibers. Inhibitory inputs to the cells of the cerebellar cortex are derived from Golgi cells, Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells. All four types of cells are intrinsic modulator cells and they all release GABA."
There is only a single output from the cerebellar cortex— the axons of the Purkinje cells . These cells transmit integrated information from the cerebellar cortex to the vestibular nuclei and to the deep cerebellar nuclei. The neurons housed in the deep cerebellar nuclei are continually under excitatory influences exerted on them by the collaterals of climbing and mossy fibers and inhibitory influences exerted on them by Purkinje cell axons.
"The effect that these excitatory and inhibitory influences have on cerebellar input during motor activity, however, is still uncertain. These excitatory and inhibitory influences exerted on the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei are constantly balanced, hence the intensity of the efferent signals from the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei remains the same during moderate levels of prolonged excitation. However, during intense motor activity , the excitatory influence is exerted on the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei prior to the inhibitory influence."
"Thus the deep cerebellar nuclei first relay an excitatory output signal to the motor system in order to adjust the motor activity in progress, and then relay an inhibitory output signal to ultimately inhibit the motor activity. Thus, once a movement is initiated, the deep cerebellar nuclear excitatory output modifies the motor activity and, shortly thereafter, it is inhibited so as to prevent overshooting  of the movement in progress. An increase in the firing rate of the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei assures that the cerebellum provides an excitatory output signal, whereas a decrease in the firing rate of these cells provides an inhibitory output signal."
"The mossy fibers form the principal conduit of excitatory signals to the deep cerebellar nuclei by a direct projection . The mossy fibers simultaneously form an alternate pathway, which also ultimately projects to the deep cerebellar nuclei, but first relays in the cerebellar cortex. The mossy fiber stimulates a granule cell that, via its parallel fibers, stimulates Purkinje cells."
"The Purkinje cells then project primarily to the deep cerebellar nuclei, thus completing the alternate pathway of mossy fiber output to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Stellate cells, basket cells, and Golgi cells modulate Purkinje cell excitation generated by both mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Consequently, Purkinje cells have a strong inhibitory influence on the cells of the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei, modulating their output."
"It is the processing of the afferent input to the cerebellum, and its modulation via Purkinje cells, that ultimately determines the smoothing of movements in progress. It is important to remember that the cerebellum processes information derived from the ipsilateral side of the body, and from the contralateral cerebral cortex. It is well known that electrical stimulation of the cerebellum does not produce any type of sensation or movement."
"This led early neuroanatomists to refer to the cerebellum as a “silent area” of the brain. The cerebellum plays a role in cognitive functions in part via its projections to the frontal lobe, and has an important function in motor learning. It is clear that a lesion involving the cerebellum results in the abnormal execution of voluntary and involuntary motor activities, motor learning, and other cognitive dysfunction."
"Now that its internal circuitry is better understood, it has helped us understand the source of these effects. Since the intrinsic circuitry of the cerebellar cortex is identical throughout the cerebellum, it is difficult to correlate a function with a particular region of the cerebellar cortex. Instead, it is the origin and destination of the afferent and efferent fibers that facilitates functional identification in the cerebellum."
"Although the cerebellum is subdivided into three functionally distinct zones, each including cortex, white matter, and one or two deep cerebellar nuclei, lesions are rarely confined to one zone only. Generally speaking, lesions involving the deep cerebellar nuclei  or the superior cerebellar peduncles  result in more serious symptoms than lesions that are confined to the cerebellar cortical region. Furthermore, although the cerebellum is involved in motor function, a lesion in the cerebellum results in abnormal execution of a motor task and not deficits in motor function such as paralysis or paresis."
"A lesion confined to one cerebellar hemisphere results in symptoms that appear on the body on the same side as the lesion. The reason why this occurs is due to the fact that the cerebellar efferent connections and the descending motor pathways upon which the cerebellum exerts its influence are crossed. Additionally, the main afferent pathways from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, namely the cuneocerebellar and posterior spinocerebellar tracts, are ipsilateral."
"The most common symptoms attributed to cerebellar malfunction are hypotonia  and ataxia . Severe trauma to the cerebellum results in serious symptoms; however, after a variable amount of time, full recovery may follow. It is believed that other parts of the brain may “take over” and compensate for any cerebellar deficits."
"Persistent conditions, however, such as the prolonged, slow growth of a tumor, cause milder symptoms. In this case, the growing lesion and the damage produced are accompanied by continuous compensation for the cerebellar deficits. Flocculonodular syndrome has been characterized by the inability to maintain equilibrium—without an accompanying ataxia of the limbs, hypotonia, or tremor—and unsteady walking and swaying from side to side."
"The individual may also experience nystagmus, presented by rhythmic oscillations of the eyes. Since lesions involving the flocculonodular lobe may include midline cerebellar components, the symptoms may be bilateral. Following a lesion in the vermal or paravermal zones, standing is characterized by the feet positioned far apart, providing a compensatory broad base."
"While walking, the individual is unable to “walk in tandem. ” The affected individual also exhibits titubation, a condition characterized by a rhythmic tremor  of the trunk or head when sitting or standing, and postural changes of the head, in which the head may be held in a rotated position or tilted towards one side. Due to the lesion’s midline proximity, the side in which the head is rotated or tilted may not be a reflection of the side of the lesion."
"Cerebellar disease may be manifested in various abnormal movements of the eyes. The most conspicuous abnormal eye movement is spontaneous nystagmus that occurs without stimulation of the vestibular apparatus. Nystagmus is characterized by rhythmic oscillation of one or both eyes, and is manifested when the eyes are deviated laterally in the horizontal plane towards the side of the lesion."
"A lesion involving the hemispheric zone may result in numerous disorders, as described below. A lesion affecting one cerebellar hemisphere is exhibited primarily as ataxia and tremor on the ipsilateral side of the body. Ataxia  is the lack of coordination of movements."
"The timing and precision of motor tasks are impaired, resulting in awkward movement. Ocular movement disorders, of which the most common is nystagmus, is most noticeable when the individual deviates his eyes towards the side of the lesion. Ocular movement disorders result as a consequence of asynergic  activity of the extraocular muscles."
"Tremor is characterized by the exhibition of static and kinetic tremors. Intention tremor is manifested during a voluntary movement, and is especially apparent towards the end of a movement, such as when putting glasses on. Delayed initiation and termination of motor activity."
"The affected individual has difficulty initiating a motor activity, and once the activity is ongoing, he then has difficulty stopping it. Abnormal stance and gait is also seen in individuals with hemispheric lesions. The individual stands with feet apart, and tends to sway forward, backward, or to the side, resembling a state of intoxication."
"Ataxia may also be evident when moving the lower limbs. Decomposition of movement may occur following cerebellar disease. Movements are jerky, awkward, and inaccurate."
"An individual with such a lesion attempts to compensate for the awkward movements by making gradual movements such as moving one part  of the body at a time. Hypotonia  may be exhibited following manipulation of the limbs at a joint. A decrease occurs in resistance to this passive manipulation, resulting in excess movement of the limbs referred to as “loose jointed” or “rag-doll appearance,” since the damaged cerebellum does not exert its influence on the stretch reflex."
Hypotonia is velocity independent. This condition gradually diminishes over time. Dysarthria  is characterized by impaired speech that is slow and slurred.
"It is caused from lack of coordination of the muscles used to produce speech and is referred to as “scanning” speech, because of the excess and equal stress on all syllables. Dysmetria  is a disorder in which the individual is unable to estimate the distance between the moving body part and a target . Dysdiadochokinesia   is the inability to carry out rapid alternating movements regularly ."
"Dysrhythmokinesis is the inability to maintain rhythm while performing alternating movements at a fast pace. Impaired check and rebound is a condition which results from loss of cerebellar input to the stretch reflex. When a limb is displaced from a certain position against resistance , its abrupt release does not result in its return to its initial position, but instead it is displaced beyond its previous position."
"The individual is unable to stop a movement suddenly. This patient had a left cerebellar stroke in the distribution of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery . This is a common type of stroke and is therefore important for all physicians to know about, not just neurologists."
"The inferior and lateral cerebellum as well as the dorsolateral medulla are supplied by the PICA. However, many infarctions involve only part of the PICA territory and may involve only the cerebellum. The PICA arises most commonly from the vertebral artery just proximal to the basilar artery."
"Thrombosis of the PICA or the vertebral artery or emboli to the vertebral artery are the commonest causes of this stroke syndrome. The symptoms in the case above are typical. The cerebellum, specifically the cerebellar vermis and surrounding parts of the inferior midline cerebellum, have important connections with the vestibular nuclei."
"Therefore, vertigo or dizziness is common. Gait is often severely disturbed and gait testing is critical. In fact, sometimes it is the only abnormality in cerebellar disease."
"Focal cerebellar pathology causes ipsilateral ataxia or dysmetria of the limbs, as opposed to the contralateral dysfunction caused by most other brain lesions. Ocular dysfunction is common. Complaints of blurry or double vision, nystagmus towards the side of the lesion, ipsilateral gaze paresis, or other ocular paresis are common."
"Additional symptoms can occur with involvement of the dorsolateral medulla, according to the structures in that region of the brainstem. An initial head CT is usually normal unless there is some hemorrhage present. After a day or two it will show the stroke."
"MRI gives an exquisite view of the cerebellum and brainstem. Often the most distressing and disabling symptom, along with the inability to walk, is vertigo. This can be relieved with antidopamine or similar medication."
Symptoms will usually improve or resolve over time . ith sudden onset of complete left-sided paralysis and slurred speech. The head CT in the ER demonstrated evidence of early edematous changes in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery .
"A head CT 2 days later showed a very large right hemisphere infarction involving the entire right MCA territory. He had been somewhat drowsy but easily aroused during the first few days of hospitalization. He also had a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and severe left hemiplegia."
"He became more lethargic after the first few days, and then could not be aroused. He was placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory difficulties. Examination in the ICU revealed that he was comatose ."
"His right pupil was fixed and dilated. Other brainstem reflexes were intact. There was no movement elicited on the left side, but there was some movement following stimulation on the right."
"However, there was a Babinski reflex  present on the right . There was subsequent deterioration of the patient’s condition. He eventually lost all his brainstem reflexes ."
All limb movement was lost. Brain death was confirmed. The reticular formation  consists of various distinct populations of cells embedded in an intricate polysynaptic network of cell processes occupying the central core of the brainstem.
"From an evolutionary perspective, the reticular formation is phylogenetically an ancient neural complex that is closely associated with two other ancient neural systems, the olfactory system which mediates the visceral sense of smell, and the limbic system which functions in the visceral and behavioral responses to emotions. The reticular formation and the olfactory and limbic systems are interrelated as a result of their participation in visceral functions and behavioral responses. The reticular formation is continually informed of activity occurring in almost all areas of the nervous system and responds by influencing the following: skeletal muscle motor activity; somatic and visceral sensation; autonomic nervous system activity; endocrine functions; biological rhythms, via reciprocal connections to the hypothalamus, and the level of consciousness."
"The reticular formation is most prominent in the brainstem, where it forms the central core gray matter of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. The spinal cord also contains throughout its entire length an analogue of the reticular formation, the intermediate zone of gray matter. However, this intermediate zone of gray matter, consisting of interneurons, is not as extensive as the brainstem reticular formation."
"The brainstem reticular formation extends from the diencephalon almost as far caudally as the pyramidal decussation. The reticular formation contains fibers that are oriented in all planes, thus in histologic sections it appears as an interlacing structure that fills the area among various ascending and descending pathways, cranial nerve nuclei, and other gray matter. Although it appears scattered, indistinct, and ambiguous, the reticular formation, in fact, consists of numerous different histologic subdivisions each having its own distinct cytoarchitecture, specific connections, and functions."
"The neurons of the reticular formation possess elaborate dendritic trees whose branches radiate in all directions . Some neurons give rise to an ascending or descending axon, with numerous collateral branches. Other neurons give rise to a primary axon, which bifurcates forming an ascending and a descending branch, both of which then give rise to collateral branches."
"The dendrites are oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the brainstem. The elaborate radiating dendritic trees, and the axons and their collaterals, facilitate the ability of the neurons of the reticular formation to collect information from ascending and descending fibers arising from various sources, as these fibers traverse the brainstem tegmentum. Information converging on the reticular formation is integrated, and the reticular formation, via its output, influences nerve cell activity at all levels of the central nervous system ."
"As a result of its central location and cytoarchitecture, a single neuron of the reticular formation can exert its influence on various somatic or visceral functions via direct or indirect projections to higher brain centers, local brainstem centers, and the spinal cord. Many neurons of the reticular formation are involved in local multisynaptic and reflex circuits. Based on its connections , the reticular formation can be thought of as the CNS “command center” where surveillance of activities occurring in distant sites of the CNS takes place."
"It is as a result of its diverse connections that the reticular formation can integrate and modulate various activities and functions of almost all areas controlled by the CNS. More than 100 nuclei scattered throughout the tegmentum of the midbrain, pons, and medulla have been identified as being part of the brainstem reticular formation . Most of the nuclei of the reticular formation are not as clearly defined as are other nuclei of the CNS."
"Although the nuclei of the reticular formation have a number of diverse functions, they are classified according to the following four general functions: 1 The regulation of the level of consciousness, and ultimately cortical alertness. 2 The control of somatic motor movements. 3 The regulation of visceral motor or autonomic functions."
"4 The control of sensory transmission. The zones of the reticular formation are: the unpaired median zone, the paired paramedian zone, the paired medial zone, and the paired lateral zone . Some authors consider the median and paramedian zones to be one zone."
"The unpaired midline raphe  nuclei consist of intermediate-size neurons. These nuclei are present along much of the ventral aspect of the brainstem, except in areas of the basis pontis and the medulla that are occupied by various bundles of decussating fibers such as the pyramidal and lemniscal decussations. The raphe nuclei of the midbrain are the dorsal tegmental nucleus and the nucleus raphes dorsalis ; those of the pons are the nucleus raphes magnus, the nucleus raphes pontis, and the superior central nucleus; in the medulla they are the nucleus raphes obscurus and the nucleus raphes pallidus ."
"Numerous neurons of the raphe nuclei synthesize serotonin. The serotonergic neurons that project to higher brain centers are associated with sleep; those neurons that project to the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord modulate or suppress the transmission of nociception. The paramedian zone, located lateral to the midline, receives primarily uncrossed afferent  fibers from the cerebral cortex, the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, the vestibular nuclei, and the spinal cord ."
"Efferent  fibers from this zone project to the vermis, uvula, and fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum. This nuclear group functions in feedback systems associated with intricate patterns of movement. The medial zone also referred to as the “motor,” “efferent,” or “effector” zone, consists of large-size neurons."
"The nuclei of the medial zone are the ventral reticular , gigantocellular reticular , and the pontine reticular nuclei  . These medial zone nuclei contain neurons whose axons bifurcate to give rise to long ascending and descending branches, each with collaterals. The ascending fibers of these neurons course in the central tegmental tract to terminate in the hypothalamus, which controls the autonomic nervous system, and in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which function in arousal."
"The descending fibers extend inferiorly to the spinal cord by joining the pontine and medullary reticulospinal tracts. These fibers are involved in motor control of the axial  and proximal limb musculature . In addition, the medial zone of the pontine reticular formation and the rostral medullary reticular formation also give rise to the reticulobulbar tract, which terminates in the motor and sensory cranial nerve nuclei, where they function in motor control and modulation of the transmission of sensory information."
"Other fibers include the reticulocerebellar fibers, which project from the medial zone to the cerebellum . The medial zone of the caudal pons and the rostral medullary reticular formation contains small, medium, and a considerable number of very large neurons, and is called the gigantocellular  reticular nucleus. The lateral zone also referred to as the “sensory” or “afferent” zone, consists of a group of nuclei containing small-size interneurons, the most numerous type of cells in the reticular formation."
"These small-sized interneurons have short ascending and descending branches that project mainly locally to the medial zone of the reticular formation. Other interneurons of the lateral zone terminate in the brainstem cranial nerve motor nuclei. The lateral zone extends primarily into the pons and medulla of the brainstem, and is continuous inferiorly with the spinal cord intermediate zone of gray matter, which is also heavily populated by interneurons."
"The intermediate zone of gray matter should not be confused with the intermediolateral  horn of the spinal cord, which contains the cell bodies of preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. The nuclei of the lateral zone are the parvicellular nucleus, which extends into the medulla and pons; the parabrachial nucleus, which extends into the pons and mesencephalon; the pedunculopontine nucleus, which is located in the rostral pons and caudal midbrain; and the cuneiform nucleus, which lies entirely in the mesencephalon. The parvicellular nucleus  is located medial to the spinal trigeminal nucleus and ventral to the vestibular nuclei."
"It receives sensory information from the cerebrum, cranial nerves, cerebellum, and the spinal cord via collateral branches of various somatosensory pathways relaying touch, pressure, pain, temperature, and general proprioception. The lateral zone integrates the sensory information and then relays it to the medial zone. Via the reticulobulbar and descending reticulospinal tracts , the reticular formation functions in the modulation of sensory afferent input, and in the maintenance of alertness."
"The parabrachial nucleus is associated with visceral and limbic functions. The pedunculopontine and the cuneiform nuclei send fibers to brain centers such as the motor cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus , subthalamus, substantia nigra , and the cerebellum, all of which are associated with motor functions. A number of brainstem nuclei are associated with, but are not considered part of, the reticular formation."
"These nuclei are the red nucleus, the inferior olivary nucleus, and the precerebellar reticular nuclei. In addition, the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain also has extensive connections with the reticular formation. The precerebellar reticular nuclei  consist of the paramedian reticular nucleus, the pontine reticulotegmental nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus."
"These nuclei are functionally separate from the other reticular nuclei, send fibers to the cerebellum, and function in the coordination of muscle activity. The periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain receives afferent fibers from the cerebral cortex, the hypothalamus, the limbic system, the parabrachial nucleus of the reticular formation, the solitary nucleus, as well as from the ascending sensory systems. Efferent fibers arising from the periaqueductal gray matter project back to the above regions, as well as to the medullary raphe nuclei."
"Based on its connections, and its association with the reticular formation, it is believed that the periaqueductal gray matter functions in the processing of autonomic and limbic activities as well as the modulation of nociception. The reticular formation receives input via collateral branches of the ascending and descending pathways from widespread regions of the CNS. Input sources include the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and vestibular systems, the premotor and primary motor cortices, cranial nerve nuclei, the diencephalon, basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and the amygdala."
"The reticular formation gives rise to output fibers that project to the following areas of the CNS: widespread areas of the cerebral cortex, the diencephalon, basal ganglia, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, the midbrain tectum, cranial nerve motor nuclei, the cerebellum, nuclei of the autonomic nervous system, and the spinal cord. The reticular formation receives a continuous flow of somatosensory, auditory, visual, and visceral sensory information through these vast connections and in turn exerts its influence by processing, controlling, and/or modulating the following: • skeletal muscle motor activity, including muscle tone and reflexes; • somatic sensation; • visceral sensation; • autonomic nervous system activity; • endocrine functions; • biological rhythms, via reciprocal connections to the hypothalamus; and • level of consciousness. Motor activity is controlled by fibers traveling within the following fiber tracts: the corticoreticular fibers, pontine reticulospinal tract, and medullary reticulospinal tract ."
"The corticoreticular fibers arise from the premotor cortex and from the supplementary motor area of the secondary motor cortex. In their descent to the brainstem, they accompany the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts. The corticoreticular fibers terminate bilaterally in the medial zone of the pontine and medullary reticular formation in the nuclei that give rise to the reticulospinal tracts."
"In addition to receiving corticoreticular fibers from the motor cortex, the medial zone of the pontine and medullary reticular formation also receives fibers arising from other sources involved in motor function such as the basal ganglia, red nucleus, and substantia nigra via the central tegmental tract. All of the above fibers terminating in the medial zone of the pontine and medullary reticular formation modulate the activity of the reticulobulbar and reticulospinal neurons. The corticoreticular fibers, their nuclei of termination, and the medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts are referred to as the corticoreticulospinal pathway ."
"The descending fibers of the medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts synapse primarily with spinal cord interneurons, which in turn synapse with lower motoneurons, although some synapse directly with lower motoneurons. The medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts function in locomotion and postural control. The medial zone is the motor  zone of the pontine reticular formation."
"This zone consists of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis. The medial zone of the pontine reticular formation gives rise to the pontine  reticulospinal tract , which descends in the ipsilateral anterior funiculus of the spinal cord. This tract synapses with interneurons and gamma motoneurons at all levels of the spinal cord stimulating the extensors and inhibiting the flexors of the axial and proximal limb musculature."
"Furthermore, many medial reticulospinal tract fibers synapse with propriospinal interneurons that function in reflexes involving multiple spinal cord segments. These propriospinal interneurons synapse with lower motoneurons that innervate the axial and proximal limb musculature. In addition, a few medial reticulospinal tract fibers establish inhibitory synaptic contacts with the termination of the central processes of those first order neurons whose peripheral processes innervate muscle spindles, thus preventing the transmission of afferent input from those muscle spindles."
"This mechanism has an inhibitory effect on stretch reflexes, with resultant smoothing of voluntary movement. The medial zone of the rostral medullary reticular formation  gives rise to the medullary  reticulospinal tract . Similar to the medial reticulospinal tract, this tract descends  in the ipsilateral anterolateral funiculus of the spinal cord."
"Nerve fibers of this tract terminate at all spinal cord levels, where they synapse primarily with interneurons in the intermediate zone of gray matter. The lateral reticulospinal tract fibers have an opposite effect to that of the medial reticulospinal tract fibers, in that they have an inhibitory effect on extensors and an excitatory effect on flexors of the axial and proximal limb musculature. Additionally, some fibers of the lateral reticulospinal tract synapse with those lower motoneurons of the spinal cord that supply motor innervation to the distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs."
"These fibers exert primarily an inhibitory influence on the lower motoneurons that innervate axial extensor muscles, and a facilitatory influence on those lower motoneurons that innervate limb flexors. Recall that the lateral corticospinal tract functions in the execution of fine, skilled movements of the hands and feet . Note that the descending fibers of the medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts relay signals that arise from the areas mentioned above , as well as signals arising from other areas of the reticular formation."
"All of these signals are integrated and then influence the activity of the alpha and gamma motoneurons innervating skeletal muscle. Furthermore, these tracts also control muscle tone and reflex activity. Since the reticular formation functions in reciprocal inhibition, during contraction of flexor muscles there is simultaneous relaxation of the antagonistic extensor muscles."
"The medial and lateral reticulospinal tracts, with the contribution of the lateral vestibulospinal tract, function in balance maintenance and in making postural adjustments. Muscle tone, balance maintenance, and postural adjustments form a necessary background upon which voluntary movement is executed. The nucleus reticularis pontis oralis, nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis, and nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis receive sensory information from the visual, auditory, and vestibular systems, and function in head and eye coordination."
"The paramedian pontine reticular formation   of the medial zone of the pontine reticular formation is not a nucleus per se, but instead is a subset of neurons of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis that functions in mediating conjugate horizontal eye movements elicited by head movements. It receives afferent fibers from the frontal eye fields, the superior colliculus, and the vestibular nuclei, as well as from other regions of the reticular formation. Efferent fibers from the PPRF terminate mainly in the abducens nucleus of the same side that innervates the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle, and, via the medial longitudinal fasciculus, to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus to synapse specifically with the motoneurons that supply the contralateral medial rectus muscle."
"The rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus located at the cranial end of the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus contains a collection of nerve cells that function in controlling conjugate vertical eye movements . As a result of its location in the brainstem, the reticular formation is in a position to exert its influence on ascending sensory and descending motor pathways, as well as The fibers of the trigeminothalamic tract transmit nociceptive signals from visceral and somatic structures of the head, whereas the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts transmit nociceptive signals from visceral and somatic structures of the body to their target thalamic nuclei. As these fibers traverse the brainstem reticular formation on their way to the thalamus, they give rise to collateral branches that terminate in the lateral zone  of the reticular formation."
"These signals not only activate the ascending reticular activating system , which relays information to the cerebral cortex alerting the individual, but also relays information to the hypothalamus, the limbic system, the serotonergic raphe nucleus magnus, and the raphe nucleus gigantocellularis of the medial zone of the reticular formation. The hypothalamus and the limbic system function in the manifestation of visceral and emotional/behavioral responses to sensory stimuli . The serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei give rise to fibers that join the reticulobulbar and the reticulospinal tracts to descend to their target termination, the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, respectively ."
"The serotonin liberated by these descending fibers at their axon terminals stimulates inhibitory enkephalinergic interneurons, each of which forms a presynaptic contact  on the terminals of the central processes of the first order nociceptive neurons. By this mechanism, the raphe nuclei suppress or modulate the transmission of nociceptive signals from the first order neurons to the second order projection neurons that terminate in higher brain centers, specifically the thalamus, where nociceptive signals reach consciousness. For a more detailed description see Chapter 10."
"Visceral information arrives at the reticular formation from the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and limbic system. Sensory information from visceral structures that modulate the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is transmitted to the reticular formation via collateral branches derived from the ascending sensory pathways and via the solitary tract, which relays baroreceptor , chemoreceptor , volume receptor , and stretch receptor  information from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The sensory information is processed in vasopressor and vasodepressor centers located in the reticular formation, which are believed to be involved in the control of vital functions such as respiration and the control of heart rate."
"The response from these centers is conveyed via the reticulobulbar and reticulospinal tracts, to the autonomic nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord. The vasopressor center that corresponds to the rostral ventrolateral medullary reticular formation and the parvicellular nucleus of the lateral zone nuclei, gives rise to fibers that join the reticulospinal tract to descend to the spinal cord. Here fibers synapse with preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the intermediolateral column, which in turn synapse with postganglionic sympathetic neurons that accelerate the heart rate."
"Postganglionic sympathetic neurons also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, and thus increase blood pressure. The vasodepressor center that corresponds to the caudal ventromedial medullary reticular formation includes the raphe nuclei and the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medial zone nuclei. This center gives rise to fibers that join the reticulobulbar tract to terminate in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus."
"Here, fibers synapse with preganglionic parasympathetic neurons, which in turn synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the wall of the heart, which decelerate the heart rate and lower blood pressure. Stimulation of the gigantocellular nucleus of the brainstem reticular formation induces inspiration, whereas stimulation of the parvicellular nucleus induces expiration. The cardiovascular centers and the respiratory centers are thought to be overlapping."
"In addition, the neurons of the pontine parabrachial nucleus give rise to fibers that terminate in the brainstem and spinal cord where they exert their influence on the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons of the vagus nerve, the preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, and the lower motoneurons of the phrenic and intercostal nerves that innervate the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles associated with breathing movements. Interneurons located in the lateral reticular formation project locally to the nearby cranial nerve nuclei. The ventrolateral reticular formation contains neurons that participate in the coordination of the visceral functions of the vagus nerve."
"The vagus nerve innervates the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems, and via its connections with the reticular formation plays a role in eliciting reflex responses associated with swallowing, coughing, breathing, and changes in blood pressure. Interneurons of the lateral reticular formation are also associated with the trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossal nerve nuclei, which innervate structures of the mouth and face. The motor control exerted by these cranial nerves on structures they innervate in the orofacial region is coordinated by the reticular formation."
"Although motor control of the muscles of mastication—those of the tongue, lips, soft palate, and upper pharynx—is under voluntary control, during chewing the action of all of these structures is automated and is executed without our being aware of it. The branches of the trigeminal nerve transmit general proprioceptive information from the temporomandibular joint, teeth, and muscles of mastication, and general sensation information from the mouth  to the sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve. These nuclei in turn project to the motor nuclei of the trigeminal and facial nerves and to the reticular formation, which in turn coordinates the movements of orofacial structures during chewing."
"One of the most interesting associations of the reticular formation is its participation in the control of the muscles of facial expression during emotional responses. When an individual smiles while posing for a photograph, the imitation smile is voluntarily produced by descending input from the motor cortex  to the cranial nerve motor nuclei . This is sometimes referred to as a “pyramidal smile” ."
"In contrast, a sincere, heartfelt “emotional” smile is elicited by an alternate pathway, circumventing the primary motor cortex. This pathway includes descending motor input from accessory motor areas of the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia that reaches the facial nerve motor nuclei via relays in the reticular formation. This is often referred to as the “Duchenne smile” after the French neurologist and physiologist Duchenne de Boulogne who studied facial expressions."
"Individuals who have suffered a stroke that damaged the descending corticonuclear tract fibers, paralyzing the muscles of facial expression on one side of the face, are unable to smile voluntarily. However, when they hear pleasant news, a genuine happy facial expression is elicited. This may be hard to believe, but there is a neuroanatomical basis for this phenomenon."
"Although voluntary control via descending projections from the motor cortex to the lower half of the facial motor nucleus is unilateral, activation of the reticular formation by higher brain centers  that are involved in eliciting emotional facial expressions, is bilateral. The reticular formation also influences the activities of the hypothalamus, modulating the formation or release of hypothalamic releasing hormones , which in turn influence the activities of the pituitary gland. On their way to higher brain centers, the ascending sensory pathways  relaying general and nociceptive sensation, give rise to collateral branches that terminate in the parvicellular nucleus of the lateral zone of the reticular formation."
The lateral zone gives rise to fibers that terminate in the medial zone of the reticular formation. The medial zone then projects via the central tegmental tract to the hypothalamus and the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. A spray of thalamocortical fibers arising from the thalamus project to widespread areas of the cerebral cortex.
"These fibers are referred to as the ascending reticular activating system , the arousal system that functions in the sleep–wake cycle. Sensory information must be continually funneled to the cerebral cortex in order to maintain consciousness. Various levels of wakefulness are contingent upon the level of reticular formation activation."
"Waking up in the morning, remaining awake all day, and falling asleep at night, are all functions of the brainstem reticular formation. It is interesting to note that without a continuous stream of sensory input from the ARAS portion of the reticular formation to serve as an arousal system, which in turn activates the cerebral cortex, the cerebral cortex alone is unable to maintain consciousness and to function normally. Planning our day, going about our normal daily activities, and interacting with the stimuli in the environment are all mediated by the cerebral cortex."
"Pain signals that may awaken an individual from sleep are relayed to the cortex via the ARAS. The ARAS stimulates the hypothalamus and limbic system, which are involved in visceral functions and the emotional and behavioral responses to the painful stimulus. Sensory stimuli  that startle or surprise an individual, such as a snake, siren, strong odors, or unexpected contact with an unknown object, activate the ARAS, and evoke an alerting response."
"We usually awaken in the morning following the sudden sound of an alarm clock, a loud noise coming from the street, or the smell of coffee. The ARAS has to be adequately stimulated in order to activate or “awaken” the cerebral cortex. On the contrary, lack of or inadequate stimulation of this system, can result in dozing off, as may occur when sitting in a dark, quiet room."
"It is interesting to note that whereas anesthetics block the transmission of sensory signals that are relayed via the ascending sensory pathways through the ARAS to the cerebral cortex, they have no effect on the transmission of auditory signals. This may explain a curious phenomenon reported by patients that while they are under general anesthesia they are able to hear conversations by individuals in the operating room. Consciousness can be altered following head trauma, drug intoxication, anesthesia, or metabolic disturbances."
"A lesion anywhere along the path of the ARAS that affects the transmission of ARAS signals to the cerebral cortex, can result in various disorders of consciousness. Frequently, head trauma can result in increased intracranial pressure. Since the brain is surrounded by the bony skull, intracranial pressure has no outlet, and it compresses the soft brain tissue."
"An increase in intracranial pressure may push the cerebellar tonsils toward the foramen magnum, which will then apply pressure on or compress the medulla. This will damage the respiratory centers in the medulla causing a central apnea . The midbrain is quite vulnerable and lesions damaging the reticular formation can cause hypersomnia associated with slow respiration."
"When the midbrain is compressed, with consequent extensive damage of the ARAS pathways, a comatose state ensues. An upper spinal cord lesion at T6 or above will damage the descending hypothalamospinal and reticulospinal tracts that terminate in the sympathetic intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord. Normally these tracts synapse with the preganglionic sympathetic neurons residing in the intermediolateral horn, and control autonomic activities."
"This type of lesion will at first cause a reduction in sympathetic activity such as a lowering of blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, and slowed heart rate. A gradual sympathetic reflex hyperactivity appears in response to denervation hypersensitivity of the sympathetic neurons. This is exhibited as sympathetic responses such as high blood pressure, sweating, piloerection, urinary retention, and a decrease in peripheral blood flow."
"This patient had a massive stroke. The above scenario is a typical progression indicative of brain herniation secondary to progressive edema from the stroke. The edema causes swelling of the brain and since the skull is rigid the swelling follows the route of least resistance downward, and consequently causes compression of other structures."
"With severe edema there is a shift of the midline structures of the brain to the normal side, opposite the stroke , a downward shift of the diencephalon and brainstem, and herniation of the ipsilateral medial temporal lobe through the tentorium cerebelli into the posterior cranial fossa. Impairment of consciousness occurs with diffuse dysfunction of the cerebral cortex , diencephalic lesions, or upper brainstem lesions. The latter two structures are the locale of the ARAS, which is critical for maintaining consciousness."
"Lesions involving the ARAS result in coma. In contrast, a focal brain lesion affecting only part of the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter will cause no or minimal impairment of consciousness. Advancing lethargy with a focal brain lesion, such as stroke or tumor, often indicates progressive brain herniation leading to brainstem function impairment ."
Other signs besides progressive lethargy and coma are also important. Stretching and compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve  over the tentorial notch leads to ipsilateral pupillary dilation and fixed pupil. Compression or ischemia of the contralateral cerebral peduncle causes ipsilateral weakness or pathologic reflexes .
"Other brainstem reflexes such as the corneal blink reflex, oculovestibular or oculocephalic reflexes, gag reflex, and respiratory effort can be lost. Loss of all brainstem reflexes indicates brain death. A 70-year-old male has excruciating pain in the lower left part of his face."
"This began 1 month ago. He describes it as being like a jolt of lightning that radiates from his left ear, down to his jaw, and to the side of his mouth. These jolts of pain occur numerous times each day."
Between attacks his face seems normal. He denies any numbness or tingling sensations. There is no hearing abnormality.
"The pain is triggered by talking, chewing, or touch of the lower left part of his face. He is unable to eat or brush his teeth, particularly on the left side, since he fears triggering another painful attack. He can only drink his meals through a straw and cannot lie in bed on his left side."
"He had the same symptoms about 2 years ago. At that time he was treated with a medication which helped; symptoms subsided, but he stopped taking the medicine. The pain is so distressing that the patient admits to contemplating suicide."
"The general and neurologic exam is normal, except that he withdraws and will not let anyone touch the left side of his face. There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves emerging from the brain and radiating from its surface . They pass through skull foramina, fissures, or canals to exit the cranial vault and then distribute their innervation to their respective structures in the head and neck."
"One of the cranial nerves, the vagus  continues into the trunk where it innervates various thoracic and abdominal organs. In addition to being named, the cranial nerves are numbered sequentially with Roman numerals in the order in which they arise from the brain, rostrally to caudally. The following list includes their names and corresponding numbers."
I Olfactory nerve. II Optic nerve. III Oculomotor nerve.
IV Trochlear nerve. V Trigeminal nerve. VI Abducent nerve.
VII Facial nerve. VIII Vestibulocochlear nerve. IX Glossopharyngeal nerve.
X Vagus nerve. XI Spinal accessory nerve. XII Hypoglossal nerve.
"Although the cranial nerves and their sensory and parasympathetic ganglia  form part of the peripheral nervous system, the optic nerve is really an outgrowth of the brain that emerges from the prosencephalon , and is therefore not a typical cranial nerve. Moreover, part of the spinal accessory nerve arises from the cervical spinal cord; thus there are only nine pairs of cranial nerves that emerge from the brainstem. The main sensory and motor nuclei of the cranial nerves are shown in Fig."
"15. 2. In describing the various functional components  of the cranial nerves, the definition of the following terms should be kept in mind: afferent is sensory input; efferent is motor output that may be somatic to skeletal muscles or visceral to smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands, and pecial visceral efferent to striated muscles derived from the branchial arches; general refers to those components that may be carried by cranial nerves as well as spinal nerves; special refers to functional components that are carried by cranial nerves only."
"The following categories describe the functional components carried by the various cranial nerves . 1 General somatic afferent . These fibers carry general sensation  from cutaneous structures and mucous membranes of the head, and general proprioception  from somatic structures such as muscles, tendons, and joints of the head and neck."
"The trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves transmit GSA input to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. 2 General somatic efferent . These fibers provide general motor innervation to skeletal muscles derived from embryonic somites."
"The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nerves innervate the extraocular muscles that control eye movements, whereas the hypoglossal nerve supplies motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue, mediating movement of the tongue. 3 General visceral afferent . General sensation from the viscera is transmitted by the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves."
"4 General visceral efferent . These fibers provide visceral motor  innervation to the viscera. The only cranial nerves that transmit parasympathetic fibers are the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves."
"5 Special somatic afferent . These fibers carry special sensory input from the eye , for vision, and from the ear . The only nerves transmitting this component are the optic and vestibulocochlear nerves."
"6 Special visceral afferent . These are special sensory fibers from the viscera. These fibers convey the special sense of smell transmitted by the olfactory nerve and the special sense of taste transmitted by the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves."
"7 Special visceral efferent . These motor fibers are special because they supply motor innervation to skeletal muscles of branchial arch origin. These fibers are carried by the nerves of the branchial arches, which are the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves."
"Table 15. 4 summarizes the modalities, nuclei, ganglia, and functions of the cranial nerves. The bipolar olfactory receptor cells  of the olfactory apparatus reside not in a sensory ganglion, but instead in the olfactory epithelium  of the modified nasal mucosa lining the roof and adjacent upper walls of the nasal cavities ."
"The axons of these bipolar neurons are SVA fibers transmitting olfactory sensation. These axons assemble to form bundles, the olfactory fila , which collectively form cranial nerve I. The olfactory fila traverse the fenestrations of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to terminate in the olfactory bulb where they synapse with second order relay neurons and interneurons ."
"The optic nerve mediates the special sense of vision via its SSA fibers. Light entering the eye activates cells known as rods and cones, the photoreceptors of the retina. Electrical signals generated by the photoreceptors are transmitted to other cells of the retina that process and integrate sensory input."
"The first order sensory bipolar neurons of the visual pathway reside in the retina and transmit electrical signals of visual sensory input to the multipolar second order ganglion cells of the retina. The ganglion cells give rise to unmyelinated axons that converge at the optic disc and traverse the lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like perforated area of the sclera, to emerge from the back of the eyebulb. At this point, the ganglion cell axons acquire a myelin sheath and assemble to form the optic nerve."
"This nerve, an outgrowth of the diencephalon, leaves the orbit via the optic canal to enter the middle cranial fossa. There, the optic nerves of the right and left sides join each other to form the optic chiasma  where partial decussation of the optic nerve fibers of the two sides takes place. All ganglion cell axons arising from the nasal half of the retina decussate to the opposite optic tract."
"All ganglion cell axons arising from the temporal half of the retina proceed  without decussating and join the optic tract of the same side. The ganglion cell axons coursing in each optic tract curve around the cerebral peduncle to terminate and relay visual input in one of the following four regions of the brain: the lateral geniculate nucleus, a thalamic relay station for vision; the superior colliculus, a mesencephalic relay station for vision associated with somatic reflexes; the pretectal area, a mesencephalic region associated with autonomic reflexes; and the hypothalamus . The oculomotor nerve supplies skeletal motor  innervation to the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles  and the levator palpebrae superioris muscle ."
"It also provides parasympathetic   innervation to the ciliary and sphincter pupillae muscles, two intrinsic smooth muscles of the eye. The triangular-shaped oculomotor nuclear complex is located in the mesencephalon. It is situated ventral to the periaqueductal gray, adjacent to the midline at the level of the superior colliculus."
"The oculomotor nucleus consists of several subnuclei representing each of the extraocular muscles. These subnuclei are composed of groups of nerve cell bodies of the GSE neurons that innervate the listed extraocular muscles and the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The cell group innervating the levator palpebrae superioris is located in the midline, sending motor fibers to this muscle bilaterally ."
"The cell group innervating the superior rectus sends projections to the opposite side; whereas the cell group innervating the medial rectus, inferior oblique, and inferior rectus sends projections to the same side. The Edinger–Westphal nucleus, a subnucleus of the oculomotor nuclear complex is located dorsally, medially, and rostral to the GSE nuclear complex. It contains the cell bodies of GVE preganglionic parasympathetic neurons whose axons join the GSE fibers as they converge and pass ventrally in the midbrain to emerge from the ventral aspect of the brainstem in the interpeduncular fossa as the oculomotor nerve."
"The oculomotor nerve proceeds anteriorly within the cranial vault, travels within the cavernous sinus, and by passing through the superior orbital fissure, enters the ipsilateral orbit. Within the orbit, the oculomotor nerve gives rise to branches carrying the GSE fibers that innervate the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and all but two of the extraocular muscles. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve terminate in the ciliary ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic nerve cell bodies."
"Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers exit the ganglion and reach the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscles via the short ciliary nerves to provide them with parasympathetic innervation. The parasympathetic fibers, when stimulated, cause contraction of the sphincter pupillae muscle, which results in constriction of the pupil. Pupillary constriction reduces the amount of light that impinges on the retina."
"Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system causes pupillary constriction . Ciliary muscle contraction releases the tension on the suspensory ligaments of the lens, changing its thickness to become more convex. This accommodates the lens for near vision."
"GSA pseudounipolar neurons, whose cell bodies reside within the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, send their peripheral processes to terminate in the muscle spindles of the extraocular muscles. These fibers travel via the branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. GSA  sensory input is transmitted from the muscle spindles via the spindle afferents centrally to the trigeminal nuclear complex, mediating coordinated and synchronized eye movements by reflex and voluntary control of muscles."
"nilateral damage to the oculomotor nerve results in deficits in the ipsilateral eye. The following ipsilateral muscles will be paralyzed: the levator palpebrae superioris, resulting in ptosis  of the upper eyelid; the superior and inferior recti, resulting in an inability to move the eye vertically; and the medial rectus, resulting in an inability to move the eye medially. The eye deviates laterally , resulting in lateral strabismus."
"This causes the eyes to become misaligned as one eye deviates from the midline, resulting in horizontal diplopia . The inferior oblique is also paralyzed. Since the innervation to the lateral rectus  and superior oblique  muscles is intact and these two muscles are functional, the eye ipsilateral to the lesion deviates inferiorly and laterally ."
The sphincter pupillae muscle becomes nonfunctional due to interruption of its parasympathetic innervation. The pupil ipsilateral to the lesion will remain dilated  and does not respond  to a flash of light. This may be the first clinical sign of intracranial pressure on the GVE fibers of the oculomotor nerve.
"The ciliary muscle is also nonfunctional due to interruption of its parasympathetic innervation, and cannot accommodate the lens for near vision . The trochlear nerve provides motor innervation to only one of the extraocular muscles of the eye, the superior oblique muscle . The nerve cell bodies of GSE neurons reside in the trochlear nucleus, which lies adjacent to the midline in the tegmentum of the caudal midbrain."
"Fibers arising from this nucleus initially descend for a short distance in the brainstem and then course dorsally in the periaqueductal gray matter. The fibers decussate posteriorly and emerge from the brainstem at the junction of the pons and midbrain, just below the inferior colliculus. The trochlear nerve is unique because it is the only cranial nerve whose fibers originate totally from the contralateral nucleus, it surfaces on the dorsal aspect of the brainstem, and it is the smallest  of the cranial nerves."
"As the trochlear nerve emerges from the brainstem, it curves around the cerebral peduncle and proceeds anteriorly within the cavernous sinus to pass into the orbit via the superior orbital fissure. Consequently, this cranial nerve has the longest intracranial course and is highly susceptible to increased intracranial pressure. Damage to the trochlear nucleus results in paralysis or paresis of the contralateral superior oblique muscle, whereas damage to the trochlear nerve results in the same deficits but in the ipsilateral muscle."
"Normally, contraction of the superior oblique muscle causes the eye to intort  accompanied by simultaneous depression  and lateral  movement of the bulb of the eye. This is sometimes referred to as the “Salvation Army muscle” . Intorsion of the eyeball is the turning of the eyeball around its axis, so that the superior pole of the eyeball turns inward."
"Imagine that extreme intorsion  will bring the superior pole of the eye facing the medial wall of the orbit. When the superior oblique muscle is paralyzed, the ipsilateral eye will extort  accompanied by simultaneous upward and outward movement of the eye . This is caused by the unopposed inferior oblique muscle and results in external strabismus."
"Since the eyes become misaligned following such a lesion, an individual with trochlear nerve palsy experiences vertical diplopia , accompanied by weakness of downward movement of the eye, most notably in an effort to adduct the eye . The diplopia is most apparent to the individual when descending stairs or while reading . To counteract the diplopia and to restore proper eye alignment, the individual realizes that the diplopia is reduced as he tilts his head towards the side of the unaffected eye ."
"Normally, tilting of the head to one side elicits a reflex rotation about the anteroposterior axis of the eyes in the opposite direction , so that the image of an object will remain fixed on the retina. Tilting of the head toward the unaffected side causes the unaffected eye to rotate inward and become aligned with the affected eye which is rotated outward. Also, pointing the chin downward  rolls the normal eye upward."
"The trigeminal system consists of the trigeminal nerve, ganglion, nuclei, tracts, and central pathways. The trigeminal sensory pathway, which transmits touch, nociception, and thermal sensation, consists of a three neuron sequence  from the periphery to the cerebral cortex respectively . The peripheral processes of the first order neurons radiating from the trigeminal ganglion gather to form three separate nerves, the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve whose peripheral endings terminate in sensory receptors of the orofacial region."
"Their cell bodies are housed in the trigeminal ganglion. The central processes of these neurons enter the pons, join the spinal tract of the trigeminal, and terminate in the trigeminal nuclei where they establish synaptic contacts with second order neurons housed in these nuclei. The trigeminal nuclei, with the exception of the mesencephalic nucleus, contain second order neurons as well as interneurons."
"The second order neurons give rise to fibers that may or may not decussate in the brainstem and join the ventral or dorsal trigeminal lemnisci. These lemnisci ascend to relay trigeminal sensory input to the ventral posterior medial  nucleus of the thalamus, where they synapse with third order neurons. The third order neurons then relay sensory information to the postcentral gyrus  of the cerebral cortex for further processing."
"The trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve. It provides the major GSA innervation  to part of the scalp, most of the dura mater, the conjuctiva and cornea of the eye, the face, nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses, palate, temporomandibular joint, lower jaw, oral cavity, and teeth. It also provides SVE  innervation to the muscles of mastication , and the mylohyoid, anterior belly of the digastric, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles."
"The trigeminal nerve is the only cranial nerve whose sensory root enters and motor root exits at the ventrolateral aspect of the pons . The larger, sensory root consists of the central processes  of the pseudounipolar sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. These axons enter the pons to terminate in the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex of the brainstem."
"The motor root is smaller and consists of the axons of motor  neurons exiting the pons . The motor root joins the sensory portion of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve just outside the skull, to form the mandibular trunk. Before the motor root joins it, the trigeminal nerve displays a swelling, the trigeminal ganglion, which lies in a bony depression of the petrous temporal bone on the floor of the middle cranial fossa."
"Since this is a sensory ganglion there are no synapses occurring here. As the peripheral processes of the pseudounipolar neurons exit the ganglion, they form three divisions . These divisions traverse the foramina of the skull to exit the cranial vault on their way to reach the structures they innervate."
"The ophthalmic division is purely sensory and innervates the upper part of the face; the maxillary division is also purely sensory  and innervates the middle part of the face. The mandibular division is mixed, that is it carries sensory innervation to the lower face and branchiomotor innervation to the muscles listed above. The trigeminal system includes four nuclei: one motor nucleus, the motor nucleus of the trigeminal; and three sensory nuclei, the main  sensory nucleus of the trigeminal, the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal, and the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal ."
"The motor nucleus of the trigeminal is located at the midpontine levels, medial to the main sensory nucleus. It contains interneurons and the cell bodies of multipolar alpha and gamma motor  neurons whose axons form the motor root of the trigeminal nerve as they exit the pons. The branchiomotor fibers join the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and are distributed to the muscles of mastication as well as to the mylohyoid, anterior belly of the digastric, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles."
"The sensory nuclei consist of a long cylinder of cells, which extends from the mesencephalon to the first few cervical spinal cord levels. Two of these nuclei—the main sensory nucleus and the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal—receive the first order afferent terminals of pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the trigeminal ganglion. These nuclei serve as the first sensory relay station of the trigeminal system."
"The main  sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is located in the midpons. Based on its anatomical and functional characteristics, it is homologous to the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus. It is associated with the transmission of mechanoreceptor information for discriminatory  tactile and pressure sense."
"The mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal is unique, since it is a true “sensory ganglion” , containing cells that are both structurally and functionally ganglion cells. During development, neural crest cells are believed to become embedded within the CNS, instead of becoming part of the peripheral nervous system, as other sensory ganglia. This nucleus houses the cell bodies of sensory  pseudounipolar neurons, thus there are no synapses in the mesencephalic nucleus."
"The peripheral large-diameter myelinated processes of these neurons convey GP input from the muscles innervated by the trigeminal nerve and the extraocular muscles, as well as from the periodontal ligament of the teeth. The spinal nucleus of the trigeminal is the largest nucleus of the three nuclei. It extends from the midpontine region to level C3 of the spinal cord, and is continuous inferiorly with the dorsal-most laminae  of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord."
"This nucleus consists of three subnuclei: the rostral-most subnucleus oralis , the caudal-most subnucleus caudalis , and the intermediate subnucleus interpolaris . The subnucleus oralis merges with the main sensory nucleus superiorly and extends to the pontomedullary junction inferiorly. It is associated with the transmission of discriminative  tactile sense from the orofacial region."
"The subnucleus interpolaris is also associated with the transmission of tactile sense, as well as dental pain, whereas the subnucleus caudalis is associated with the transmission of nociception and thermal sensations from the head. The subnucleus caudalis extends from the level of the obex  to the C3 level of the spinal cord. It is the homologue of the substantia gelatinosa since their neurons have similar cellular morphology, synaptic connections, and functions."
"Since the subnucleus caudalis lies immediately superior to the substantia gelatinosa of the cervical spinal cord levels, it is also referred to as the “medullary dorsal horn. ” The trigeminal nerve does not have any parasympathetic nuclei in the CNS, or parasympathetic ganglia in the peripheral nervous system. However, it is anatomically associated with the parasympathetic ganglia of other cranial nerves  and carries their autonomic “hitchhikers” to their destination."
"The spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve consists of ipsilateral first order afferent fibers of sensory trigeminal ganglion neurons and mediates tactile, thermal, and nociceptive sensibility from the orofacial region to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. The spinal tract of the trigeminal also carries first order sensory axons of the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves. These nerves terminate in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, conveying GVA or GSA sensory input from their respective areas of innervation to be processed by the trigeminal system."
"The spinal tract descends lateral to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, its fibers synapsing with neurons at various levels along the extent of this nucleus. Inferiorly this tract overlaps the dorsolateral fasciculus of Lissauer at upper cervical spinal cord levels. The ventral trigeminal lemniscus  consists of mainly crossed nerve fibers from the main sensory and spinal nuclei of the trigeminal."
"This tract relays mechanoreceptor input for discriminatory tactile and pressure sense  as well as sharp, welllocalized pain and temperature and nondiscriminatory  touch sensation  to the contralateral ventral posterior medial  nucleus of the thalamus. The dorsal trigeminal lemniscus  carries uncrossed nerve fibers from the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal, relaying discriminatory tactile and pressure sense information to the ipsilateral VPM nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamus also receives indirect trigeminal nociceptive  input via the reticular formation ."
"Nearly half of the sensory fibers in the trigeminal nerve are Aβ myelinated discriminatory touch fibers. As the central processes of pseudounipolar  neurons enter the pons, they bifurcate into short ascending fibers, which synapse in the main sensory nucleus, and long descending fibers, which terminate and synapse mainly in the subnucleus oralis and less frequently in the subnucleus interpolaris of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. These fibers descend in the spinal trigeminal tract to reach their target subnuclei."
"Some second order fibers from the main sensory nucleus cross the midline and join the ventral trigeminal lemniscus to ascend and terminate in the contralateral VPM nucleus of the thalamus. Other second order fibers from the main sensory nucleus do not cross. They form the dorsal trigeminal lemniscus, and then ascend and terminate in the ipsilateral VPM nucleus of the thalamus."
Descending fibers terminating in the subnucleus oralis or interpolaris synapse with second order neurons whose fibers cross the midline and ascend in the ventral trigeminal lemniscus to the contralateral VPM nucleus of the thalamus. The VPM nucleus of the thalamus houses third order neurons that give rise to fibers relaying touch and pressure information to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex. The remaining half of the sensory fibers in the trigeminal nerve are similar to the Aδ and C nociceptive and temperature fibers of the spinal nerves.
"As the central processes of pseudounipolar neurons enter the pons, they descend in the spinal tract of the trigeminal and most of them synapse in the subnucleus caudalis of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. Nociceptive sensory input relayed in the subnucleus caudalis is modified, filtered, and integrated prior to its transmission to higher brain centers. Interneurons located in the subnucleus caudalis project superiorly to the subnucleus oralis and interpolaris of the spinal nucleus and to the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal, where they modulate the synaptic activity and relay of sensory input from all of these nuclei to higher brain centers."
"Furthermore, interneurons residing in the subnucleus oralis and interpolaris project to the subnucleus caudalis where they may in turn modulate the neural activity there. Most of the second order fibers from the subnucleus caudalis cross the midline and join the contralateral ventral trigeminal lemniscus, whereas others join the ipsilateral ventral trigeminal lemniscus. All the fibers ascend to the VPM nucleus of the thalamus where they synapse with third order neurons in that nucleus."
"The fibers of third order neurons ascend in the posterior limb of the internal capsule to relay somatosensory information from the trigeminal system to the postcentral gyrus of the somatosensory cortex for further processing. Electrophysiological observations have indicated that electrical stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter, the medullary raphe nuclei, or the reticular nuclei, has an inhibitory effect on the nociceptive neurons of the subnucleus caudalis. Substance P, a peptide in the axon terminals of smalldiameter first order neurons, has been associated with the transmission of nociceptive impulses."
"A large number of substance P axon terminals have been located in the subnucleus caudalis. Opiate receptors have also been found in the subnucleus caudalis, which can be blocked by opiate antagonists. These findings indicate that there may be an endogenous opiate analgesic system that could modulate the transmission of nociceptive input from the subnucleus caudalis to higher brain centers."
"Branchiomotor neurons housed in the motor nucleus of the trigeminal give rise to fibers which, upon exiting the pons, form the motor root of the trigeminal nerve . This short root joins the sensory fibers of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve outside the skull. Motor fibers are distributed peripherally via the motor branches of the mandibular division, providing motor innervation to the muscles of mastication  and the mylohyoid, anterior belly of the digastric, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles."
"The peripheral processes of the pseudounipolar neurons housed in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal accompany the motor root of the trigeminal as they both exit the pons. These peripheral processes follow:  the motor branches of the mandibular division to the muscle spindles of the muscles of mastication;  the orbital branches of the ophthalmic division to the muscle spindles of the extraocular muscles; and  the dental branches of the maxillary and mandibular divisions to the sensory receptors of the periodontal ligament of the maxillary and mandibular teeth, respectively. The central processes of the neurons transmitting general proprioceptive input from all the muscles and from the periodontal ligament synapse in the main sensory nucleus and in the motor nucleus of the trigeminal, as well as in the reticular formation to mediate reflex responses."
"The jaw jerk reflex is a monosynaptic, myotatic  reflex for the masseter and temporalis muscles. A hammer gently tapped on the chin causes the intrafusal muscle fibers within the muscle spindles of the  masseter and temporalis muscles to stretch, which stimulate the sensory nerve fibers innervating them. The cell bodies of these sensory pseudounipolar neurons are located in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal ."
"Their peripheral processes, which terminate in the muscle spindles , form the afferent limb of the reflex arc. The central processes of these neurons synapse in the motor nucleus of the trigeminal bilaterally, as well as in the main sensory nucleus and the reticular formation. The efferent limb of this reflex arc is formed by the motoneuron fibers traveling to the masseter and temporalis muscles  to cause them to contract and compensate for the stretch."
"Skull fractures may cause a unilateral lesion of the branchiomotor fibers to the muscles of mastication, which will result in a flaccid paralysis or paresis with subsequent muscle atrophy of the ipsilateral muscles of mastication. This becomes apparent upon muscle palpation when the patient is asked to clench his jaw. When depressing the lower jaw it deviates towards the affected side  primarily due to the unopposed action of the lateral pterygoid muscle of the unaffected side."
This impairs chewing on the lesion side due to muscle paralysis. Damage to the fibers innervating the tensor tympani muscle results in hyperacusis  and impaired hearing on the ipsilateral side. Damage to the GSA fibers of the mandibular division will result in loss of sensation from the areas supplied by the branches of this division.
"Although the trigeminal nerve has an extensive distribution in the head, there is minimal overlapping of the areas innervated by its three divisions, especially in the central region of the face. Lesions in the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve can be located by testing for sensory deficits in the areas that are innervated by each of the three trigeminal divisions. If a lesion is located distal to the joining of the autonomic fibers that hitchhike with the trigeminal branches to the lacrimal gland or the salivary glands, then both sensory and autonomic innervation are interrupted."
Infection of the trigeminal ganglion by herpes zoster virus  causes a significant amount of pain as well as damage to the sensory fibers of the three trigeminal divisions . This results in loss of sensation on the affected side. Damage to the sensory fibers innervating the cornea  results in a loss of the corneal reflex when the ipsilateral eye is stimulated .
"Trigeminal neuralgia  A common clinical concern regarding the trigeminal nerve is trigeminal neuralgia. This condition results from idiopathic etiology  and is manifested as intense, sudden onset, and recurrent unilateral pain in the distribution of one of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve, most commonly the maxillary division. There may be a trigger zone in the distribution of the affected trigeminal division, and if it is stimulated it may trigger an attack that usually lasts for less than a minute."
"This condition may be treated pharmacologically or surgically. Surgical treatment includes sectioning of the affected trigeminal division as it emerges from the trigeminal ganglion or producing a lesion in the trigeminal ganglion. Although these procedures may alleviate the excruciating pain experienced by patients, they also abolish tactile sensation from the affected area."
"Sectioning of the descending spinal trigeminal tract proximal to its termination in the subnucleus caudalis selectively obliterates the afferents relaying nociception but spares the fibers relaying tactile sensation from the orofacial region. The abducent nerve supplies motor innervation to the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye . The abducent nerve exits the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction, then courses anteriorly, traverses the cavernous sinus, and upon leaving the sinus it passes via the superior orbital fissure into the orbital fossa where it innervates the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle."
"Normally, both eyes move together regardless of the direction of gaze. This is achieved by precise coordinated action of all the extraocular muscles of both eyes. The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei are interconnected and are controlled by higher brain centers of the cerebral cortex as well as by the brainstem."
"During horizontal gaze, when looking to one side, the lateral rectus muscle of one side and the medial rectus muscle of the contralateral side contract simultaneously. The abducens nucleus and the internal genu of the facial nerve form an elevation, known as the facial colliculus  in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Axons emerging from the abducens nucleus belong to GSE nerve cell bodies."
"The axons course ventrally in the pontine tegmentum to exit in the ventral aspect of the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction. The abducens nucleus contains two different populations of neurons . One group  consists of the GSE motoneurons, whose axons form the abducent nerve and project to the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle."
"The second group consists of internuclear neurons. Their axons emerge from the nucleus, immediately decussate and project via the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus  to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. There the internuclear neuron terminals synapse with motoneurons that project to and innervate the medial rectus muscle."
"The MLF interconnects the abducens, trochlear, and oculomotor nuclei so that the two eyes move in unison. Thus the abducens nucleus mediates conjugate horizontal movement of the eyes. When higher brain centers stimulate the abducens nucleus the following occur simultaneously: 1 Stimulation of the GSE motoneurons of the abducens nucleus that cause the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle to contract, causing the eye to abduct."
"2 Stimulation of the internuclear neurons of the same abducens nucleus that project, via the contralateral MLF, to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. Here they form excitatory synapses with the motoneurons projecting to the contralateral medial rectus muscle causing it to contract so that the opposite eye adducts, resulting in coordinated lateral gaze. GSA input from the lateral rectus muscle is transmitted centrally to the trigeminal nuclear complex via the processes of pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are believed to reside in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve."
"A lesion in the abducent nerve  results in paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle that normally abducts the eye. The eye will then deviate medially as a result of the unopposed action of the medial rectus . The individual can turn the ipsilateral eye from its medial position to the center , but not beyond it."
"This paralysis results in medial strabismus . Since the eyes become misaligned, the individual experiences horizontal diplopia . The diplopia is greatest in an effort to look toward the side of the lesion and it is reduced by looking towards the unaffected side since the visual axes become parallel."
"The individual realizes that the diplopia is reduced by turning his head slightly so that his chin is pointing toward the side of the lesion. Bilateral abducent nerve lesion results in the individual becoming “cross-eyed. ” A lesion involving the abducens nucleus  results in the same deficiency as a lesion to the abducent nerve, with the addition of the inability to turn the opposite eye medially as the individual attempts to gaze toward the side of the lesion."
"This condition, referred to as lateral gaze paralysis, occurs because the damaged abducens nucleus no longer provides excitatory input to the opposite oculomotor nucleus neurons that innervate the medial rectus muscle. If the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nerves and their nuclei are intact, but there is a unilateral MLF lesion, eye movements in all directions are possible. However, since the connections between the nuclei of these nerves are interrupted, horizontal ocular movements will not occur in a conjugate fashion."
"When there is a lesion of the right MLF, and the individual attempts to gaze to the right, the lesion is not apparent, since both eyes can move simultaneously to the right. However, when attempting to gaze to the left, the right eye cannot move inward  but the left eye, which should move outward  in this lateral gaze, does since it is not affected. If you ask this same individual to look at a near object placed directly in front of him, which necessitates that both eyes adduct , he is able to do so."
"This indicates that:  both oculomotor nerves  are intact; and  the upper motoneurons arising from the motor cortex  are also intact. Therefore, a unilateral lesion of the MLF becomes apparent only during conjugate horizontal eye movement, when gazing away from the side of the lesion. A rare condition referred to as “one-and-a-half” results following a lesion in the vicinity of the abducens nucleus, which involves the entire ipsilateral abducens nucleus as well as the decussating MLF fibers arising from the contralateral abducens nucleus."
"If a lesion is present in the vicinity of the left abducens nucleus the following things happen: 1 The GSE motoneurons, whose axons form the left abducent nerve innervating the left lateral rectus, are damaged. Therefore, the left lateral rectus muscle is paralyzed. 2 The internuclear neurons housed in the left abducens nucleus are also damaged."
"Their crossing fibers  do not, therefore, form excitatory synapses with the motoneurons of the contralateral oculomotor nucleus that innervate the right medial rectus muscle. 3 The crossing fibers of the internuclear neurons arising from the contralateral  abducens nucleus are also damaged; thus they do not form excitatory synapses with the motoneurons of the left oculomotor nucleus that innervate the left medial rectus. Therefore, when attempting to gaze to the left, the left eye will not abduct and the right eye will not adduct during conjugate horizontal gaze to the left."
"When attempting to gaze to the right, the right eye responds normally, that is it is able to abduct, whereas the left eye will not be able to adduct during conjugate horizontal gaze to the right. It is important to note that the innervation to all the extraocular muscles of both eyes is intact, except one—the left lateral rectus. If you ask this individual to look at a near object placed directly in front of him, both eyes will converge, since both medial recti and their innervation  are intact."
"Thus this type of lesion becomes apparent only during conjugate horizontal eye movement. The facial nerve  provides branchiomotor innervation to the muscles of facial expression, the platysma, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, the stylohyoid muscle, and the stapedius muscle. It also transmits taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, as well as parasympathetic  innervation to the lacrimal, submandibular, and sublingual glands."
"Additionally, it provides general sensation to the back of the ear, pinna, and external auditory meatus, as well as visceral sensation from the nasal cavity and the soft palate. The facial nerve consists of two parts: the facial nerve proper and the nervus intermedius. The facial nerve proper is the motor root of the facial nerve consisting of the axons of SVE  neurons whose cell bodies reside in the facial nucleus."
"This nucleus contains subnuclei, each supplying specific muscles or groups of muscles. The nervus intermedius is sometimes referred to as the “sensory root,” which is a misnomer since in addition to sensory fibers it also carries parasympathetic fibers. The nervus intermedius consists of the axons of the GVE  parasympathetic neurons, whose cell bodies reside in the superior salivatory nucleus."
"It also contains the central processes of first order, sensory pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the geniculate  ganglion, the only sensory ganglion of the facial nerve. Some of these pseudounipolar neurons transmit SVA  sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, others convey GSA sensation from the area posterior to the ear, whereas others carry GVA sensation from the nasal cavity and soft palate. Both nerve roots  emerge from the brainstem at the cerebellopontine angle."
"Near their exit from the brainstem, the two roots of the facial nerve accompany one another to the internal acoustic meatus of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and  proceed to the facial canal where the nervus intermedius presents a swelling—the geniculate ganglion. The facial nerve gives rise to three of its branches in the facial canal: the greater petrosal nerve, the nerve to the stapedius muscle , and the chorda tympani nerve. The facial nerve exits the facial canal via the stylomastoid foramen and courses to the parotid bed where its main trunk gives rise to numerous muscular branches, which radiate from within the substance of the gland to innervate their respective muscles ."
"The superior salivatory nucleus contains GVE preganglionic parasympathetic nerve cell bodies  whose axons leave the brainstem via the nervus intermedius. These preganglionic fibers are distributed by the greater petrosal and chorda tympani nerves. The fibers in the greater petrosal nerve subsequently join the nerve of the pterygoid canal to enter the pterygopalatine fossa where they terminate and synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, one of the two parasympathetic ganglia of the facial nerve."
"Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from this ganglion are distributed to the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nasal and oral cavity to provide them with secretomotor innervation. The chorda tympani nerve joins the lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. The chorda tympani carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion , where the fibers synapse with its postganglionic parasympathetic neurons."
"The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from this ganglion course to the submandibular and sublingual glands providing them with secretomotor innervation. The geniculate ganglion houses the cell bodies of the SVA neurons, which are responsible for transmission of taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue . The peripheral processes of these neurons run in the chorda tympani, and reach the tongue via the lingual nerve of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve."
The central processes of the SVA neurons enter the brainstem via the nervus intermedius to join the ipsilateral solitary tract and terminate in the solitary nucleus. Other pseudounipolar neurons of the geniculate ganglion mediate GVA sensation. Their peripheral processes run in the greater petrosal nerve and terminate in the nasal cavity and the soft palate.
"Their central processes course in the nervus intermedius, join the ipsilateral solitary tract, and terminate in the solitary nucleus. Still other pseudounipolar neurons of the geniculate ganglion are responsible for pain, temperature, and touch sensation from the pinna and the external auditory meatus . The peripheral processes of these neurons terminate in the pinna and the external auditory meatus."
"Their central processes course in the nervus intermedius and join the spinal tract of the trigeminal, and terminate to synapse in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. A unilateral lesion of the facial nerve near its root or in the facial canal prior to giving off any of its branches , results in the following conditions ipsilateral to the lesion: damage to the SVE , results in a flaccid paralysis or paresis  of the muscles of facial expression, the platysma, stylohyoid, and posterior belly of the digastric muscles with subsequent muscle atrophy. The stapedius muscle will also be paralyzed and the individual will experience hyperacusis ."
"Usually the stapedius muscle dampens vibrations of the ossicles, but when it is paralyzed, vibrations from the tympanic membrane are transmitted to the ossicles and subsequently to the inner ear receptors for hearing. Furthermore, damage of the SVA fibers relaying taste results in a loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Damage of the GVE parasympathetic fibers causes decreased salivary secretion from the submandibular and sublingual glands."
"Since both parotid glands  and the contralateral sublingual and submandibular glands remain functional, it is difficult to determine from salivary action alone whether there is an interruption of the parasympathetic innervation to the ipsilateral submandibular and sublingual glands. In addition, the efferent limb of the corneal blink reflex will be damaged. Bell’s palsy may be idiopathic, or result following trauma or viral infection of the facial nerve within the facial canal or near its exit from the stylomastoid foramen."
"This condition is characterized by a paresis or paralysis of the muscles of facial expression ipsilateral to the lesion. Bell’s phenomenon is exhibited by individuals with a Bell’s palsy. As the individual attempts to close the eyes, the eye on the affected side deviates up and out."
"A unilateral lesion of the facial nerve proximal to the geniculate ganglion causes loss of tear formation by the ipsilateral lacrimal gland. A condition referred to as “crocodile tear syndrome”  may result as follows. As the preganglionic parasympathetic  fibers originating from the superior salivatory nucleus are regenerating, they may be unsuccessful at finding their way to their intended destination, the submandibular ganglion, and instead take a wrong route to terminate in the pterygopalatine ganglion."
"The fibers then establish inappropriate synaptic contacts with postganglionic  neurons whose fibers project to the lacrimal gland. The vestibulocochlear nerve consists of two distinct and separate nerves enclosed within one connective tissue sheath, the vestibular nerve  and the cochlear nerve . Both nerves transmit SSA information from specialized peripheral ciliated mechanoreceptors ."
"The cell bodies of the sensory first order bipolar neurons of the vestibular nerve reside within the vestibular ganglion of Scarpa . Their peripheral processes terminate in special receptors, the cristae in the ampullae of the semicircular ducts and the maculae of the utricle and saccule, housed within the petrous temporal bone . The central processes of these neurons enter the brainstem to synapse not only in the vestibular nuclear complex, where they synapse with second order neurons of the vestibular pathway, but also in the cerebellum ."
"The vestibular nerve is unique since it is the only cranial nerve that sends the central processes of some of its first order neurons to synapse directly in the cerebellum. The cell bodies of the sensory first order bipolar neurons of the cochlear nerve are housed within the spiral  ganglion . Their peripheral processes terminate and synapse in the organ of Corti, containing the special receptors that transduce sound waves into electric impulses."
"The spiral ganglion and the organ of Corti lie within the cochlea, a snailshell-shaped structure of the inner ear, embedded within the petrous temporal bone . The central processes of these neurons accompany the seventh vestibular nerve to synapse in the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem with second order neurons of the auditory pathway . The glossopharyngeal nerve, one of the smallest cranial nerves, carries five functional components."
"These are:  SVA  and  GVA sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, the adjacent pharyngeal wall, and the carotid sinus ,  GSA sensation from the external ear,  SVE  innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle, and  GVE parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. The glossopharyngeal nerve exits the brainstem as a group of rootlets posterior to the olive in the dorsolateral sulcus. These rootlets immediately collect to form the main trunk of the glossopharyngeal nerve, which shortly exits the cranial vault via the jugular foramen where it presents two swellings, its superior and inferior ganglia ."
"The superior ganglion contains GSA, and the inferior ganglion contains GVA and SVA, cell bodies of first order pseudounipolar neurons. The inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve houses the cell bodies of the SVA  neurons. Their peripheral processes course with the trunk of the glossopharyngeal nerve to the tongue where they supply the posterior one-third of the tongue and adjacent pharyngeal wall with taste sensation."
"The central processes of the SVA neurons pass into the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal nerve root, join the solitary tract and terminate in the solitary nucleus . GVA first order nerve cell bodies reside in the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Their peripheral processes terminate in the mucosa of the posterior one-third of the tongue, tonsil and adjacent pharyngeal wall, tympanic cavity, and auditory tube ."
"Unilateral stimulation of the pharyngeal wall elicits a bilateral contraction of the pharyngeal muscles and soft palate . The glossopharyngeal nerve serves as the afferent limb , whereas the vagus nerve provides the efferent limb of the reflex arc. The central processes of the afferent fibers enter the solitary tract and synapse in the nucleus ambiguus."
"The nucleus ambiguus sends motor fibers via the vagus nerve to the muscles of the palate and pharynx. Many individuals in the general population do not have a gag reflex. Baroreceptor fibers terminate in the carotid body and sinus, which form the afferent limb of the reflex arc that controls blood pressure."
"The central processes of the GVA neurons enter the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal nerve root, join the solitary tract and terminate in the solitary nucleus. The solitary nucleus relays sensory input to the reticular formation, the brainstem GVE  motor nuclei, and the intermediolateral horn  of the spinal cord for reflex activity related to the control of arterial lumen diameter and blood pressure. The glossopharyngeal nerve also provides GSA touch, pain, and temperature innervation to the pinna of the ear and the external auditory meatus."
"The cell bodies of these sensory neurons are located in the superior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The central processes of these neurons course in the glossopharyngeal nerve root, enter the brainstem, and join the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve to terminate and synapse in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Recent clinical evidence supports that fibers transmitting nociceptive sensory input from the pharyngeal wall and posterior one-third of the tongue enter the brainstem and descend in the spinal tract of the trigeminal and terminate in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal."
"Furthermore, sensation from oral structures is transmitted via the glossopharyngeal afferent terminals to the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal. The nucleus ambiguus contains the SVE branchiomotor nerve cell bodies whose axons emerge from the brainstem along with rootlets of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and course with the trunk of the glossopharyngeal nerve . These axons then leave the glossopharyngeal nerve as the nerve to the stylopharyngeus muscle, the only muscle innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve."
"The inferior salivatory nucleus, located in the medulla, contains the GVE cell bodies of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons whose axons exit the brainstem as part of the glossopharyngeal nerve . These fibers then branch off as the tympanic nerve and subsequently spread out to form the tympanic plexus in the tympanic cavity. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers course to the otic ganglion, the parasympathetic ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve , where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons whose fibers join the auriculotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve to reach the parotid gland, providing it with secretomotor innervation."
"A unilateral lesion to the glossopharyngeal nerve near its exit from the brainstem, damaging all of its fibers, will result in damage to the SVA fibers relaying taste sensation and will cause ipsilateral loss of taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue. Damage to the GVE parasympathetic fibers will cause a reduction in salivary secretion of the parotid gland; and damage to the GVA fibers will result in diminished visceral sensation from the pharyngeal mucous membrane, loss of the gag reflex , and loss of the carotid sinus reflex. The stylopharyngeus muscle, which elevates the pharynx during swallowing, will be paralyzed."
"The vagus  nerve  is a large cranial nerve that has the most extensive distribution in the body. Although it is a cranial nerve, its innervation is not limited to the structures in the head, but also extends into the neck, thorax, and abdomen. The vagus nerve carries five functional components:  SVA;  GVA;  GSA;  SVE; and  GVE ."
"A group of fine rootlets surface in the medulla in the dorsolateral sulcus, inferior to the glossopharyngeal nerve and superior to the spinal accessory nerve. The rootlets join to form two distinct bundles—a smaller inferior and a larger superior that collectively form the vagus nerve. The inferior bundle joins the spinal accessory nerve and accompanies it for a short distance, but then the two diverge to go their separate ways."
"The smaller vagal bundle joins the main trunk of the vagus to exit the cranial vault via the jugular foramen. Inferior to the jugular foramen, the vagus nerve displays two swellings, the superior  and inferior  ganglia. The superior ganglion houses the cell bodies of pseudounipolar first order sensory neurons carrying GSA information from the pinna of the ear and external auditory meatus and the dura of the posterior cranial fossa."
"The inferior ganglion contains the pseudounipolar first order nerve cell bodies transmitting GVA sensory innervation from the mucosa of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, and a minor SVA  sensation from the epiglottis. SVA  pseudounipolar neuron cell bodies located in the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve send their peripheral fibers to terminate in the scant taste buds of the epiglottis. Their central processes enter the brainstem along with the other vagal fibers to terminate in the solitary nucleus ."
"GVA pseudounipolar neuron cell bodies housed in the inferior ganglion distribute their peripheral processes in the mucous membranes of the soft palate, and those lining the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and trachea. Chemoreceptor fibers  terminate in the carotid body where they monitor blood carbon dioxide concentration. The central processes of all of the GVA neurons enter the brainstem, course in the solitary tract and terminate in the solitary nucleus ."
"GSA pseudounipolar neuron cell bodies conveying pain, temperature, and touch sensation reside in the superior ganglion and send their peripheral processes to the pinna, external auditory meatus, skin of the ear, and tympanic membrane. Their central processes enter the brainstem, join the spinal tract of the trigeminal and terminate in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal . The cell bodies of the SVE branchiomotor neurons are located in the nucleus ambiguus."
The fibers of these neurons innervate all of the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles with the exception of the stylopharyngeus and the tensor veli palatini muscles . The vagus nerve has a very extensive GVE distribution. It supplies parasympathetic innervation to the laryngeal mucous glands and all of the thoracic and most of the abdominal organs.
The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus houses the nerve cell bodies of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons whose fibers accompany the other vagal fibers upon their exit from the brainstem. These fibers run in the main trunk of the vagus into the thorax where they leave the main trunk and join the autonomic plexuses scattered throughout the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The preganglionic fibers terminate and synapse in the terminal parasympathetic ganglia or ganglia near or within the viscera.
"Parasympathetic innervation decreases the heart rate , reduces adrenal gland secretion, activates peristalsis, and stimulates glandular activity of various organs . Unilateral damage of the vagus nerve near its emergence from the brainstem results in a number of deficiencies on the ipsilateral side. Damage to the SVE branchiomotor fibers will cause flaccid paralysis or weakness of:  the pharyngeal muscles and levator veli palatini of the soft palate, resulting in dysphagia ;  the laryngeal muscles, resulting in dysphonia  and dyspnea ; and  loss of the gag reflex ."
"Damage to the GVA fibers will cause loss of general sensation from the soft palate, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and trachea. Damage to the GVE fibers will cause cardiac arrhythmias. A bilateral lesion of the vagus nerve is incompatible with life, due to the interruption of parasympathetic innervation to the heart."
"The spinal accessory nerve  supplies motor innervation to the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and many of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. In the early literature this nerve was described as consisting of two distinct parts: a cranial  and a spinal root. It is now understood that the “cranial root” of the accessory nerve is composed of aberrant vagal fibers arising from the nucleus ambiguus in the medulla."
"These vagal fibers collectively form a distinct root as they emerge from the brainstem. On the other hand, the spinal accessory nerve derives its fibers from the spinal accessory nucleus residing in the posterolateral aspect of the ventral horns of cervical spinal cord levels C2–C5 . This nucleus is continuous superiorly with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla."
"Delicate rootlets emerging from the surface of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord  converge and assemble to form the spinal accessory nerve. This nerve trunk ascends, enters the cranial vault through the foramen magnum, and proceeds on the lateral aspect of the medulla to join the aberrant vagal fibers as they emerge from the medulla. The two groups of fibers accompany one another for a short distance but then diverge to go their separate ways."
The aberrant vagal fibers join the main trunk of the vagus nerve and follow those fibers of the vagus that are destined to supply most of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. The spinal accessory nerve exits the cranial vault via the jugular foramen. It courses inferiorly to the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle providing it with motor innervation.
"It continues its inferior course to the posterior triangle of the neck and then proceeds to the deep aspect of the upper part of the trapezius muscle to supply it with motor innervation. In view of its origin, many neuroanatomists no longer consider the accessory nerve to be a true cranial nerve, but instead a unique type of spinal nerve. Additionally, there are differences of opinion relating to the classification of the functional components of the spinal accessory nerve."
"Some authors consider that this nerve carries branchiomotor SVE fibers since neurons of the spinal accessory nucleus develop in a manner characteristic of SVE, not GSE, neurons; whereas others believe that they are somatomotor, that is GSE. Recent literature supports that GSA proprioceptive fibers are carried by the spinal accessory nerve from the upper cervical spinal cord levels to the structures it innervates, but questions the branchial arch origins of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. A unilateral lesion confined to the spinal accessory nucleus or the nerve proximal to its muscular distribution results in an ipsilateral flaccid paralysis and subsequent atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid and upper part of the trapezius muscles."
"An individual with such a lesion is unable to turn his or her head away from the lesion. Normally, unilateral contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle draws the mastoid process inferiorly, bending the head sideways , which is accompanied by an upward turning of the chin towards the opposite side. If the upper part of the trapezius is paralyzed, the upper border of the scapula is rotated laterally and inferiorly with its inferior angle pointing towards the spine."
"This results in slight drooping of the ipsilateral shoulder, accompanied by a weakening of the shoulder when attempting to raise it. The hypoglossal nerve  provides motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue. The cell bodies of the GSE lower motoneurons of the hypoglossal nerve reside in the hypoglossal nucleus, a cell column in the medulla."
"This nucleus, located ventral to the floor of the fourth ventricle near the midline, forms a triangular elevation—the hypoglossal trigone—in the floor of the midline of the ventricle. The nerve cell bodies of the hypoglossal nucleus give rise to axons that course ventrally to arise as a series of tiny rootlets on the ventral surface of the medulla in the sulcus separating the pyramid and the olive. These rootlets collect to form the hypoglossal nerve, which exits the cranial vault through the hypoglossal foramen."
The nerve then courses to the submandibular region to serve the ipsilateral side of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve innervates the intrinsic muscles  and all the extrinsic muscles of the tongue  with the exception of the palatoglossus. Recent studies indicate that GSA fibers terminating in muscle spindles of the tongue musculature transmit proprioceptive sensation to the trigeminal system involved in reflex activity of mastication.
"Some investigators believe that the cell bodies of these GSA pseudounipolar neurons are located in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, whereas others maintain that they are dispersed along the hypoglossal nerve. A lesion in the hypoglossal nucleus or nerve results in flaccid paralysis and subsequent atrophy of the ipsilateral tongue musculature. Hemiparalysis of the tongue causes creasing  of the dorsal surface of the tongue ipsilateral to the lesion."
"Normally, the simultaneous contraction of the paired genioglossi muscles causes the tongue to protrude straightforward. During examination of the patient it is important to remember that a unilateral lesion of the hypoglossal nerve will cause the tongue to deviate towards the side of the lesion  since the functional genioglossus on the intact side is unopposed by the paralyzed, inactive genioglossus on the lesion side. This patient has trigeminal neuralgia, also called tic douloureux."
"This is a purely clinical diagnosis, and tests are usually normal. This is a very common disorder, and this is a typical presentation. The pain is indeed excruciating and should be taken very seriously, as suicide is not an uncommon result! This condition is most common in the elderly, though it can occur in younger age groups."
"The common etiology is thought to be from ephaptic transmission of nerve impulses, or in other words “short circuiting. ” The most common cause is from vascular “loops” that develop and surround one of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve at its root, most commonly affecting the ophthalmic and sometimes the maxillary divisions. This causes compression of the nerve, demyelination, and ephaptic transmission."
"This condition is usually spontaneous and comes “out of the blue. ” Trigeminal neuralgia in a young person brings up the specter of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, and can be a cause of trigeminal neuralgia."
"This is thought to result from demyelination of the trigeminal nerve root as it enters the brainstem. There are effective treatments for this condition. Carbamazepine, an antiseizure medication, is the most effective."
"Other antiseizure medications have been used. Trigeminal neuralgia from vascular loops can be treated, if refractory to medications, by microvascular decompression surgery. This surgical procedure generated much skepticism when it was first introduced, but has produced excellent results for refractory cases and has now become widely accepted."
"A 32-year-old woman describes visual loss in the right eye. She first noticed its onset a week ago, and since then it has become progressively worse over the course of 2 days. She can no longer see with her right eye."
The left eye is normal. There is also some pain in the right eye when she moves her eyes. She has never had eye or visual problems prior to this episode.
"She otherwise has no complaints, her health has always been perfect, and she has never had any neurologic symptoms in the past. An ophthalmology exam shows visual acuity of 20/20 on the left, while on the right she is not able to read the largest numbers on the number chart but is able to count fingers that are presented to her. Pupillary constriction to light in the left is normal, while reaction on the right is present but seems less brisk."
"Funduscopic exam shows papilledema  of the right optic disc while the left is normal. Eye movements are intact, although the patient complains of some pain on movement of the right eye. The rest of the neurologic exam is normal."
"The visual system is one of the most important of all the sensory  systems in humans since it transmits an extraordinary amount of information perceived about our environment to higher brain centers. The eyes are intricate sensory organs that mediate the special sense of sight. They resemble two autofocusing cameras, each consisting of a lens that not only allows the passage of, but also focuses, light reflected from objects on the retina."
"The retina contains photosensitive cells, rods and cones, which transmit sensory input related to color, light intensity, and form reflected from objects to other cells of the retina. This sensory input is further processed, and visual information is conveyed by other retinal cells to higher brain centers, where a visual image is formed. Although the bulb of the eye consists of three concentric layers, each layer is not present throughout the entire wall of the eye."
"The three layers are an external  fibrous layer, a middle layer, and an internal  layer. From posterior to anterior, the outer layer is composed of the sclera and cornea; the middle layer includes the choroid, ciliary body, and iris; whereas the inner layer is formed by the retina . The posterior five-sixths of the external layer is a tough, opaque, white collagenous connective tissue, the sclera , which forms a protective rigid layer for the bulb of the eye."
"The anterior one-sixth of the outer layer is modified as the cornea, a transparent avascular region that bulges anteriorly. The cornea not only permits light to pass through to enter the eye, but it also refracts it. The region of the sclera, surrounding the cornea, is apparent as the “white of the eye."
"” Posteriorly, the sclera permits the optic nerve to pass through its fenestrated region, the lamina cribrosa. The middle layer appears dark, due to the presence of melanin pigments in its cells. Since it resembles the skin of a dark grape, it is called the uvea ."
"The posterior aspect of the middle layer, known as the choroid, is the vascular coat of the eye. The choroid not only has an important nutritive function for the retina, but its pigmented cells absorb excess light that has passed through the retina, reducing light reflection and glare inside the bulb. At its anterior margin, the choroid merges with a thickened structure, the ciliary body and its processes, at the ora serrata."
"The ora serrata is the serrated margin between the choroid and the ciliary body. The ciliary body houses the ciliary muscle, a smooth muscle, that changes the shape of the lens for accommodation. The ciliary body is continuous anteriorly with the iris, a pigmented diaphragm that encircles a space known as the pupil."
"The iris overlaps the anterior surface of the lens, and its color is visible through the transparent cornea. Smooth muscle activity in the iris results in the constriction or dilation of the pupil, controlling the amount of light that may enter the eye. The diaphragm-like opening and closing of the iris is controlled by two smooth muscles, the sphincter pupillae, innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system whose contraction constricts the pupil, and the dilatator pupillae, innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, and whose contraction dilates the pupil."
"The delicate internal layer of the eye is the retina. It is composed of an outer layer, the pigment epithelium which underlies the choroid, and an inner layer, the retina proper or neural retina . The pigment epithelium consists of a layer of pigmented cells that absorb light that has passed through the retina."
"The neural retina contains the layers of nerve cells responsible for the processing and transmission of visual information. The photosensitive portion of the neural retina extends from the ora serrata to the optic disc. The nonphotosensitive portion of the retina extends from the ora serrata anteriorly, where it lines the inner surface of the ciliary body and iris."
"The elements of the optic nerve collect into a bundle at the optic disc and pierce all the three layers of the bulb to exit the eye . The optic disc is insensitive to light  resulting in a blind spot in the visual field. The macula lutea  is a yellow spot of the retina in the back of the eye, whose central pit, the fovea centralis, contains only cones and represents the site of maximal visual acuity and color perception."
"The neural retina is a multilayered structure. These layers contain supporting glia  and astrocytes, as well as six types of neurons that process visual input prior to its transmission to the diencephalon. They are the photoreceptors , the conducting neurons , and the association neurons or interneurons , which modulate the activity of the bipolar and ganglion cells."
The retina consists of the following 10 layers . 1 Pigment epithelium. The deepest layer of the retina consists of pigmented cells.
"This is a non-neural layer that absorbs excess light which has passed through the other retinal layers, and is immediately next to the choroid. 2 Rod and cone layer. This layer includes the outer and inner segments of the photoreceptor cells ."
"The discs of the photoreceptors contain visual pigments that undergo chemical changes  leading to the initiation of local receptor potentials. 3 External  limiting membrane. Although this appears to be a membrane, actually its not."
It is formed by intercellular junctions—the zonulae adherents— binding the apical aspect of the Müller cells. 4 Outer nuclear layer. This consists of the cell bodies of the rods and cones.
"5 Outer plexiform layer. This is a synaptic area that contains the terminals of the rods and cones, as well as those of the retinal interneurons  and bipolar cells. The rods and cones synapse with the horizontal and bipolar cells."
"The horizontal cells join the photoreceptor cells laterally. 6 Inner nuclear layer. This consists of the somata of the retinal interneurons , which integrate and modulate the activity of the photoreceptors."
"7 Inner plexiform layer. This is a synaptic area containing the terminals of the bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. Amacrine cells link the ganglion cells laterally."
8 Ganglion cell layer. This consists of the somata of the ganglion cells . 9 Optic nerve fiber layer.
"This is composed of the axons of the ganglion cells that gather to form a thick bundle, the optic nerve. These axons terminate primarily in the lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus. 10 Internal  limiting membrane."
"This membrane is composed of a basal lamina interposed between the vitreous body and the Müller cells. The vitreous body is a gelatinous substance filling the vitreous space of the bulb of the eye, posterior to the lens. The internal limiting membrane separates the neural retina from the vitreous body."
"Sensory input from the photoreceptors is transmitted to a synaptic zone stimulating bipolar cells, which in turn transmit the information to ganglion cells. Horizontal and amacrine cells link the conducting neurons laterally within the retina. The convergent circuitry of the rods on the bipolar cells results in a decrease in visual acuity."
"High acuity would result from a 1 : 1 ratio of rods to bipolar cells: one tiny portion of the visual field would be mapped to one bipolar cell. Instead, many rods representing a larger portion of the visual field are mapped to one bipolar cell, so that cell represents a larger portion of the visual field. There is little convergence in the macula lutea of the retina, the site of highest visual acuity."
The supporting Müller cells  extend the entire thickness of the retina from the internal to the external limiting membrane. The cones  are activated by high intensity light . They mediate sharp vision and color vision.
"They detect fine detail, have the highest acuity, and are more numerous in the central portion of the retina and less concentrated at the periphery. There are three different types of cones in the human retina, the membrane of each cone being associated with a different pigment, and responding to a different wavelength of light . Rods are of a single type only ."
"They are stimulated by low intensity light; thus they transmit visual input in dim illumination  but they cannot detect colors. They are more concentrated in peripheral regions of the retina. At night, when looking straight at a light located at a distance, it disappears when projected on the fovea , but when looking away from it, the image falls on more peripheral regions of the retina, where rods are more numerous, and therefore the image becomes visible."
"Rods and cones are composed of an inner segment, a connecting stalk, and an outer segment. The inner segment encloses the cellular organelles and is the site of protein synthesis, such as the protein component of the photopigments. The connecting stalk is the narrow segment interposed between the inner and outer segments."
"The photoreceptor cells derive their name from the morphology of their outer segment—that of a rod being cylindrical, and that of a cone being conical. The outer segment is the dendritic end of the photoreceptor and is a photosensitive-modified cilium, which is located adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium. The photoreceptor outer segment consists of a stack of horizontally oriented, membranous, flattened discs derived from the plasma membrane."
"In rods, the hollow discs located at the apical end of the outer segment are intracellular, and are completely separated from the plasma membrane. The discs located closer to the base of the rod outer segment, and the entire outer segment of the cones, consist of shelf-like infoldings of the plasma membrane. They are thus a continuation of the plasma membrance with their interior being continuous with the intercellular space ."
"A light-absorbing photopigment is synthesized in the inner segments of both rods and cones, and is then transported to their respective outer segments , where it is incorporated into disc membranes as transmembrane proteins. The membrane of rods is associated with the pigment rhodopsin , whereas the membrane of cones is associated with a pigment that consists of a component chemical of iodopsin. Rhodopsin and iodopsin are almost identical chemically, with the exception of their spectral sensitivity difference ."
"Both rhodopsin and iodopsin consist of two components: an opsin, which is a protein moiety, and a chromophore , which absorbs photons. In rods the opsin is known as scotopsin , whereas in cones the opsins are known as photopsins . The chromophore associated with rods is retinal, a substance derived from vitamin A."
"Normal vision is dependent on a sufficient intake of vitamin A. A severe dietary deficiency of vitamin A results in night blindness, a condition characterized by the inability to see in poor illumination. Rhodopsin is a transmembrane homologue of G-proteinlinked receptor molecules that acts by activating a trimeric G-protein ."
"It is composed of a protein segment, opsin , to which a vitamin A derivative, 11-cis-retinal, is covalently attached. The plasma membrane of the rod outer segment contains cGMP-gated Na+ channels to which cGMP is bound in the absence of light. The cGMP–Na+ channel complex maintains the channel in an open state, so that Na+ as well Ca+ can enter the outer segment."
"The constant flow of Na+ ions into the outer segment causes a high rate of neurotransmitter release from the synaptic region of the rod, resulting in the inhibition of postsynaptic retinal neurons in the dark. When a photon hits the 11-cis-retinal molecule, it isomerizes to all-trans-retinal, and this change in molecular configuration causes an alteration in the conformation of the opsin to which it is attached. This conformational change of the opsin moiety results in the binding of rhodopsin to transducin which, in turn, dissociates and its alpha subunit activates the enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase."
"Since this enzyme functions to hydrolyze cGMP, decreasing its cytosolic concentration, cGMP is released from the Na+ channels causing the closure of these channels. The lack of Na+ flow into the outer segment causes a hyperpolarization of the rod with a resultant shutdown of neurotransmitter release from its synaptic region. Since the neurotransmitter substance inhibits the postsynaptic retinal neurons, the absence of the neurotransmitter acts to excite them."
"Thus a single photon has the capability of eliciting a visual response. The closed state of the Na+ channel also shuts off the flow of Ca+ into the outer segment of the rod. This decrease in cytosolic Ca+ causes the uncoupling of Ca+ from the cytosolic protein recoverin, resulting in its activation."
"The activated recoverin stimulates guanylyl cyclase to manufacture cGMP which, by binding to the guanylyl cyclase, opens the Na+ channels so that the rod can revert to its dark-phase  state. The human eye consists of two “lenses,” the cornea and the lens . Light rays entering the eye are actually refracted mostly by the cornea, and not the lens."
"The lens is a biconvex, transparent adjustable structure, whose shape can be adjusted in order to focus the corneal image on the retina. The lens is suspended posterior to the iris by the suspensory ligaments of the lens, which are anchored to the ciliary processes of the ciliary body. The lens inverts and reverses the image and focuses it on the retina."
"In order for incoming light to reach the retina, it has to pass through the following refractive media of the eye: 1 The cornea. This is the chief refracting medium of the eye. It serves to focus a crude image on the retina."
2 The anterior chamber of the eye. This is a fluid-filled  space between the lens and the cornea. 3 The lens.
"The shape  of the lens can be altered, which can fine focus the corneal image on the retina. 4 The vitreous body. This is a transparent gelatinous substance filling the vitreous space of the bulb of the eye, posterior to the lens."
"5 Most layers of the neural retina. In order for light to reach the photoreceptors , which are located at the “back” of the retina, light has to first go through the overlying retinal layers  in order to reach them. Incoming light rays impinging on the retina pass from its inner layers to its outermost neural layer where they cause the retinal photoreceptor cells , the rods and cones, to become hyperpolarized."
"The photoreceptors then stop releasing neurotransmitters and the bipolar cells  are no longer inhibited, and fire. The bipolar cells along with the interneurons, the horizontal and amacrine cells, process, integrate, and modulate visual input. The bipolar cells relay this sensory input to the ganglion cells  of the retina."
"Therefore, stimulation within the retina proceeds from the rod and cone layer to the bipolar cell layer and finally to the ganglion cell layer. Although light travels from the inner to the outer layers of the retina, visual electrical signals are transmitted in the opposite direction from the outer to the inner layers of the retina. The ganglion cells possess nonmyelinated axons  that course on the inner surface of the retina , converge at the optic disc, and cross a sieve-like perforated area of the sclera, the lamina cribrosa, to emerge from the back of the bulb of the eye."
"At this point, the axons become myelinated and they form a large bundle, the optic nerve . The optic nerve is enveloped in a meningeal cover, exits the bony orbit by passing through the optic canal, and enters the middle cranial fossa. The optic nerves of the right and left sides join superior to the body of the sphenoid bone in the middle cranial fossa to form an intersection of fibers, the optic chiasma   where partial decussation of the optic nerve fibers  of the two sides occurs."
"All ganglion cell axons arising from the temporal half of the retina course in the lateral aspect of the optic chiasma without decussating, to join the optic tract of the same side. All ganglion cell axons arising from the nasal half of the retina decussate at the optic chiasma, and enter the optic tract of the opposite side, to join the temporal fibers. Thus, each optic tract consists of ganglion cell axons arising from both eyes ."
"The fibers retain a retinotopic organization in the optic tract as it courses around the cerebral peduncle to end and relay visual information primarily in the lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus, which processes visual input. The optic nerve also ends and relays visual information in:  the superior colliculus, a mesencephalic relay nucleus for vision having an important function in somatic motor reflexes;  the pretectal area, which mediates autonomic reflexes such as the control of pupillary constriction and lens accommodation ; and  the hypothalamus, which has an important function in circadian rhythms  and the reproductive cycle . An overview of the central visual pathway is given in ."
The lateral geniculate nucleus  is a relay station of the dorsal thalamus whose principal function is to process and regulate the flow of visual information and relay it to the primary visual cortex. The LGN houses the cell bodies of third order neurons of the visual pathway. Their axons form the thalamocortical projection  that relays visual input to the primary visual cortex.
"The LGN is a laminated structure consisting of six distinct layers that are readily identifiable in a horizontal section. Although each LGN receives information from the contralateral visual hemifield, each of its layers receives input from only one eye. Layers 1, 4, and 6 receive ganglion cell axons arising from the contralateral retina, whereas layers 2, 3, and 5 receive ganglion cell axons arising from the ipsilateral retina."
Layers 1 and 2 consist of large neurons and are therefore referred to as the magnocellular layers; they receive information from ganglion cells that are sensitive to movement and contrast but are insensitive to color. Layers 3–6 consist of small neurons and are referred to as the parvocellular layers; they receive information from the ganglion cells responding to color and form. The macular area of the retina has a greater representation in the LGN than the peripheral  areas of the retina.
"Furthermore, the lateral half of the LGN receives visual information from the lower retinal quadrants , whereas its medial half receives visual information from the upper retinal quadrants . In addition to the retinal ganglion cell axon terminals  arriving at the LGN , the LGN also receives a greater number of afferents from the visual cortical areas . These fibers are associated with stimulating visual attention of the individual, and reciprocally regulating the transmission of sensory input from the LGN to the primary visual cortex."
"The superior colliculi   are two prominent elevations projecting from the posterior surface of the mesencephalon. They are also laminated structures, each consisting of seven layers. The superior colliculus is a relay nucleus of the mesencephalon that receives sensory input  from: • the visual system to layers 1–3 ; • the auditory system to layers 4–7 ; and • the somatosensory system to layers 4–7 ."
"Following the integration of all the sensory input, appropriate reflex responses are produced by the neurons of the superior colliculi. The superior colliculus has important functions in the control of reflex movements that orient the eyes, head, and neck in response to visual, auditory, and somatic stimuli  via its outputs . Efferents from the superior colliculus include projections to the reticular formation, the inferior colliculus, the LGN and the pulvinar of the thalamus, the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei via the medial longitudinal fasciculus , the pontine nuclei and the cerebellum via he tectopontocerebellar tract, and the cervical levels of the spinal cord via the crossed tectospinal tract."
"The fibers of the geniculocalcarine tract follow the contour of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle , joining the retrolenticular and sublenticular components of the internal capsule, the corona radiata, and then pass posteriorly toward the medial and posterior surface of the occipital lobe where the visual cortex is located. Each one of the axons of the geniculocalcarine tract carries visual input only from one eye. The geniculocalcarine tract fibers maintain retinotopic organization and form an upper, an intermediate, and a lower division."
The upper division consists of fibers conveying information from the superior retinal quadrants. This division projects via the retrolenticular portion of the internal capsule to the superior bank of the calcarine fissure of the primary visual cortex. The lower division consists of fibers conveying information from the inferior retinal quadrants.
The lower division fibers collectively form Meyer’s loop . These fibers loop anteriorly and inferiorly around the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle then posteriorly via the sublenticular part of the internal capsule to the inferior bank of the calcarine fissure of the primary visual cortex. The intermediate division of the geniculocalcarine tract consists of fibers relaying visual information to the primary visual cortex from the macular region of the retina .
"The neurons of the visual cortex respond to different visual stimuli transmitted by neurons conveying color, motion, three-dimensional vision, or a combination of various visual stimuli. The LGN projects visual information to the primary visual cortex  . The primary visual cortex projects to the secondary visual cortex , where information is processed and subsequently relayed to the tertiary visual areas  of the cortex."
"The tertiary visual areas function in identifying an object as well as in determining its location and color. Furthermore, the middle temporal area has an important function in detecting moving objects. The primary visual cortex resides mainly in the medial surfaces of the occipital lobes on the banks of the calcarine fissure, although it extends into their posteromedial surface."
"The primary visual cortex is also referred to as the striate cortex due to its striped characteristic exhibiting a noticeable band of myelinated fibers, the “stripe of Gennari. ” The primary visual cortex receives visual input from the macula of the retina in its caudal third, and from the paramacular  fields of the retina in its rostral portions. The macular representation in the primary visual cortex is much larger than that of other areas of the retina, reflecting the high visual acuity of the macula."
"Inherent in the structure of the visual system is its ability to adapt to environmental changes such as varying light intensity, in order to protect the eye and to facilitate vision. The pupillary light reflex is an autonomic response; it is mediated independently of cortical input. The iris contains two smooth muscles, the sphincter pupillae and dilatator pupillae, which control the diameter of the pupil."
"When the circularly arranged fibers of the sphincter pupillae contract the diameter of the pupil is decreased, therefore reducing the amount of light that falls on the retina. The fibers of the dilatator pupillae muscle are arranged radially, and when they contract the pupillary aperture dilates, allowing more light to enter the eye to reach the retina. The size of the pupillary aperture depends on two factors:  the tone of the autonomic nervous system—if the activity of the sympathetic nervous system dominates, the pupillary aperture dilates; if the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, the pupillary aperture constricts; and  the amount of light that reaches the retina—varying the light intensity results in a corresponding alteration of pupillary size."
"Normally, bright light causes the pupils to constrict, whereas dim light causes the pupils to dilate. The pupillary light reflex of an individual may be tested by illuminating one eye with a small flashlight and observing that normally, simultaneous pupillary constriction results in both eyes. The reaction in the illuminated eye is the direct pupillary light reflex, whereas the reaction in the nonilluminated eye is the consensual pupillary light reflex."
The pupillary light reflex pathway is summarized in Fig. 16. 10.
"Bright light stimulating the photosensitive retina is transmitted via the optic nerve, optic chiasma, optic tract and  the brachium of the superior colliculus  to the pretectal area located in the cranial aspect of the mesencephalon . The pretectal area sends bilateral projections to the Edinger–Westphal nuclei of the oculomotor nuclear complex. Each Edinger–Westphal nucleus   projects via the oculomotor nerve to the ipsilateral ciliary ganglion  synapsing with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons housed in this ganglion."
"The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers project via the short ciliary branches of the trigeminal nerve to the ipsilateral sphincter pupillae muscle, causing it to contract. This results in bilateral pupillary constriction, with a consequent reduction in the amount of light reaching the retina of both eyes. Pupillary dilation is mediated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system."
"Pupillary dilation occurs when sympathetic activity is dominant, such as when the individual is experiencing pain, fear, or rage. Neurons of the posterior aspect of the hypothalamus project to the ciliospinal center of the spinal cord located in the intermediolateral cell column of cord levels  T1–T2 . Here they synapse with preganglionic sympathetic neurons."
"Preganglionic sympathetic fibers exit the spinal cord, enter the sympathetic trunk and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers form the internal carotid arterial perivascular plexus and follow vessel branches to the orbit where they join the long and short ciliary branches of the trigeminal nerve and terminate in the dilatator pupillae muscle. Sympathetic innervation of this muscle causes it to contract, increasing the pupillary diameter, resulting in mydriasis ."
"As visual attention is consciously switched from a far away object to one near by, the thickness of the lens of each eye changes from a flatter to a more rounded, biconvex shape in order to be able to project a focused image on the retina. This is accomplished by an initial conscious fixation on the near object, followed by the subconscious convergence accommodation reflex, consisting of three reflex changes . 1 Convergence."
"As attention is shifted from a far to a near object, both eyes converge simultaneously. This is mediated by bilateral contraction of the medial recti muscles, which are innervated by the medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nerve . This convergence permits the visual image to be projected and focused on the foveae of both retinas."
"If this is not accomplished, the individual will experience diplopia . Unlike other reflexes, this reflex involves the cerebral cortex. 2 Accommodation."
"Parasympathetic stimulation causes contraction of the ciliary muscle of the iris thus releasing the tension it exerts on the suspensory ligaments of the lens. Since the lens is no longer being stretched, it thickens , focusing the image on the retina. 3 Pupillary constriction."
Pupillary constriction enhances the outline of the image formed on the retina. This is a distinct and independent process from that which occurs in the pupillary light reflex. Visual input is transmitted from the retina to the primary visual cortex  via the visual pathway.
"The primary visual cortex transmits the information to the visual association cortex  where reflex activity is initiated. Fibers from this area form the corticotectal tract , which projects bilaterally to the superior colliculus and/or the pretectal area. These areas then project to Perlia’s nucleus of the oculomotor nuclear complex, which in turn project to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus and the medial rectus subnucleus ."
"Motor fibers from the medial rectus subnucleus and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the Edinger–Westphal nucleus join the oculomotor nerve  to distribute to the medial rectus muscle and the ciliary ganglion, respectively. The medial recti muscles adduct the eyes . Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers arising from the ciliary ganglion join the short ciliary nerves of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to distribute to the sphincter pupillae muscle and to the ciliary muscle."
"Contraction of the sphincter pupillae muscle results in pupillary constriction , whereas contraction of the ciliary muscle results in thickening of the lens  . The corneal blink reflex consists of : • receptors ; • an afferent limb ; • an integrator ; • an efferent limb ; and • an effector . When a fine strand of cotton or any other foreign object is brushed against the cornea unilaterally, it evokes an immediate, forceful blinking of both eyes simultaneously."
"General somatic afferent  sensation from the cornea is transmitted by the receptors at the peripheral processes of first order pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the trigeminal ganglion. These peripheral processes course in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve . The central processes of most of these neurons enter the pons, join the ipsilateral spinal trigeminal tract and descend to terminate in the rostral two-thirds of the ipsilateral spinal trigeminal nucleus where they synapse with second order neurons ."
"The remainder of the first order neurons terminate in the ipsilateral main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Second order neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus as well as from the main sensory nucleus project bilaterally to the motor nucleus of the facial nerve where they synapse with motoneurons . Fibers of the motoneurons course in the facial nerve to terminate in and innervate the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing bilateral blinking ."
"The visual field, the region perceived by each eye, is divided by imaginary lines into quadrants . Since light rays travel in straight lines, the temporal half of the visual field is projected onto the nasal half of the retina, whereas the nasal half of the visual field is projected onto the temporal half of the retina. The image within the visual field quadrants is reversed and inverted by the lens when it is projected on the respective retina."
The naming of visual deficits is based on the visual field loss and not the actual impaired or damaged region of the retina or other visual system component . Anopsia   refers to visual field loss. Hemianopsia  is the loss of only one-half  of the visual field of one or both eyes .
"Quadrantanopsia  is the loss of one-fourth  of the visual field of one or both eyes. A deficit may be homonymous  or heteronymous  . In a homonymous deficit, the visual field losses for the two eyes are the same."
"That is, there is a right or left visual field loss for both eyes. In a heteronymous deficit, the visual field losses for the two eyes are not alike. That is, there is a right visual field loss in one eye, and a left visual field loss in the contralateral eye, or vice versa."
A unilateral lesion of the optic nerve results in permanent blindness in the ipsilateral  eye . Unilateral damage to the temporal  fibers of the optic chiasma results in an ipsilateral nasal hemianopsia . The noncrossing fibers are often damaged by an aneurysm and/or calcification of the internal carotid artery due to its close proximity to the fibers.
Bilateral damage to the temporal fibers of the optic chiasma results in a binasal heteronymous hemianopsia . A lesion that damages the crossed fibers occupying the central region of the optic chiasma results in a bitemporal heteronymous  hemianopsia  . The central fibers may be damaged due to compression by a tumor of the pituitary gland.
"A unilateral lesion caudal to the optic chiasma, affecting the optic tract fibers or the lateral geniculate nucleus, results in a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia . A unilateral lesion affecting Myer’s loop or the lower division of the optic radiations, results in a contralateral upper homonymous quadrantanopsia . A lesion affecting the fibers of the upper division of the geniculocalcarine tract  results in a contralateral lower homonymous quadrantanopia ."
"A unilateral lesion that damages the upper and lower divisions of the geniculocalcarine tract or produces injury to the ipsilateral primary visual cortex  will result in a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing . Macular sparing occurs because so much cortex is devoted to the macula that often some central vision is spared. If one of the optic nerves  is damaged, and light is flashed into the eye ipsilateral to the damaged nerve, both direct and consensual pupillary responses will not be present since sensory input is not transmitted centrally."
"When the light is flashed into the eye on the side of the undamaged optic nerve, both the direct and the consensual pupillary responses will be elicited, if both oculomotor nerves are functional. If the optic nerve is functional bilaterally, but there is unilateral damage to the oculomotor nerve , light flashed into either eye is perceived by the individual and sensory input is transmitted centrally. When light is flashed into the eye ipsilateral to the oculomotor nerve lesion there is only a consensual pupillary response."
"When light is flashed into the eye contralateral to the oculomotor nerve lesion, there is only a direct pupillary response. If both oculomotor nerves are damaged and parasympathetic innervation to the sphincter pupillae muscles is interrupted bilaterally, then neither eye will exhibit the direct or consensual responses. An individual may be blind, but present a normal pupillary light reflex ."
"This indicates that the site of the lesion producing the blindness involves structures caudal  to the divergence of the optic tract fibers . The lesion may involve the LGN, or the optic radiations, or the primary visual cortex. If the individual is completely blind, a bilateral lesion of the visual cortex is more probable since an extensive, bilateral lesion of the geniculocalcarine tract is incompatible with life."
"A lesion that damages the sympathetic  fibers of this pathway, results in Horner’s syndrome ipsilateral to the lesion. One of the characteristics of this syndrome is a persistent miosis  ipsilateral to the lesion due to the unopposed action of the parasympathetic nervous system. Although an individual with Horner’s syndrome exhibits loss of the pupillary dilation reflex, the pupillary constriction reflex is intact, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion."
"If there is a lesion in the ophthalmic nerve  of the corneal blink reflex arc, corneal sensation is lost on the ipsilateral side, and the corneal blink reflex is not elicited on either side upon stimulation of the cornea ipsilateral to the lesion. If the cornea ipsilateral to the intact ophthalmic nerve is stimulated, it evokes bilateral simultaneous blinking. If the ophthalmic nerve  of the corneal blink reflex arc is intact bilaterally, but there is a unilateral lesion of the facial nerve , both corneas can sense stimulation when either one is stimulated."
"However, only the eye ipsilateral to the intact facial nerve will blink. This patient has optic neuritis. This refers to inflammation of the optic nerve arising from any cause."
"However, it most commonly occurs in multiple sclerosis  or another demyelinating disease. Not all patients with optic neuritis have or will ever develop MS, but most do. Therefore optic neuritis typically refers to demyelination of the optic nerves."
"MS affects only the central nervous system. Although almost all of the cranial nerves are components of the peripheral nervous system, the optic nerves are unusual since they are actually tracts and thus components of the central nervous system. This case is a typical presentation of optic neuritis, i."
"e. , visual loss affecting one eye  and sometimes with pain on eye movement and papilledema. Papilledema refers to swelling of the optic disc as seen on ophthalmoscopic exam."
"This may or may not be present, depending on the part of the optic nerve that is affected. If visual acuity is severely impaired then the pupil of the affected eye will not constrict to light properly, i. e."
", less than the unaffected eye. This can result in a Marcus Gunn pupil, as determined in the swinging light test. The examiner shines a penlight into each eye in succession."
"When the light is directed in the normal eye, both pupils constrict. When it is swung to the affected eye, the pupil paradoxically dilates . This is referred to as an afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye."
Optic neuritis is treated by intravenous corticosteroids over 3–5 days. The majority of cases resolve completely or nearly so over the course of weeks or months. An MRI of the optic nerves may reveal the inflammation.
"However, an MRI is used mainly in the detection of any other brain lesion that may be indicative of MS. Visually evoked potentials can also be used to detect subclinical abnormality of the optic nerves to confirm the presence of MS in suspected cases. A 49-year-old woman complains of right-sided hearing loss which began a year ago."
This has slowly and progressively become worse. Hearing from the left ear is normal. She first noticed this when it became difficult to hear with the phone held to her right ear.
She has also noted vague and persistent imbalance and dizziness over the past couple months. There is some ringing in her right ear. The patient has no other complaints.
Examination reveals mild hearing loss and difficulty distinguishing different sounds on the right. The appearance of the external auditory canal and eardrum is normal. Gait examination reveals mild ataxia when attempting to walk in a straight line.
"The rest of the neurologic exam is normal. The special sense of hearing is mediated by the cochlear nerve, the cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve , that innervates a specialized receptor organ, the organ of Corti enclosed in the cochlea , a bony structure located in the inner ear within the petrous portion of the temporal bone . Originally, the principal function of the inner ear was the maintenance of equilibrium , but the phylogenetically older vestibular apparatus  developed a special receptor for sound perception."
"The ear is divisible into three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear, each performing a necessary function for the perception of sound . The outer ear is comprised of the cartilaginous auricle  and the external auditory meatus , both of which serve to facilitate the reception of sound waves conducted by the air by funneling them towards the tympanic membrane  located at the internal extent of the meatus. The contour of the helical-shaped auricle alters the frequency spectrum of sound depending on the position of the listener in reference to the location of the sound source."
"The tympanic membrane resembles a resilient trampoline that oscillates in response to incoming sound waves. Moreover, it forms a partition and seals off the external auditory meatus from the middle ear cavity. The middle ear, also referred to as the tympanic cavity, consists of an irregularshaped air-filled chamber, embedded in the petrous portion of the temporal bone."
"It contains several important elements: 1 Three small articulating bones: the auditory ossicles . 2 Two miniature skeletal muscles: the tensor tympani muscle, which attaches to the malleus, and the stapedius muscle, which attaches to the stapes. 3 Two membrane-covered foramina in the bone: the oval window and the round window."
"4 Two additional openings: the Eustachian  tube, which permits communication between the middle ear and nasopharynx, and the communication to the mastoid air cells. 5 The chorda tympani nerve: a branch of the facial nerve , which passes through but has no function in the middle ear. The middle ear functions in the transmission and transduction of tympanic membrane vibrations to the inner ear  ."
"The oval window and the round window both serve necessary functions in these processes. The ossicles are linked in series by synovial joints and are suspended within the tympanic cavity. Since they extend from the tympanic membrane to the membrane of the oval window, they conduct oscillations from the tympanic membrane to the membrane of the oval window."
"The intensity of these vibrations is dampened by the tensor tympani and the stapedius muscles. When the tensor tympani contracts, it tenses the tympanic membrane by pulling on the malleus, therefore reducing the vibrations transmitted from this membrane to the ossicles. When the stapedius contracts, it pulls on and stabilizes the stapes, therefore reducing the vibrations that are transmitted by the footplate of the stapes to the oval window of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear, and eventually to the auditory receptors."
"By dampening vibrations, they serve a protective reflex function for the auditory apparatus. The Eustachian tube  serves to equalize the atmospheric pressure between the middle and outer ear. At higher elevations, the atmospheric pressure in the external auditory meatus is lower than that of the middle ear cavity and causes the tympanic membrane to curve outwards  stimulating pain receptors of the tympanic membrane."
"Since the wall of the Eustachian tube is normally collapsed, pressure differences can be relieved by the action of swallowing, chewing, yawning, or coughing, which open the Eustachian tube, allowing equalization of pressure on the two sides of the tympanic membrane. The fluid-filled inner ear is embedded in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It consists of a bony  labyrinth  and a membranous labyrinth forming an interconnected system of channels and chambers that are filled with fluid."
"The bony labyrinth is divided into three regions: the vestibule, the three semicircular canals, and the cochlea . The vestibule and the semicircular canals are associated with the maintenance of equilibrium and are discussed in Chapter 18. The membranous labyrinth fits inside and is supported by the bony labyrinth and follows its general contour."
"The cochlea is a spiral, bony shell, resembling a snail shell , which winds 2. 5–2. 75 turns about its osseous axis, the modiolus."
"Bubble-like hollow areas dispersed within the modiolus house groups of nerve cell bodies of the bipolar sensory neurons that collectively form the cochlear  ganglion. The peripheral processes of these bipolar neurons terminate in the basal aspect of the hair cells of the organ of Corti, the cochlear receptor for hearing, whereas the central processes of these neurons form the root of the cochlear nerve. The cochlea’s interior is divided into three parallel, fluid-filled, compartments by two membranes, the vestibular  membrane and the basilar membrane."
"Each compartment is referred to as a scala  since each spirals about the modiolus like a winding staircase. They are: the  scala vestibuli ; the  scala media  , which is wedged between the vestibular and the basilar membranes ; and the  scala tympani  . The interior of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani is lined by a simple squamous epithelium."
"The perilymph-filled, bony, scala vestibuli of the cochlea is in direct communication with the perilymph-filled, bony, vestibule of the vestibular apparatus. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani, both of which are filled with perilymph, are joined at the helicotrema , a small connecting aperture located at the apex of the cochlea, which permits perilymph from the scala vestibuli to flow into the scala tympani. These canals are connected to the subarachnoid space via the endolymphatic duct, and the perilymph flows into the subarachnoid space thus contributing to the cerebrospinal fluid."
"It should also be noted that the scala vestibuli communicates with the oval window and the scala tympani communicates with the round window. The cochlear duct, also referred to as the scala media, contains endolymph. On cross-section of the cochlea, the triangular-shaped cochlear duct is wedged between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani with its apex attached to the spiral lamina of the modiolus."
"The vestibular  membrane, the roof of the cochlear duct, serves as a division between the cochlear duct and the scala vestibuli. This membrane consists of squamous epithelium. Its function is unclear; however it is believed to play a role in the transmission of vibrations from the perilymph of the scala vestibuli to the endolymph of the cochlear duct."
"The floor of the cochlear duct, which separates it from the scala tympani, is the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane is an elastic structure exhibiting a gradual increase in width, and a decrease in stiffness from the oval window  to the helicotrema . The gradual decrease in stiffness permits this membrane to be sensitive to high frequency vibrations near the cochlear base, and low frequency vibrations near its apex, at the helicotrema."
"Thus, the vestibular membrane is interposed between the scala vestibuli and the cochlear duct, whereas the basilar membrane is interposed between the cochlear duct and the scala tympani. The inner surface of the bony labyrinth bordering the scala media is the stria vascularis, which produces endolymph. The receptors associated with the sense of hearing form a structure, the  organ of Corti, which rests like a carpet along the floor of the cochlear duct on the basilar membrane."
"The organ of Corti consists of supporting epithelial cells and neuroepithelial receptor “hair cells. ” Each hair cell displays numerous stereocilia  and a single kinocilium projecting from its apical cell surface. The free ends of the stereocilia project into the tectorial membrane, an acellular, gelatinous substance, joined to the osseous spiral lamina ."
"The hair cells are the receptors of the auditory system that act as transducers, that is, they serve to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy that can be relayed to the brainstem. Hair cells synapse with the peripheral ends  of the bipolar neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the spiral ganglion. The central processes of these bipolar neurons form the cochlear nerve, which joins the vestibular nerve to form the vestibulocochlear nerve ."
"This nerve courses through the internal acoustic meatus to enter the cranial vault, and then enters the brainstem at the pontomedullary angle. The auricle and external auditory meatus channel sound waves to the tympanic membrane, which cause it to vibrate . Oscillations of the tympanic membrane cause the three ossicles to vibrate in sequence, conducting the vibration to the oval window."
"The articulating ossicles form a lever system, and not only mediate vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the membrane of the oval window, but—a fact of paramount importance— amplify these vibrations as they are converted from air waves of the outer ear into fluid waves  of the inner ear. Since liquids are more resistant to the conduction of sound waves, the incoming sound waves hitting the tympanic membrane have to be amplified by the ossicles in order to ensure adequate vibration of the perilymph. Since the tympanic membrane is much larger than the oval window membrane, and the sound waves reaching the oval window membrane are amplified by the ossicles, the compound effect is that the vibrations reaching the oval window have been amplified approximately 20-fold from the original vibrations at the tympanic membrane."
"The rapid oscillations of the stapes footplate cause the membrane covering the oval window to vibrate, which in turn agitates the perilymph fluid of the vestibule, causing fluid displacement and the formation of pressure waves. The pressure waves are propagated from the base of the cochlea, through the scala vestibuli, along the helical path to the apex of the cochlea. Although perilymph waves in the scala vestibuli also flow via the helicotrema to the scala tympani, the effect of these waves is probably minor and causes little stimulation of the organ of Corti."
"Perilymph waves in the scala vestibuli agitate the vestibular membrane, which begins to oscillate. The oscillating vestibular membrane generates waves in the endolymph of the cochlear duct, which in turn causes the basilar membrane to oscillate. Basilar membrane oscillations are initiated at the base of the cochlea and advance along the basilar membrane as a traveling wave towards the apex of the cochlea."
"Wave formation in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani is possible only because of the flexibility of the elastic membrane covering the round window, which vibrates and allows pressure formed by the waves to be released into the middle ear cavity, as the round window membrane protrudes towards it. Without the round window to compensate for the pressure exerted on the oval window, waves could not be propagated in the scala tympani since fluid completely enclosed in a bony compartment is resistant to compression. The bases of the hair receptor cells rest on the basilar membrane, whereas the tips of their cilia and stereocilia extend into the overlying tectorial membrane."
"It is the basilar membrane oscillations that cause a shearing force and deformation of the hair cells’ cilia and stereocilia, which are inserted  in the less mobile overlying tectorial membrane . This deformation causes depolarization of the cell membrane, and stimulation of the hair cells is transmitted to the dendritic processes of the bipolar sensory neurons. Sensory stimulation is then relayed by the cochlear nerve to the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem ."
"The pathway of auditory stimulation is summarized in . Auditory input travels in the auditory pathway, which begins with the first order neurons housed in the spiral  ganglion and continues as a chain of multisynaptic relays into the medulla, pons, mesencephalon, diencephalon , and finally the cerebral cortex. Due to the complexity of the auditory pathways, only the main pathways are discussed here."
"The auditory pathway transmits sensory input related to frequency , amplitude , and location of the sound. The auditory pathway relays sensory input by projecting bilaterally in the brain; that is, auditory input from each ear  ultimately flows to both cerebral hemispheres. The only site of unilateral  projection in the auditory pathway is the first relay, since each cochlear nerve projects to its ipsilateral cochlear nuclei."
"All subsequent relays of the auditory pathway are bilateral. The spiral  ganglion is unusual since its nerve cell bodies are not aggregated into a single ganglion. Instead, the cell bodies form numerous swellings that are embedded n hollow bubbles within the modiolus of the cochlea."
"The dendritic terminals of the peripheral processes of these neurons terminate in the organ of Corti and synapse with its specialized “hair cell” receptors. The central processes of these neurons collect to form the cochlear nerve . In the inner ear, the cochlear nerve joins the vestibular nerve to form the vestibulocochlear nerve."
"From the inner ear, the vestibulocochlear nerve then passes through the internal acoustic meatus to enter the posterior cranial fossa of the cranial vault. As it enters the brainstem at the pontomedullary angle, the vestibulocochlear nerve again separates into its two components, the vestibular nerve and the cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve terminates in the vestibular nuclei, whereas the cochlear nerve terminates in the cochlear nuclei."
"The vestibular and cochlear nuclei extend into the pons and the medulla. The central processes of the first order neurons of the cochlear nerve enter the ventral cochlear nucleus where they bifurcate, some branches terminating in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, with others terminating in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Thus, the ventral cochlear nucleus as well as the  dorsal cochlear nucleus are the first relay stations of auditory input."
"The ventral cochlear nucleus is subdivided into a posteroventral cochlear nucleus and an anteroventral cochlear nucleus. The anteroventral cochlear nucleus is the major nucleus of termination of cochlear nerve fibers. Second order fibers arising from the cochlear nuclei either ascend ipsilaterally from the anteroventral cochlear nucleus to the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, or decussate forming three different separate pathways: the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral acoustic striae ."
"Most of the decussating fibers arising from the anteroventral cochlear nucleus form a very noticeable group of fibers, the trapezoid body, also known as the ventral acoustic striae in the ventral pontine tegmentum. The fibers in the trapezoid body project to and terminate contralaterally either in: • the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which in turn projects to the lateral superior olivary nucleus; • the medial superior olivary nucleus; or • the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the inferior colliculus  . Second order fibers arising from the posteroventral cochlear nucleus form the intermediate acoustic stria ventral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus."
"These fibers subsequently join the ipsilateral and contralateral lateral lemniscus to ascend to, and terminate in, the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the inferior colliculus, bilaterally . Second order fibers arising from the dorsal cochlear nucleus form the dorsal acoustic stria, which decussates on the ventral aspect of the floor of the fourth ventricle. These fibers join the contralateral lateral lemniscus to ascend to, and terminate in, the inferior colliculus."
"The superior olivary nuclei form a nuclear complex housing third order neurons, located in the pontine tegmentum at the level of the facial nucleus. The main nuclei of this complex are the medial superior olivary nucleus and the lateral superior olivary nucleus, both of which receive second order fiber terminals from the cochlear nuclei , and have an important function in sound localization. The superior olivary nuclei process auditory information from both ears, and determine the direction and location that a sound is coming from in the following manner."
"The medial superior olivary nucleus processes auditory input by comparing the amount of time it takes for a sound to reach each ear, whereas the lateral superior olivary nucleus processes auditory input by comparing the intensity  of a sound arriving at each ear. Thus a sound arising from a source, such as a telephone located to one’s right, arrives at the right ear sooner than it does in the left ear, and the sound is slightly louder in the right ear than it is in the left ear. If a sound arises from a source that is located at an equal distance from both ears, then the sound arrives at both ears at the same time."
"The neurons in the lateral superior olivary nucleus are stimulated by impulses transmitted by second order fibers arising from the ipsilateral anteroventral cochlear nucleus and are inhibited by impulses transmitted by second order fibers arising from the contralateral anteroventral cochlear nucleus. The lateral lemniscus is the main ascending pathway of the auditory system in the brainstem, conveying auditory input from both ears. In summary, the lateral lemniscus  contains the following."
1 Second order fibers arising from the contralateral anteroventral cochlear nucleus  that terminate in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the inferior colliculus. 2 Second order fibers arising from the ipsilateral and contralateral posteroventral cochlear nucleus that terminate in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in the inferior colliculus. 3 Second order fibers arising from the contralateral dorsal cochlear nucleus that terminate in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in the inferior colliculus.
"4 Third order fibers originating from the superior olivary nuclear complex  that terminate in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in the superior colliculus. 5 Fibers arising from the dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus that project to the ipsilateral inferior colliculus. The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus contains neurons that process auditory input from only one ear, whereas the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus houses neurons that process auditory input from both ears."
"The inferior colliculus , located in the roof of the caudal midbrain, is a mesencephalic relay nucleus of the auditory system. It receives afferents ascending in the lateral lemniscus from the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nuclear complex, and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. The inferior colliculus also receives afferents from the contralateral inferior colliculus and the auditory cortex."
"The inferior colliculus gives rise to a prominent bundle, the brachium of the inferior colliculus , an arm-like structure whose fibers end in the ipsilateral medial geniculate nucleus, a thalamic relay station of the auditory system. The inferior colliculus also projects to the contralateral medial geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus  to mediate audiovisual reflex activity such as turning the head and eyes in the direction of a startling noise. The inferior colliculus is associated with sound localization."
"Fibers arising in the medial geniculate nucleus form the auditory radiations that join the sublenticular portion of the posterior limb of the internal capsule to terminate in the primary auditory cortex. The medial geniculate nucleus processes auditory input related to sound intensity  and frequency , and transmits it to the auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex receives the auditory radiations from the lateral geniculate nucleus."
"This cortical region has a tonotopic representation of frequencies; that is, neurons responding to low frequencies reside in its rostral extent, whereas neurons responding to high frequencies reside in its caudal extent. The primary auditory cortex is arranged into two-dimensional, alternating, vertically oriented columns of neurons . One dimension of the auditory cortex is composed of frequency columns."
"The cells in each frequency column respond to an auditory stimulus of a particular frequency. As mentioned above, cells responding to low frequencies reside in the frequency columns located in the rostral extent of the transverse temporal gyri of Heschl, whereas frequency columns containing cells responding to gradually higher frequencies are lined up in sequence toward the caudal extent of the primary auditory cortex. The other dimension of the auditory cortex is composed of alternating binaural columns."
"There are two types of binaural columns: summation columns and suppression columns. The neurons residing in the summation columns respond to an auditory stimulus that stimulates both ears simultaneously. In contrast, the neurons in the suppression columns respond maximally to an auditory stimulus that stimulates only one ear, but respond minimally when the auditory stimulus stimulates both ears."
"The primary auditory cortex of each side sends projections to the contralateral side via the corpus callosum. The primary auditory cortex plays an important function in the detection of alteration in pattern as well as the localization of a sound. The secondary auditory cortical areas, although numerous, are not well defined."
"They border the primary auditory cortex and form reciprocal connections with the primary auditory cortex. The secondary auditory cortical areas play an important function in the interpretation of sounds, and via connections with Wernicke’s area function in the comprehension of language. The superior olivary nucleus, one of the nuclei of the olivary nuclear complex, gives rise to the olivocochlear bundle  whose fibers descend both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to terminate in the spiral organ of Corti, where they synapse with receptor hair cells ."
"This tract has an inhibitory effect on cochlear nerve activity, modulating and sharpening auditory transmission. Thus the cochlea is innervated by the peripheral  processes of the first order bipolar neurons of the cochlear nerve, as well as the olivocochlear  fibers arising from the brainstem. A loud noise heard in one ear causes a reflex contraction of both the tensor tympani and the stapedius muscles of both ears, and therefore dampen, bilaterally, the transmission of excessively loud and/or startling sound wave signals from the outer to the inner ear."
The sound waves entering one ear follow the normal auditory pathway via the cochlear nerve to the ipsilateral ventral cochlear nucleus. Each ventral cochlear nucleus projects bilaterally to the superior olivary nuclei. They in turn project bilaterally to the facial motor nuclei and the motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve.
Each facial motor nucleus projects to the ipsilateral stapedius muscle. Each motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve projects to the ipsilateral tensor tympani muscle . Hearing defects can result from many causes.
"A unilateral lesion in the facial nerve  proximal to giving rise to the branch to the stapedius muscle results in hyperacusis, characterized by abnormally acute hearing in the affected ear. This condition often occurs in individuals with Bell’s palsy. Hearing defects may be categorized into conduction deafness and sensorineural  deafness."
"Conduction deafness usually involves the auditory apparatus of the outer and/or middle ear and is caused by a defect in the mechanical transmission of sound from the air-filled outer and/or middle ear to the fluid-filled inner ear, which interferes with sound conduction. Conduction deafness may result from: 1 Cerumen  buildup in the external auditory canal. 2 Perforation of the tympanic membrane."
"3 Otitis media, which is a middle ear inflammation and is accompanied by fluid accumulation in the middle ear chamber . 4 Otosclerosis , which is the most common pathologic condition resulting in conduction deafness in adults. It is a consequence of new bone deposition of the labyrinthine spongy bone bordering the oval window with subsequent fixation of the stapes on the oval window."
"Otosclerosis can be surgically corrected by releasing the stapes. A hearing aid often improves conduction deafness. Sensorineural  deafness results following a lesion involving the cochlea, the cochlear nerve, or the central auditory pathways."
"A lesion involving the cochlea, the cochlear nerve, or the cochlear nuclei results in an ipsilateral hearing deficit. Injury to the hair receptor cells may be caused from extensive exposure to loud noise, antibiotics, or other drugs such as aspirin, or various prenatal infections, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, or syphilis. The most prevalent sensorineural hearing deficit occurring in the elderly is presbycusis ."
"This condition results from the gradual degeneration of the spiral organ of Corti. Acoustic neuroma  is a tumor arising from the Schwann cells covering the vestibulocochlear nerve . This tumor appears in the internal auditory meatus, or close to the cerebellopontine angle after the nerve leaves the brainstem in the posterior cranial fossa."
This tumor causes nerve destruction resulting in total loss of hearing  in the ipsilateral ear and tinnitus  and/or vestibular symptoms. Lesions involving the central auditory pathways  result in minor hearing impairments mainly in the contralateralside. This is due to the bilateral projections of the auditory pathway.
"The individual will have difficulty in localizing sounds in the contralateral side if the lesion involves the ascending auditory pathways rostral to the level of the pons, or if the primary or secondary auditory cortex is involved. Recent studies support that genetic mutations are the underlying cause of some cases  of congenital bilateral deafness. The Jervell–LangeNielsen syndrome is a recessively inherited genetic disorder associated with bilateral deafness."
"This syndrome results from the formation of defective ion channel complexes in the stria vascularis lining the lateral wall of the cochlear duct . The cells of the stria vascularis regulate the ionic composition of endolymph in the cochlear duct, which is an important component in the formation of nerve impulses in the auditory system. Hearing defects may result from conduction deafness or sensorineural deafness."
"Conduction deafness usually involves the auditory apparatus of the outer and/or middle ear and is caused by a defect in the mechanical transmission of sound from the air-filled outer and/or middle ear to the fluid-filled inner ear, which interferes with sound conduction. Sensorineural  deafness results following a lesion involving the cochlea, the cochlear nerve, or the central auditory pathways. This case requires further testing since clinical evaluation alone will not determine the cause of deafness."
"The other noted symptoms are vague or nonspecific, although the dizziness and imbalance could possibly indicate vestibular or cerebellar dysfunction. This patient should have a full examination by an otolaryngologist and imaging of the base of the skull, mastoid, inner ear, and auditory canals. MRI is best but CT may be adequate."
"This patient’s MRI  showed an acoustic neuroma of the right eighth cranial nerve, more properly known as a schwannoma. An acoustic neuroma is a fairly common, benign tumor of Schwann cells . Schwannomas commonly arise from cranial nerve VIII although they can affect any nerve, particularly the cranial nerves."
Acoustic neuromas are bulbous or fusiform tumors that are seen in the cerebellopontine angle. The most common and initial symptom of an acoustic neuroma is typically unilateral hearing loss. Dizziness  and ataxia can arise from dysfunction of the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII or from cerebellar dysfunction secondary to compression.
"Other symptoms, such as facial numbness or weakness, can arise from compression of the corresponding cranial nerves. Acoustic neuromas are unilateral, with one notable exception. Neurofibromatosis type II leads to multiple tumors, including bilateral acoustic neuromas."
A cerebellopontine angle meningioma can be confused with an acoustic neuroma. The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision. Hearing can only sometimes be restored.
A 65-year-old woman presents to the office with 2 weeks of dizziness. She described the dizziness as a whirling sensation that made her feel as though her head was spinning. Each spell lasts for about 10–20 seconds.
"She has several spells per day, and notes that turning in bed and looking upward exacerbates this condition. Since these spells are so incapacitating, she is afraid to move. She feels normal in between these spells."
"She does not have any ringing in the ears, or visual, hearing, or speech problems. Walking and balance are normal, except during the dizzy spells. There has not been any trauma, history of similar dizziness, or recent infection."
"Kinesthesis  is mediated by a somatosensory system that makes us aware of the relative position and motion of our various body parts with respect to one another, and to objects in our environment that we may come in contact with. The position and motion of different body parts are detected and monitored by special receptors located in the muscles, tendons, and joints. Our kinesthetic sense assists us in the maintenance of our posture and the control of a myriad of voluntary motor activities."
"Working with our kinesthetic sense is the sense of equilibrium , mediated by the vestibular system. The vestibular system, a proprioceptive  system, mediates the special functions of posture maintenance, muscle tone, equilibrium, and coordination of head and eye movements. Also, it transmits sensory information to the brain regarding the position of the body and spatial orientation."
"The vestibular system is equipped with two groups of receptors. One group detects angular acceleration  of the head, as in turning the head from side to side. The other group of receptors detects spatial orientation of the head in space, relative to gravity and linear acceleration or deceleration forces."
"Sensory input from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems is integrated by the nervous system, especially the cerebellum, to generate motor responses that maintain equilibrium, posture, muscle tone, and reflex movements of the eyes, all of which are carried out at the subconscious level. The sensory apparatus of the vestibular system resides in the inner ear, housed in the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is composed of a bony  labyrinth  and a membranous labyrinth. Sensory information about the orientation and motion of the head , is detected by the receptors in the vestibular  apparatus  and is relayed to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and the cerebellum by the vestibular nerve ."
"The vestibular system, in concert with the cerebellum, then mediates appropriate postural adjustments. The bony labyrinth of the inner ear  includes the cochlea, three bony semicircular canals, and the vestibule. The cochlea is a special receptor that mediates hearing and has no function in equilibrium ."
"The semicircular canals and the vestibule, however, are associated with equilibrium. There are three semicircular canals in the inner ear. They are the anterior , lateral , and posterior  canals."
"The semicircular canals are oriented along three planes of angular or rotational movement, at nearly right angles to each other. Both ends of the C-shaped canals attach to and open into the bony vestibule . The anterior canal  of each side, is positioned anterolateral to the median plane ."
"It is oriented parallel to the posterior canal , on the contralateral side, which is positioned posterolateral to the median plane . These two canals function as a pair. The two lateral canals of the right and left sides are oriented in the same  plane, and they too function as a pair."
"Pilots and astronauts refer to the three planes of rotational movement as pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch refers to forward and backward tilting of the head, as when we nod our head “yes. ” Roll refers to tilting the head sideways from one shoulder to the other shoulder, and yaw refers to movement of the head form side to side, as when indicating “no."
"” The lateral semicircular canals are oriented in the horizontal yaw plane, whereas the anterior and posterior semicircular canals are oriented in the half pitch/half roll planes. When the head is in its normal upright position, the anterior and posterior canals are oriented almost in the vertical plane, whereas the lateral canals are oriented almost in the horizontal plane. During a certain movement that affects a particular functional pair of canals , the receptors in one canal of the pair are stimulated and excite the afferent axons of the vestibulocochlear nerve, whereas the receptors in its complementary canal on the contralateral side, are inhibited and diminish neural activity."
"The vestibule is a component of the bony labyrinth, receiving the open ends of the three semicircular canals. It is a perilymph-filled space that is continuous with the perilymphatic space of the semicircular canals. The vestibule houses two membranous sacs, the utricle and saccule."
"The utricle and saccule each contain an elliptical-shaped sensory receptor, the macula  . The membranous labyrinth is housed within the bony labyrinth, and reflects its general shape and contour. The space separating the bony labyrinth from the membranous labyrinth is the perilymphatic space, filled with a fluid referred to as perilymph, which is comparable to extracellular fluid."
"The membranous labyrinth consists of a series of membranous sacs and ducts filled with another viscous fluid, referred to as endolymph, which is comparable to intracellular fluid. The components of the membranous labyrinth associated with equilibrium are the three  semicircular ducts  and the  utricle and saccule, two saclike structures that are enclosed within the bony vestibule. The region of the membranous labyrinth containing the receptor for hearing is the cochlear duct, which is enclosed in the bony cochlea ."
"Endolymph percolates  in the three membranous semicircular ducts, the utricle, the saccule, and the cochlear duct. The ductus reuniens permits communication between the lumen of the cochlear duct with the lumen of the components of the vestibular membranous labyrinth. Both ends of each of the semicircular ducts are attached to, and empty into, the utricle."
"Each semicircular duct has a single dilated segment, an ampulla , near one of its ends. The ampullae of the three semicircular ducts, as well as the utricle and saccule, contain in their interior the sensory receptors of the vestibular system. The receptors in the ampullae of the semicircular ducts are the cristae ampullares, whereas the receptors in the utricle and the saccule are the macula utriculi and the macula sacculi, respectively ."
"Thus there are a total of five receptors  in each vestibular sensory apparatus. The cristae ampullares of the semicircular canals rest in a patch of neuroepithelium at the base of each ampulla. The macula utriculi rests in a strip of neuroepithelium on the base of the utricle, whereas the macula sacculi is oriented vertically on the medial wall of the saccule."
"The vestibular receptors consist of a distinct area of neuroepithelium inside the membranous labyrinth, composed of mechanoreceptor “hair cells” and support cells that fill the spaces among the hair cells . The hair cells display sensory “hairs,” many stiff stereocilia , and a single immotile kinocilium. These hair cells, like the hair cells in the cochlea that are involved in hearing, are transducers that transform the mechanical stimulation imposed on them, into electrical signals."
"Electrical signals are transmitted to, and are then conveyed by, the vestibular nerve to the brainstem and cerebellum. Both afferent and efferent nerve endings terminate on the basal and lateral aspects of the hair cells. The neuroepithelia of the cristae ampullares, macula utriculi, and macula sacculi are covered with a gelatinous glycoprotein membrane."
"The stereocilia and kinocilia are embedded in this membrane. Movement of the hair cells with respect to the membrane results in a process by which mechanical deformation of the stereocilia and kinocilia is transformed into an electrical potential. In the utricle and the saccule, the gelatinous glycoprotein membranes overlying their macula have, on their free surface, otoconia  also referred to as otoliths —crystals consisting of calcium carbonate ."
"Since the gelatinous glycoprotein membrane of the utricle and the saccule has otoliths, it is referred to as the otolithic membrane, and the utricle and the saccule are referred to as otolithic organs. The otoliths have a specific gravity that is greater than that of the endolymph which surrounds them, and they are consequently pulled by gravity. Gravity applies a continuous linear acceleration on the head, and thus deflects the gelatinous membrane, which in turn stimulates the hair cells."
"The glycoprotein membrane of the cristae ampullares is dome-shaped and is called the cupula, which is devoid of crystals . The cupula increases resistance to the flow of endolymph and unlike the otolithic membranes is not influenced by gravitational forces. Instead, it responds to endolymphatic flow."
The cupula is a mechanical structure that narrows the lumen of the canal and so increases resistance to flow. The three cristae ampullares enclosed in the semicircular duct ampullae  detect angular acceleration or deceleration  of the head . The differing orientation of the three semicircular ducts enable an individual to perceive motion in all planes.
"Head rotation in a particular plane will result in endolymphatic flow in the functional pair of canals oriented closest to the plane of rotation, and is almost perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Head rotation in a plane that is not parallel to that of any one canal, will activate more than one canal. The receptors in the utricle and saccule  detect spatial orientation of the head in space relative to gravity and linear acceleration or deceleration forces."
"The receptors in the utricle and in the saccule are oriented perpendicular to each other, and therefore can detect motion in two different planes. When the head is upright, the macula utriculi is oriented in the horizontal plane  and can be stimulated  by linear forces  in the horizontal plane . The macula sacculi is oriented in the vertical plane  and can be stimulated  by linear forces  in the vertical plane ."
"Note that the macula utriculi and the macula sacculi perceive head orientation when the body itself is at rest, but is exposed to external forces. When the body is at rest, and the head is tilted, the otoconia  are pulled by gravitational forces, causing the membrane to slant, which in turn deflects the “hairs”  embedded in it. The hair deflection stimulates the mechanoreceptor hair cells, which in turn transmit the stimulation to the vestibular nerve dendrites synapsing with them."
"In angular  movement of the head , the bony semicircular canals and the enclosed membranous semicircular ducts rotate at the same velocity as the head. However, the viscous endolymph filling the ducts resists flow initially, and thus “falls behind” due to inertia . This resistance causes a relative motion difference between the faster moving cupula  and the slower endolymphatic flow."
"This motion difference results in flow of the endolymph in the direction opposite to that of the crista’s cupula, pressing against and tilting the cupula. This action deflects the stereocilia embedded in the cupula. The stereocilia that are deflected away from the kinocilium  elicits hyperpolarization  of the hair cell."
"Whereas the stereocilia that are deflected toward the kinocilium  stretch the hair cell membrane and elicit depolarization  of the hair cell, and therefore initiate a nerve impulse that is relayed to the vestibular nerve afferent peripheral nerve endings. Flow of endolymph in the direction of the ampulla of the horizontal canal results in deflection of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium, which stimulates the hair cell. In the anterior and posterior semicircular canals, flow of endolymph in the direction of the ampulla has the opposite effect, that is the hair cells are inhibited."
"If rotation is sustained, the endolymph of the semicircular canals eventually moves at the same rate as the cupula. When this occurs, the cupula is no longer pushed and bent by the endolymph, and the stereocilia and kinocilia are no longer deflected. Since the hair cells are no longer depolarized, the semicircular canal receptors are not activated by sustained rotation."
"Following about 20 seconds of continued rotation, however, the cupula slowly recoils back to its resting position. When the head stops rotating, so do the ducts and the canals. However, the endolymphatic flow persists within the membranous duct due to its momentum, pressing on, and bending the cupula from its resting position in the opposite direction , causing the stereocilia to bend away from the kinocilium, thus inhibiting the hair cell from firing completely."
"A few seconds later, endolymphatic flow ceases and within 20 seconds the cupula once again recoils back to its resting position, permitting the hair cell to emit impulses at a tonic level. Therefore, the semicircular canal conveys a positive signal at the onset of head rotation only if movement is in the correct direction, and conveys a negative signal when head rotation ceases. It is important to note that the function of the equilibratory senses mediated by the vestibular system is to perceive differences in the relative movement between the endolymph and the receptor gelatinous membrane , rather than to merely detect motion ."
"Slow, slight rotation sends signals to the brain that indicate movement. Fast, intense rotation  overwhelms the receptors, sending a flood of signals to the brain, with consequent dizziness and/or nausea. When an individual is aboard a ship in a room without a window and cannot see outside, his vestibular system sends information to the brain that he is moving , however he cannot “see” that he is actually moving."
"The inconsistency of the sensory information  that is sent to the brain by the vestibular and visual systems causes him to feel seasick. Going out on deck where he can see that he is moving, which confirms the vestibular input to the brain, alleviates the symptoms. When an individual  is exposed to an environment with zero gravity, he experiences space sickness, an unusual phenomenon affecting his sense of equilibrium."
"Some scientists believe that in space, the brain receives only slight or no vestibular sensory input due to the lack of gravity, causing space sickness. Others believe that space sickness is similar to car or sea sickness and is caused by a sensory mismatch as described above. The cell bodies of the first order bipolar neurons of the vestibular pathway reside in the vestibular  ganglion, a sensory ganglion of the vestibular nerve."
"The peripheral processes of these bipolar neurons  terminate in the cristae ampullares of the semicircular ducts, the macula utriculi of the utricle, and the macula sacculi of the saccule, where they form synapses with the mechanoreceptor epithelial “hair cells. ” The hair cells are transducers; that is, they transform mechanical stimulation into electrical stimulation , which is relayed to the dendritic terminals of the first order bipolar neurons. The central processes of the bipolar neurons gather to form the root of the vestibular nerve ."
"In the inner ear, the vestibular nerve joins the cochlear nerve, to form the vestibulocochlear nerve. Although the two nerves accompany one another wrapped in a common connective tissue sheath, they are anatomically and functionally two distinct nerves. From the inner ear, the vestibulocochlear nerve passes through the internal auditory meatus to enter the posterior cranial vault."
"As the vestibulocochlear nerve enters the brainstem at the pontomedullary angle, it separates into its two component nerves. The fibers of the cochlear nerve synapse in the cochlear nuclei in the medulla . The vestibular nerve fibers enter the vestibular nuclei located in the pons and upper medulla, where most of the central processes of the vestibular nerve bifurcate into ascending and descending terminals."
"Some first order vestibular fibers, however, do not terminate in the vestibular nuclei, but take an alternate route by going around them, joining the juxtarestiform body in the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminating directly in the ipsilateral flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum. This direct termination of the central processes of the first order bipolar neurons in the cerebellum is unique to the vestibular system. Unlike other sensory systems, the projections of the vestibular system are mainly reflexive in nature ."
"Sensory input is integrated to produce coordinated movement of the head, eyes, and body, and to maintain equilibrium and muscle tone. The vestibular system mainly projects to the following structures: 1 The motor nuclei of the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves that innervate the extraocular muscles and thus control reflex eye movements. 2 The cerebellum, which integrates sensory input from various systems and coordinates head and body movement."
"3 The reticular formation at the pontine and medullary levels, where reflex motor activity is initiated. 4 The spinal cord, where postural adjustments can be made. he vestibular nuclear complex is composed of four vestibular nuclei , and the central processes of the first order bipolar neurons of the vestibular  ganglion that terminate there."
The four vestibular nuclei are: 1 The superior  vestibular nucleus. 2 The medial  vestibular nucleus. 3 The lateral  vestibular nucleus.
"4 The inferior  vestibular nucleus. The vestibular nuclei are located in the upper medulla and lower pons, lateral to the fourth ventricle, in close proximity to the cerebellum. The superior nucleus is located entirely in the pons, whereas the other three nuclei extend into both the caudal pons and the rostral medulla."
"These nuclei contain the cell bodies of second order neurons whose fibers carry outflow signals to various destinations. The superior and medial vestibular nuclei receive the first order neuron terminals relaying sensory input from the cristae ampullares of the semicircular canals. Following the reception of this sensory input, these nuclei then relay it via two structures: 1 The medial longitudinal fasciculus  to the extraocular muscle nuclei to elicit compensatory ocular movements triggered by movements of the head."
"2 The medial vestibulospinal tract to the cervical spinal cord to elicit suitable head movements. The lateral vestibular nucleus receives vestibular sensory input mainly from the maculae of the utricle, but may also receive input from the saccule and semicircular canals. This nucleus projects via the lateral vestibulospinal tract to motoneurons or interneurons at all spinal cord levels to make postural adjustments."
The inferior vestibular nucleus receives vestibular sensory input from the semicircular canals as well as the utricle. Most of the first order vestibular fibers terminate in this nucleus. It projects to the reticular formation and the cerebellum.
The vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum serve as the first relay centers of the vestibular pathway. The vestibular nerve is unique since it is the only cranial nerve that sends some of its first order afferent fibers relaying sensory input directly from peripheral receptors to the cerebellar cortex. The vestibular nuclei receive afferent  projections from numerous sources.
"There are a number of input sources to the vestibular nuclei: 1 The central processes of the bipolar first order neurons of the vestibular nerve, which transmit sensory input from the vestibular receptor apparatus in the inner ear . 2 The vestibulocerebellum  and part of the uvula, which project their fibers to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei via the juxtarestiform body . 3 The spinocerebellum , which projects its fibers to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei via the juxtarestiform body."
"4 The fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum, which projects bilaterally to the vestibular nuclei via the fastigiovestibular tract. 5 The reciprocal connections from the contralateral vestibular nuclei. 6 The spinal cord."
"7 The pretectal nuclei. The spinal cord sends proprioceptive information to the vestibular nuclei via the spinovestibular tract regarding the orientation status of the body so that postural adjustments can be made. The vestibular nuclei project second order fibers to the following areas : 1 The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens motor nuclei as well as the accessory oculomotor nuclei: the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the nucleus of Darkschewitch via the medial longitudinal fasciculus ."
"2 The contralateral vestibular nuclei, most of which are reciprocal inhibitory connections. 3 The inferior olivary nucleus , which in turn projects to the cerebellar vermis via the restiform body. 4 The ipsilateral flocculus and nodulus ."
"5 The uvula. 6 The fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum , via the juxtarestiform body . 7 Spinal cord ventral horn alpha and gamma motoneurons and interneurons."
"8 The vestibular labyrinth, where descending efferent fibers modulate afferent input to the vestibular nuclei. The superior vestibular nucleus fibers join the ipsilateral and contralateral MLF and project to the oculomotor nuclear complex as well as the trochlear nuclei bilaterally. Some of the fibers arising from the medial vestibular nucleus join the ipsilateral and the contralateral MLF to terminate in the oculomotor nuclear complex and the abducens nucleus bilaterally, whereas other medial vestibular nuclear fibers join only the contralateral MLF and terminate in the contralateral trochlear nucleus and inter-stitial nucleus of Cajal."
"Fibers arising from the inferior vestibular nucleus join the ipsilateral and contralateral MLF to terminate in the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei bilaterally. All of these ascending  connections function in the coordination of eye movements. Since the MLF also carries descending fibers from the medial vestibular nucleus to the spinal cord , it functions in the coordination of head, eye, and neck movements."
"The lateral vestibulospinal tract originates only from the lateral vestibular nucleus. This tract descends ipsilaterally and terminates at all levels of the spinal cord although it projects more fibers at the cervical and lumbar levels, where it synapses with both interneurons and with alpha and gamma motoneurons in the spinal cord ventral horn. On its way to the spinal cord, the lateral vestibulospinal tract gives rise to collaterals that synapse in the reticular formation of the medulla."
"Functionally, the lateral vestibulospinal tract regulates the activity of spinal cord motoneurons in order to maintain posture. It forms excitatory synapses with the alpha and gamma motoneurons whose fibers innervate extensor  muscles in the neck, trunk, and lower limb, as well as inhibitory synapses via interneurons to the alpha and gamma motoneurons that innervate flexor muscles . The medial vestibulospinal tract originates primarily from the medial vestibular nucleus."
"This tract descends bilaterally in the MLF and terminates in the cervical spinal cord where it, too, forms synapses with interneurons and alpha and gamma motoneurons, innervating neck extensors. Functionally, since the medial vestibulospinal tract terminates in the cervical spinal cord, it serves to coordinate head and ocular movements. The inferior vestibular nucleus gives rise to fibers that terminate in the inferior olivary nucleus, the reticular formation in the medulla, the cerebellum, and the cervical spinal cord via the MLF."
"All output vestibular projections distribute collaterals in the medullary, pontine, and mesencephalic reticular formation. These relays play an important function in the reflexive control and coordination of head and eye movements. The superior and lateral vestibular nuclei give rise to second order fibers that join the MLF bilaterally to ascend to the ventral posterior lateral and ventral posterior inferior nuclei of the thalamus."
"The thalamus gives rise to third order fibers that terminate in the primary vestibular cortex  in the parietal lobe, located next to the primary motor area . Brodmann’s area 3a is believed to be the site of integration of sensory input from the vestibular and other proprioceptive systems . The associations between Brodmann’s areas 3a and 4 serve in the regulation of motor activity."
"Eye movements are categorized into conjugate eye movements and disconjugate  eye movements. Conjugate eye movements, in which both eyes turn toward the same direction simultaneously , include:  smooth pursuit eye movements, which are involuntary, slow, and smooth, and occur during the tracking of a moving object ;  optokinetic eye movements, which are tracking eye movements and are triggered by motion of the visual field;  saccadic eye movements, which are rapid and abrupt, voluntary or involuntary, and change the point of visual fixation; and  vestibular eye movements, which are involuntary eye movements triggered by head movements . Disconjugate eye movements consist of vergence eye movements in which both eyes turn in opposite directions simultaneously."
"Vergence eye movements are involuntary and may be:  convergent ; or  divergent . The motor nuclei  innervating the extraocular muscles receive inputs from various sources, which indirectly control voluntary or involuntary ocular movements. There are four principal projection sources to these nuclei."
"1 Upper motoneurons from the frontal eye field controlling voluntary eye movements. 2 The vestibular system, which detects head motion and coordinates head and eye movements via:  the pontine reticular formation lateral gaze center  that controls conjugate horizontal ocular movements; and  a center for vertical gaze in the periaqueductal gray of the mesencephalon, which controls conjugate vertical ocular movements, in order to keep the eyes fixed on a stationary object as the head is moving. 3 Projections from the visual cortex to the rostral midbrain , that play a role in the tracking of a moving object by moving the eyes in order to maintain the image of a moving object on the retina."
"4 Projections from the auditory system that play a role in causing a sudden  turning of the eyes in the direction of a startling sound. The extraocular muscles that control ocular movements receive innervation from motoneurons whose cell bodies are housed in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei. The superior oblique is innervated by the trochlear nerve, the lateral rectus is innervated by the abducent nerve, whereas the remainder of the extraocular muscles, the superior and inferior rectus, the medial rectus, and the inferior oblique, are innervated by the oculomotor nerve."
"To produce smooth, coordinated ocular movements as one extraocular muscle contracts, its antagonists relax. As the head moves, the eyes may gaze at a motionless object by reflex activity mediated by vestibular neural circuits that connect the vestibular system  with the cranial nerve nuclei . This elicits compensatory ocular movements, so that the object can remain in the field of vision."
"When the head is turned , it induces subtle endolymphatic flow in both horizontal semicircular canals. The endolymph flows to the left since its inertia causes it to “fall behind” relative to the movement of the head. The endolymphatic flow causes deflection of the cupula in the right horizontal canal ampulla, bending the “hair cell” sensory hairs toward the kinocilium, and increasing the neural activity of the crista ampullaris of the right horizontal canal ampulla."
"There is a simultaneous decrease in neural activity of the crista ampullaris of the left horizontal canal ampulla. The depolarized hair cells  transmit sensory information to the peripheral  terminals of the first order, vestibular ganglion neurons. The central processes of these neurons terminate in the ipsilateral  vestibular nuclei where they synapse with neurons whose axons join the MLF and terminate in the contralateral  abducens nucleus ."
"In the abducens nucleus, the axon terminals synapse with and stimulate the motoneurons that project directly to, and innervate, the contralateral  lateral rectus muscle as well as another group of neurons that cross the midline, join the contralateral  MLF and terminate in the contralateral  oculomotor nucleus where they synapse with the motoneurons that innervate the right medial rectus muscle. Thus the muscles that would cause conjugate horizontal ocular movement in the opposite direction to that of the head movement are stimulated. The second order vestibular fibers that terminate in the ipsilateral  abducens nucleus inhibit the motoneurons that project directly to, and innervate, the ipsilateral  lateral rectus muscle as well as another group of neurons that cross the midline, join the contralateral MLF, and terminate in the contralateral  oculomotor nucleus where they synapse with the motoneurons that innervate the contralateral  medial rectus muscle."
"Thus, the muscles that would cause conjugate  horizontal ocular movement in the same direction as the head movement are inhibited. The outcome of this mechanism is the reflex turning of both eyes to the left to maintain an image on the retina as the head is turned to the right. In summary, when an individual fixes his gaze on  an object and then begins to turn his head, for example to the right, the eyes will reflexly  “turn” to the left , which is opposite to the direction of head movement."
"This turning of the eyes  compensates for the shifting of head position in order to maintain visual fixation on an object. Otherwise, without this vestibular reflex mechanism coupling head and eye movements, as the erect head moves from a certain position  the eyes would remain still, perceiving a changing visual field in the duration of head movement. The vestibulocerebellum regulates vestibulo-ocular reflex activity in order to produce compensatory ocular movement for the head movement and can cancel it so that the eyes can move from a target."
"During movement of the head in the vertical plane , information is transmitted from the canal-specific vestibular system via reflex circuit connections to the trochlear and oculomotor nuclei, which innervate extraocular muscles controlling vertical eye movement. If the head is erect and the eyes are fixed  on an object, as the head is tilted forward or backward, a reflex will be automatically activated. This causes a “reflex turning” of the eyes upward or downward, respectively, in order to maintain visual fixation on the object."
"When tilting the head forward, the eyes will reflexly turn upward. This is caused by endolymphatic flow in the anterior  vertical semicircular canal and the subsequent deflection of its cupula. Deflection of the cupula stimulates the hair cells, which transmit sensory input to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei."
"The first order fibers synapse with both inhibitory and excitatory second order vestibular neurons . Second order inhibitory vestibular neurons join the ipsilateral MLF and ascend to, terminate in, and inhibit:  the ipsilateral trochlear nucleus, whose neurons give rise to fibers that decussate and then exit the brainstem to innervate the contralateral superior oblique muscle; and  the oculomotor nucleus, which sends fibers to innervate the ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle. Second order excitatory vestibular neurons give rise to fibers that decussate, join the contralateral MLF, and ascend to terminate in the contralateral oculomotor nucleus where they synapse with neurons that innervate the contralateral superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles."
"In summary, as the head tilts forward, the eyes turn upward by the simultaneous inhibition of the neurons that innervate the superior oblique and inferior rectus muscles of both eyes, and the stimulation of the neurons that innervate the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of both eyes. When tilting the head backward, the eyes will reflexly turn downward. This is caused by endolymphatic flow in the posterior  vertical semicircular canal and the subsequent deflection of its cupula."
"Deflection of the cupula stimulates the hair cells, which transmit sensory input to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. The first order neurons synapse with both inhibitory and excitatory second order vestibular neurons . Second order inhibitory vestibular neurons join the ipsilateral MLF and ascend to terminate in the oculomotor nucleus where they synapse with neurons that inhibit the ipsilateral superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles."
"Second order excitatory vestibular neurons give rise to fibers that decussate, join the contralateral MLF, and terminate in:  the trochlear nucleus, where they synapse with neurons that give rise to fibers that cross the midline and exit in the trochlear nerve, to innervate the superior oblique muscle; and  the oculomotor nucleus, where they synapse with neurons that innervate the inferior rectus muscle. In summary, when the head tilts backward, the eyes turn downward by the simultaneous inhibition of the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of both eyes and the stimulation of the superior oblique and inferior rectus muscles of both eyes. Horizontal nystagmus is a normal movement of the eyes when it is induced by activation of the vestibular apparatus."
"The distinguishing characteristic of nystagmus is a rhythmic, back and forth movement of the eyes, with a slow component in one direction, and a fast component  in the other direction following asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular sensory apparatus of the two sides. Spontaneous nystagmus, however, is pathologic, and is indicative of a lesion affecting the vestibular nuclei. A lesion in the vestibular apparatus, nerve, nuclei, or pathways, or the vestibulocerebellum, may produce nystagmus."
"In addition to horizontal nystagmus, there are also vertical and rotatory nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus may result following damage involving the superior vestibular nucleus in the pons. Extensive damage in the pontomedullary junction affecting the entire vestibular nuclear complex results in rotatory nystagmus."
"To test the functional integrity of the vestibular system, two clinical tests—the rotation test and the caloric test—may be performed. In the rotation test, the individual sits in a Barany chair with his head upright and tilted at 30° anteriorly. In this position the horizontal semicircular canals are oriented parallel to the plane of rotation."
"The individual is then rotated about 10 complete rotations to either the right or left, maintaining a continuous angular acceleration of the head. The rotation is then suddenly ceased. If, for example, the individual  is rotated to the right, the rotation will stimulate the right horizontal semicircular canal and then the stimulation will be transmitted to the right vestibular nuclei."
"The endolymphatic flow will tilt the cupula of the right horizontal semicircular canal to the left, due to the relative motion difference of the cupula and the endolymph. As rotation continues, the endolymph will “catch up” and flow at the same speed as the canal and head, which will no longer activate the cupula. Sudden stopping of the rotation causes the endolymph, due to its inertia, to continue flowing in the direction of rotation, tilting the cupula to the left, which will inhibit the hair cells."
"During rotation, the eyes will move slowly to the left  in order to maintain visual fixation, and then will flick back  to the center  . The nystagmus is in the direction of the spin, to the right. As the rotation is suddenly stopped, the direction of nystagmus is in the opposite direction , to that which occurs during rotation ."
"This is known as postrotatory nystagmus. Normally, postrotatory nystagmus lasts for about half a minute. In addition to the above reactions, the individual will lean or fall to the right  and experience vertigo  to the left ."
"If the subject is asked to point at a target, he will exhibit past pointing, in which the subject’s arm points in the direction of the rotation. Since nystagmus is named after the fast component, in this case it is to the right. The caloric test may be used to stimulate each vestibular apparatus, or specific semicircular canals, in conscious or unconscious individuals."
"The caloric test allows for the examination of the vestibular apparatus of only one side at a time. In a rotational test, on the contrary, both sides are stimulated simultaneously. For the caloric test, the horizontal canal has to be oriented in the vertical plane."
"To stimulate the horizontal canal, the subject sits upright with his head inclined about 60° posteriorly. The external auditory meatus is subsequently irrigated with SYNONYMS AND EPONYMS OF THE VESTIBULAR SYSTEM cold or warm water. The cold or warm temperature of the water produces vestibular apparatus fluid circulation currents."
"Cold water produces a sinking of the fluid, whereas warm water produces a rising of the fluid. In a subject with a normal vestibulo-ocular system, when the left ear is irrigated with cold water, flushing causes nystagmus  toward the opposite side , with accompanying past pointing and falling on the same side as the stimulation. When the same ear is irrigated with warm water, the nystagmus  is to the left ."
"If the subject is comatose, nystagmus is not observable. If the brainstem is undamaged, cold irrigation will cause both eyes to turn to the side of the cold irrigation. If the subject has a lesion affecting the MLF bilaterally, cold irrigation will cause the eye ipsilateral to the irrigation to turn toward the side of the cold irrigation."
"If there is a lesion in the caudal brainstem, affecting the vestibular nuclear complex, deviation of the eyes is not present. This patient has benign positional vertigo. This is the most common identifiable vertigo and it occurs most frequently in older individuals, although it can occur at any age."
"It is common and probably underdiagnosed. It is thought to be caused from free floating debris or particles in the endolymph of one of the semicircular canals, most commonly the posterior semicircular canal. Free floating particles are also derived from calcium carbonate crystals or otoliths."
"These crystals are normally associated with the macula in the utricle or the saccule and can at times become “dislodged and float in the endolymph. ”1 The cause of this pathology is unknown, but it is sometimes associated with trauma. This condition most often resolves on its own eventually, but can recur."
"Medications are often ineffective in the treatment of this condition. For a more complete description, please refer to the article by Furman and Cass. 1 The evaluation of dizziness requires that the patient describes exactly what he or she mean by dizziness."
"Dizziness can result from vertigo, which is an illusion of movement when there is actually no movement occurring. This is the same sensation produced when one is spun around and then suddenly stopped. The term dizziness is often used to refer to a vague sensation of imbalance, dysequilibrium, or light-headedness."
"This is often nonspecific and indeed non-neurologic. In contrast, vertigo is quite specific and usually indicates a problem either in the inner ear, the brainstem , and/or the cerebellum. If it is an inner ear problem, it is often associated with hearing loss and/or tinnitus."
"A 32-year-old male carpenter fell backwards off a ladder while at work about a month ago. His coworkers said that he hit the back of his head, but the patient does not remember this. He apparently lost consciousness for approximately 10 minutes, and was sent to the emergency room."
"A head CT performed in the ER was normal, including the sinuses. There was no apparent skull fracture. He recovered alertness and awareness and insisted on going home."
"Symptoms of headache and dizziness subsided after a few days. However, he has continued to experience a persistent loss of the sense of smell and taste since his accident. Food tastes bland, and he cannot fully sense odors such as coffee, freshly cut lumber, or his wife’s perfume."
"Examination shows his sense of smell to be greatly diminished when tested with several types of odiferous substances, in both nostrils. Taste sensation was normal for sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. Examination of the nose and sinuses was normal."
"The remaining general physical and neurologic exam was normal. The olfactory system mediating the special sense of smell is phylogenetically one of the most primitive sensory systems. Although humans do not rely to a great extent on their olfactory sense, the survival of many other animals is greatly dependent on olfaction."
"This is reflected in the relative size difference of the olfactory systems—that of humans being rather rudimentary compared with that of many other animals. In humans the olfactory epithelium consists of about 10 cm2 , compared to about 170 cm2 in dogs; dogs also have more than 100 times more receptors in each square centimeter than humans. The olfactory system is not only implicated in the perception and transmission of olfactory sensation, but is also believed to affect other neural systems associated with producing or influencing emotional, behavioral, and reflex responses such as reproductive and maternal behaviors, and autonomic visceral functions such as salivation, gastric secretion, and nausea."
"The ancestral cerebrum consisted of a pair of swellings, which received olfactory input from the olfactory bulbs and whose principal function was to mediate olfactory sensation. During evolution, the ancestral brain underwent modifications resulting in the enlargement and increased complexity of the cerebrum. These gradual changes were accompanied by the emergence and vast expansion of the neocortex with a consequent movement of the paleocortex to a more internal position at the base of the brain."
"Olfactory receptor cells, the first order bipolar neurons of the olfactory pathway, reside in the olfactory epithelium , and are the only neurons that are in direct contact with the environment. The nasal cavities are lined by a special membrane, the nasal mucosa, that is modified at the roof and the adjacent superior walls of these cavities into a specialized thick olfactory epithelium  and underlying connective tissue . This pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium includes several cell types, namely basal cells, immature receptor cells, olfactory receptor cells, and supporting cells."
The basal cells proliferate to form immature receptor cells that differentiate to become olfactory receptor cells. The supporting cells provide both physical and physiological support to all other cells of this epithelium. The olfactory receptor cells are first order afferent bipolar neurons that have a lifespan of about 1–2 months.
"These neurons are unique since they are the only nerve cells that come in direct contact with the environment. It was once thought that the olfactory receptor cells were the only nerve cells to retain the capability to regenerate throughout the lifetime of the organism. However, this is challenged by recent findings that adult neurogenesis also occurs in the dentate gyrus of the limbic system."
"The connective tissue  underlying the olfactory epithelium contains Bowman’s glands, whose ducts carry the gland’s aqueous secretion that forms a moist blanket on the epithelial surface. The remainder of the nasal mucosa produces a mucus secretion. The apical surface of the olfactory receptor cells possesses modified cilia, which are embedded in the mucus secretions."
"Odorous substances entering the nasal cavities dissolve in the moist layer of mucus and interact with receptor molecules embedded in the plasmalemma of the ciliary membrane, stimulating the chemosensitive cilia of the olfactory receptor cells. Most of the flavor that we “taste” in foods is actually the aroma that passes from the back of the mouth, reaching the superior recesses of the nasal cavity lined with olfactory epithelium. Odorous substances entering the nasal cavities dissolve in the moist mucus layer overlying the olfactory epithelium."
"These substances then interact with odorantbinding proteins immersed in the mucus layer. After diffusing through the mucus layer, the odorous substances interact with and bind to odorant-receptor protein molecules  embedded in the plasmalemma of the ciliary membrane, where transduction takes place. Each olfactory receptor cell contains about a dozen identical receptors , all of which are coded by one gene."
"Each olfactory receptor cell contains only one type of receptor, however this same type of receptor may also be exhibited by thousands of other olfactory receptor cells distributed throughout the olfactory epithelium. There are about 1,000 distinct olfactory receptors that make up the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors function in the detection of a wide range of odorous molecules."
"The binding of an odorous substance to the odorant-receptor protein molecules stimulates the initiation of a second messenger pathway associated with an olfactory-specific G-protein, which subsequently stimulates adenyl cyclase, which generates cAMP. The cAMP elevation unlocks a cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel embedded in the ciliary membrane permitting sodium and calcium cations to pass into the cell . This stimulates the chemosensitive cilia of the olfactory receptor cells and a wave of depolarization  is propagated from the dendrites to the cell body of the olfactory receptor cell."
"A high enough depolarization triggers a nerve impulse that is propagated along the axon of the olfactory receptor cell, centrally to the olfactory bulb. Each olfactory receptor cell gives rise to an unmyelinated centrally directed axon. They are the slowest impulse-conducting axons of the central nervous system ."
"The axons of these bipolar cells converge and assemble to form 15–20 bundles —the olfactory fila  . The olfactory fila course superiorly, traversing the sieve-like perforations of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone of the skull to terminate in the ventral surface of the ipsilateral olfactory bulb, where they synapse with second order neurons. Collectively, all the olfactory fila from each nasal cavity form the olfactory nerve  on both respective sides."
"The olfactory nerve fibers carry only special visceral afferent  modality, denoting the special sense of olfaction. The olfactory receptor cells are unique not only because they serve the functions of sensory receptors , transducers , and first order neurons , but also because they reside in a peripheral structure, the olfactory epithelium, instead of being housed within a sensory ganglion. In addition to the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation supplying the glands and blood vessels of the connective tissue, the olfactory mucosa also receives afferent sensory innervation from the trigeminal nerve."
"The free nerve endings of the peripheral trigeminal afferents ramify in the olfactory epithelium and the underlying lamina propria. Trigeminal fibers not only mediate pain sensations from the nasal mucosa, but are also believed to transmit noxious odor perception to subconscious levels, thus eliciting the autonomic secretomotor reflex in response to the presence of noxious chemicals . The olfactory bulbs are two oval-shaped, flattened structures located on the basal aspect of the frontal lobes, that are lodged in two fenestrated depressions formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone in the anterior cranial fossa."
"The two olfactory bulbs receive the central processes  of the first order olfactory receptor cells  whose terminations are organized and mapped in an orderly manner. This is the first relay station of the olfactory system where synaptic integration occurs . Since the olfactory bulbs are rostral dilations of the olfactory tracts, which are outgrowths of the telencephalon rather than typical cranial nerves, this first relay station of the olfactory system bypasses the diencephalon and is actually located in the cerebral cortex."
"The olfactory bulbs are laminated structures consisting of five layers surrounding a center of white matter. The layers are: the olfactory nerve layer, which is the most superficial, the glomerular layer, the external plexiform layer, the mitral cell layer, and the deepest layer, the inner plexiform layer containing granule cells. This laminated cellular architecture is more clearly defined in animals other than humans, reflecting the exquisite olfactory system that these animals possess."
"The center of white matter of the olfactory bulb consists of afferent fiber terminals , which have reached the bulb from other brain centers to modulate neural activity within the bulb, and efferent axons leaving the olfactory bulb via the olfactory tract to reach other cortical areas. Olfactory receptor cell axons are highly convergent as they terminate in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs. Glomeruli  are spherical synaptic complexes where olfactory receptor cell axons establish synapses with interneurons  and the main relay second order neurons of the bulb, the mitral and tufted cells."
Each olfactory receptor cell has an input to several dendritic processes  of a single mitral or tufted cell. In the rabbit each glomerulus receives up to a thousand converging olfactory receptor cell axons. Neural activity involving combinations of glomeruli is responsible for the perception of a “single” odor.
"That is, if several sets of dendrites are stimulated, the “odor” perceived is different than if only one of those sets of dendrites is stimulated. The juxtaglomerular and periglomerular interneurons modulate the transmission of the sensory afferent information from the olfactory receptor cells that is communicated to the mitral and tufted cells. These interneurons also control mitral and tufted cell output by regulating the stream of signals that reach other brain centers from the olfactory bulb."
"The olfactory bulbs also receive centrifugal fibers providing biofeedback input from neurons residing in other sites of the CNS. Centrifugal afferent fibers are projected to the olfactory bulb from the locus ceruleus, the medial and dorsal midbrain raphe nuclei, the medial septal nucleus, and the nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca. Each olfactory bulb also receives sensory input from the olfactory bulb of the opposite side, which is first processed in the contralateral anterior olfactory nucleus ."
"This input is believed to adjust the capacity of the second order neurons and interneurons to respond to incoming signals. Each olfactory tract arises from the olfactory bulb, courses posteriorly, and diverges to form the medial and lateral olfactory striae  . The two striae and a small region rostral to the anterior perforated substance collectively form a triangular-shaped region, the olfactory trigone."
"The principal fibers carried by the olfactory tract are the efferent axons of second order output neurons of the bulb —the mitral and tufted cells. Others include the afferent centrifugal fibers. Mitral and tufted cells occupying the olfactory bulb send collaterals to a cortical structure, the ipsilateral anterior olfactory nucleus located in the vicinity of the junction between the olfactory bulb and tract ."
"Efferent fibers arising from neurons of this nucleus accompany the efferent axons of the mitral and tufted cells coursing in the olfactory tract. The fibers arising from the anterior olfactory nucleus project to both olfactory bulbs; some of these fibers project to the nearby ipsilateral olfactory bulb, whereas others join the medial olfactory stria and cross via the anterior commissure to terminate in the contralateral olfactory bulb and anterior olfactory nucleus. The majority of the fibers coursing in the medial olfactory stria are derived from neurons housed in the anterior olfactory nucleus."
"The medial olfactory stria also carries fibers from mitral and tufted cells, which terminate in the ipsilateral anterior perforated substance and the medial septal nuclei. These nuclei form connections with the limbic system and are therefore implicated in the emotional and visceral response to odors . The lateral olfactory stria, consisting primarily of mitral cell axons, is the main central pathway of the olfactory system."
"Its second order fibers project mostly to paleocortical structures. The lateral olfactory stria, consisting of second order fibers, projects mostly to paleocortical structures and the amygdala. The paleocortical structures that are targets of the lateral olfactory stria consist of parts of the primary olfactory cortex  and the periamygdaloid cortex, which forms the rest of the olfactory component of the uncus and the amygdala ."
"Some fibers terminate in the lateral olfactory gyrus . However, most of the fibers terminate in the anterior half of the uncus forming part of the primary olfactory cortex located in the ventromedial aspect of the temporal lobe. Still other fibers terminate in the amygdala and the anterior perforated substance."
"The lateral olfactory stria also sends collaterals to the anterior olfactory nucleus and to subcortical limbic structures. The primary olfactory cortex  projects to the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects mainly to the orbital gyri of the orbitofrontal cortex of the frontal lobe . However, the primary olfactory cortex also sends direct projections to the neocortex and is the only sensory system that bypasses the thalamus in projecting to the telencephalon."
"The olfactory system neocortical projections terminating in the orbitofrontal cortex have an important function in the conscious awareness of odors. The neocortex functions as a correlating and coordinating center for the vast spectrum of sensory and motor input it receives from all sensory and motor systems . The primary olfactory cortex also projects to the hypothalamus, the amygdala, and the olfactory association cortex  located next to the primary olfactory cortex."
"The entorhinal cortex also receives direct projections from the olfactory tract. Functionally, the entrorhinal cortex is closely associated with the hippocampus, affecting memory and emotional behavior. Projections to the hypothalamus are associated with sexual and maternal behavior."
"Anosmia, the complete loss of the sense of smell, or hyposmia, the partial loss of the sense of smell, may result following injury to the olfactory apparatus, ipsilateral to the lesion. These conditions may occur subsequent to head trauma, especially if there is fracture or damage to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. In the event that the olfactory bulb becomes dislodged from its normal position, the delicate first order afferent fibers traversing the fenestrations of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone may be injured or torn."
"However, since these bipolar neurons retain the capacity to regenerate, they may successfully reconnect to the olfactory bulb and restore synaptic contacts in the appropriate layers of the bulb, resulting in the recovery of function and sense of smell. Other prevalent conditions such as rhinitis or sinusitis, resulting from irritation and/or swelling of the nasal mucous membrane, may temporarily disrupt olfaction. Moreover, exposure to various contaminants may adversely affect olfaction."
"Extensive damage may result in permanent loss of the sense of smell. Nasal congestion resulting from a cold or viral infection may also affect the sense of smell. A complete loss of olfaction is usually accompanied by a partial or complete loss of gustation , as commonly experienced during a bad cold when the individual is unable to taste food."
"Individuals with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex—the neocortex necessary for conscious awareness of odors—are able to detect the presence of odors but are unable to distinguish between different odorous substances. A viral or bacterial infection in the ears, air sinuses, or throat may spread to the upper recesses of the nasal cavities introducing infectious agents into the cranial vault. The meningeal membranes may subsequently become infected spreading the infection to the subarachnoid space and cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in meningitis, a serious and life-threatening inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes, the meninges."
"The upper recesses of the nasal cavity communicate with the cranial vault via perforations of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, which can serve as a conduit for the spread of infection, especially following head trauma involving the cribriform plate. Individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or Huntington’s disease, also experience a deterioration in olfactory function as a result of degenerating olfactory pathways. Individuals suffering from epilepsy may perceive odors that are not present or experience parosmia, a distorted perception of odors."
"In this case the etiology of the patient’s olfactory dysfunction is obvious: head trauma, which is a very common cause of olfactory dysfunction. Its cause is rarely of neurologic origin. The most common etiologies include upper respiratory infections, sinus disease, or any other nasal obstruction or congestion."
"Medications can induce loss of or alteration of the sense of smell. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or Huntington’s disease are also associated with loss of olfactory sensation. Most cases of olfactory loss caused by head trauma are thought to arise from shearing injury to the olfactory nerve fibers as they pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone."
"However, it can also arise from injury to the olfactory bulbs, olfactory tracts, or the frontal or temporal lobes. An individual is often unaware of unilateral loss of olfactory sensation in only one nostril but it becomes noticeable when the lesion is bilateral. Olfactory dysfunction occurs in approximately 5–10% of patients with head trauma."
"1 Loss of and/or alteration of the sense of smell can occur. There is some correlation between the severity of head trauma and the presence of, or the degree of, olfactory disturbance. 2 Patients with a loss of the sense of smell often complain of loss of, or alteration in, taste as well."
"However, loss of taste sensation to sweet, sour, salty, and bitter is much rarer than olfactory dysfunction. Trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal membranes detect irritants. Therefore, to only test olfactory function, nonirritating substances such as coffee or vanilla should be used."
Ammonia or vinegar are irritants and can be detected through the trigeminal nerve endings. Recovery of normal olfactory function in cases caused by head trauma is rare. There is no effective treatment.
"A 38-year-old woman complained to her primary care physician of two separate attacks during which she experienced fear and anxiety. These occurred suddenly without warning or precipitation by any circumstance. These episodes were brief, lasting a minute or so each."
She noted increasing levels of anxiety and irritability even in between these attacks. Friends and family were concerned about her increasingly “odd” behavior and unprovoked outbursts of anger. There were brief episodes during which she became incoherent.
"There was concern about panic attacks or even a more severe psychiatric condition such as schizophrenia. The patient had another attack that was witnessed by a friend. There was a sudden feeling of fear and anxiety as in the prior attacks, accompanied by agitation and crude verbalizations."
"This quickly progressed to loss of responsiveness and convulsive activity that lasted for less than a minute. After this episode she had a neurologic evaluation and testing. The limbic system consists of a diverse group of structures including phylogenetically ancient cortical areas, a group of associated subcortical nuclei, as well as associated pathways that interconnect regions of the telencephalon, diencephalon, and brainstem."
"A major function of the limbic system is to modulate the hypothalamus. As a result of its complex nature and widespread connections, the areas considered to constitute the limbic system are sometimes inconsistent among authors; however, the structures most commonly included under the limbic system are the cingulate, subcallosal, parahippocampal, and dentate gyri, the hippocampus proper, the subiculum, the amygdaloid body, the septal area, and some nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus . The two main structures of the limbic system are the hippocampal formation  and the amygdala."
"The hippocampal formation is involved in the consolidation of short-term memory into long-term memory, whereas the amygdala regulates emotional expression via modulation of the hypothalamus. An emotion  is an intense subjective sensation—including anger, distress, excitement, fear, happiness, hate, love, or sadness—that may be felt toward another individual or an object. The behavioral expression of emotions is usually accompanied by physiological  responses."
"Associated pathways such as the alveus, fimbria of the fornix, fornix, perforant pathway, cingulum, septohippocampal tract, ventral amygdalohypothalamic tract, mammillothalamic tract , mammillointerpeduncular tract, mammillotegmental tract, stria terminalis, and stria medullaris thalami, are also included in the limbic system . The limbic system, which is unique to mammals, functions in:  species preservation, which includes reproduction and associated instinctive behavior;  self-preservation, which includes feeding behavior and aggression; and  the expression of fear, motivation, and other emotions, as well as memory and learning. The limbic system not only exerts its influence on the expression of emotions, but also via its extensive connections with the hypothalamus ."
"This influences the corresponding visceral responses , which supplement the expression of emotion. The limbic system generates the emotional background for intellect. Furthermore, it serves to balance emotional and cognitive mechanisms."
"The limbic system, also referred to as the “visceral brain,” processes information about a certain situation and then, via its visceral control, produces visceral responses. What a person “knows” or “thinks” is mediated by the neocortex. Since the limbic system is involved in diverse functions and consists of intricate interconnections, it is often difficult to associate a particular component of the limbic system with a particular function."
"The limbic lobe   was characterized by Broca in 1878 as a composite of cortical structures  that formed a transitional border intervening between the centrally positioned diencephalon and the overlying telencephalon. The limbic lobe consists of the subcallosal, cingulate, and parahippocampal gyri, as well as the hippocampal formation, all of which collectively form a cortical perimeter around the corpus callosum. The subcallosal and parahippocampal gyri consist of neocortex ; the cingulate gyrus consists of mesocortex ; and the hippocampal formation consists of archicortex  ."
"Neocortex is phylogenetically new, whereas the archicortex consists of ancient cortex. The mesocortex is a transitional cortex positioned between the archicortex and neocortex. The limbic lobe is considered to be a component of the more extensive limbic system."
"The subcallosal gyrus consists of gray matter, which underlies the basal surface of the rostral extent of the corpus callosum . It curves superiorly around the genu of the corpus callosum and then extends posteriorly, superior to the corpus callosum, as the cingulate gyrus. At its posterior inferior extent, the cingulate gyrus in turn continues as the parahippocampal gyrus."
"The hippocampal formation consists of three regions, the hippocampus proper , the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum  . Structures associated with the hippocampal formation, via neuroanatomical connections, include the entorhinal cortex, the supracallosal gyrus , fasciola cinerea , and the septal area . The hippocampal formation extends from the amygdala anteriorly to the splenium of the corpus callosum posteriorly."
"On cross  section, its intrinsic structure is most striking in its middle third. The hippocampal formation consists of archicortex, which during the early stages of its development scrolls inferiorly and medially on the floor of the lateral ventricle . The function of the hippocampal formation in recent memory and learning is well established."
"The hippocampus proper  is a phylogenetically ancient cortical structure that forms a comma-shaped prominence on the floor and medial wall of the temporal  horn of the lateral ventricle. The hippocampus is an infolding of the cortex of the human brain, embedded within the parahippocampal gyrus of the temporal lobe. The ventricular surface of the hippocampus is coated with an ependymal layer."
"At its anterior extent, the hippocampus displays a swelling with several grooves resembling a paw, and is thus referred to as the pes hippocampus . The hippocampus extends from the amygdala anteriorly, and then tapers as it courses posteriorly to the inferior surface of the splenium of the corpus callosum. On coronal section , the hippocampus appears similar to a seahorse as a result of its arched form, thus its name."
"Due to its C-shaped outline in coronal section, the hippocampus also resembles a ram’s horn, and is called Ammon’s horn  after an Egyptian deity with a ram’s head. When viewed in transverse  section, the hippocampus , displays three zones: CA1, CA2, and CA3 . The hippocampus of the human brain also consists of an additional zone, CA4."
"Based on their cytoarchitectural characteristics, these zones are of importance to researchers. Area CA1 lies next to the subiculum, whereas CA3 lies close to the dentate gyrus. The hippocampal archicortex consists of three layers: the molecular, pyramidal, and polymorphic layers ."
"The molecular layer , which is located in the core of the hippocampal formation, consists of apical dendritic trees and axon terminals. The apical dendrites belong to hippocampal pyramidal cells . The axon terminals belong to granule cells whose cell bodies reside in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the perforant pathway arising in the entorhinal cortex, the septohippocampal tract arising from the septal area, and the pyramidal cell axon collateral branches, arising from the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus."
"This layer merges with the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the neocortex. The pyramidal layer is the most prominent layer of the hippocampal formation and consists of pyramidal cells. Their dendrites ramify in the molecular layer, whereas their axons pass in the opposite direction, across the polymorphic layer, and then course in the alveus, fimbria, and the fornix."
"Pyramidal cell axon collateral branches, referred to as Schaffer collaterals, cross the polymorphic and pyramidal layers to reach the molecular layer where they form synaptic contacts with the dendrites of other pyramidal neurons. The pyramidal layer of the hippocampal formation merges with the internal pyramidal layer of the neocortex. The polymorphic layer  shares structural characteristics with the deepest layer of the neocortex."
"This layer lies deep to the alveus and consists of interneurons, as well as pyramidal cell dendrites and axon collateral branches. The dentate gyrus   is a notched band of cortex that is interposed between the upper aspect of the parahippocampal gyrus and the fimbria. This gyrus gets its name from its tooth-like configuration created by numerous blood vessels that pierce the ventricular surface of the hippocampus and then the dentate gyrus, which imparts a notched appearance."
"Dorsally, the dentate gyrus courses along with the fimbria near the splenium of the corpus callosum where it extends to the indusium griseum. Anteriorly, the dentate gyrus extends to the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus. Similar to the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus also consists of three layers of archicortex."
"They are an outer molecular layer, a middle granule cell layer , and a deep polymorphic layer . The molecular layer of the dentate gyrus archicortex consists mainly of a small population of nerve cell bodies and granule cell dendrites. The granule cell layer consists of the cell bodies of the granule cells, the most predominant cell type of the dentate gyrus."
"The dendritic arborizations of the granule cells ramify in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus where they form synapses with the terminals of the perforant pathway. The axons of the granule cells , give rise to collateral branches, then exit the dentate gyrus, pass into the molecular layer of the hippocampus as mossy fibers and terminate on the dendrites of the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is the only target of the dentate gyrus output."
A large number of the collateral branches project to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. An area of the dentate gyrus known as the hilus merges with the polymorphic layer of the CA3 zone of the hippocampus. The hilus consists of interneurons and granule cell axons.
A cross-section of the hippocampal formation exhibits a perceptible double interlocking C. This salient characteristic of the hippocampal formation results from the interlocking of the prominent pyramidal layer of the hippocampus proper and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus archicortex consists of interneurons.
"The subiculum is a transitional zone that displays a threelayered archicortex next to the hippocampus, but progressively becomes a more elaborate six-layered neocortex as it approaches the parahippocampal gyrus. The subiculum receives information relayed by the hippocampal pyramidal cells. It gives rise to fibers that join the fornix and terminate in the mammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus."
The entorhinal cortex  is located ventral to the amygdaloid body and the anterior half of the hippocampal formation. The entorhinal cortex exhibits distinguishing characteristics in two of its layers  that are visible at light microscopy level. Layer II contains the cell bodies of large multipolar neurons that assemble to form multiple “islands” throughout this layer.
"Since this layer is close to the cortical surface, the cell islands protrude from the surface of the entorhinal cortex, appearing as tiny swellings, resembling the texture of lemon peel. These swellings are visible grossly. Unlike layer II, layer IV of the entorhinal cortex includes a dense fiber plexus that forms a distinct boundary between layer III, containing small pyramidal cells, and layer V, containing large pyramidal cells."
Widespread areas of the association cortex relay input to the entorhinal cortex and it is via the entorhinal cortex that these cortical association areas have access to the hippocampus and play a role in memory consolidation. The entorhinal cortex gives rise to the most prominent input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation via the perforant pathway arising from the lateral part of the entorhinal cortex and the alvear pathway arising from the medial part of the entorhinal cortex. These pathways are part of the intrinsic circuitry of the hippocampal formation.
"The indusium griseum  represents a portion of the hippocampal formation that remained attached to the corpus callosum during its development, as the rest of the hippocampal formation moved laterally, inferiorly, and then medially to its final position in the temporal lobe . Dorsally, it curves around the splenium of the corpus callosum and then merges with the dentate and parahippocampal gyri by way of the fasciola cinerea. Two pairs of rudimentary stripes of indusium griseum white matter, the medial and lateral longitudinal striae arise and terminate in the hippocampal formation, and course bilaterally along the superior surface of the corpus callosum, lateral to the indusium griseum."
"The fasciola cinerea   is a transitional zone of intervening cortex that joins the dentate gyrus with the indusium griseum . The septal area is located in the telencephalon, in close proximity to the genu of the corpus callosum. This area, which is well developed in humans, includes the septal nuclear complex whose nuclei are gathered rostral to the anterior commissure."
"The septal nuclei are classified into two main groups, the medial and lateral septal nuclei, which are analogous with the deep telencephalic nuclei rather than the cortex. They are connected with the hippocampal formation via the fornix, and the hypothalamus via the medial forebrain bundle. Furthermore, the septal nuclei send fibers via the stria medullaris thalami to the habenular nucleus."
"Afferent fibers to the hippocampus proper arise from the following sources : the indusium griseum, cingulate gyrus, septal nuclei, the entorhinal cortex, the dentate gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the contralateral hippocampus. Efferent fibers of the hippocampus proper  arise mostly from the pyramidal cells of its pyramidal cell layer. Their axons course in the alveus, fimbria, and fornix, which distributes them to various nuclei."
"Axons coursing anterior to the anterior commissure terminate in the septal nuclei, the lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, and the anterior part of the hypothalamus. Axons coursing posterior to the anterior commissure are distributed to the mammillary body, the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus, and the tegmentum of the mesencephalon. Some hippocampal fibers terminate in the habenular nuclei."
"A second pathway, the hippocampo-entorhino-neocortical pathway, emerges from the hippocampus proper and follows the perforant path back to deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex and from there to the neocortex . This pathway is involved in the consolidation of episodic memories. The components of the hippocampal formation  serve as successive processing stations in a series of local projections within the hippocampal formation."
"This local circuit consists of a pathway that arises from the entorhinal cortex. Although the intrinsic circuitry of the hippocampal formation consists primarily of a closed loop of signal transmission, collateral branches and feedback connections are also present along this pathway, which serve to modify the relay of signals within the hippocampal formation . Axons arising from the entorhinal cortex  form the perforant and alvear pathways , which end in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where their fibers synapse with the dendrites of its granule cells."
"Furthermore, these axons also send collaterals to the CA1 and CA3 zones of the hippocampus and the subiculum. The entorhinal cortex provides the major input to the hippocampal formation. The granule cells of the dentate gyrus give rise to axons referred to as mossy fibers, which project not only to the CA3 zone of the hippocampal formation where they synapse with pyramidal cells, but also to its own polymorphic layer."
"The dentate gyrus polymorphic-layer neurons give rise to fibers that synapse with the dendrites and cell bodies of the granule cells, modifying the information relayed by the granule cells. Note that the dentate gyrus projects only locally, and does not project outside the hippocampal formation. The pyramidal cells of the CA3 zone give rise to axons that join the fimbria."
"Prior to joining the fimbria, these axons emit Schaefer collaterals that project within CA3, and to the CA1 zone of the hippocampal formation , as well as to the septal nuclei. The pyramidal cells of the CA1 zone send their axons to the subiculum . The subiculum in turn projects to the deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex, completing a closed circuit."
The cells in the deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex in turn give rise to axons that project to the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex. The superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex then give rise to the perforant pathway. The entorhinal cortex also gives rise to a prominent projection to neocortical association areas.
"Widespread areas of the cerebral cortex project to the entorhinal cortex, which in turn relays this input to specific areas of the hippocampal formation. Association  connections link different areas of the hippocampal formation, whereas commissural fibers link the hippocampal formation of the two sides. The Papez circuit was proposed by James Papez in the 1930s as the neuroanatomical basis of emotion."
"Although it is known today that the connections of the limbic system are much more complex, this circuit served as a basis for more modern research. The Papez circuit consists of the following anatomical structures: the hippocampus, fornix, mammillary body, anterior nucleus of the thalamus, mammillothalamic tract, and cingulate gyrus. The hippocampal formation sends fibers via the fornix to the mammillary body, and other nuclei of the hypothalamus."
"The mammillary body sends the majority of its output fibers via the mammillothalamic tract to the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the cingulate gyrus. The cingulate gyrus projects back via the cingulum to the hippocampal formation, completing the circuit. This circuit, though, is not a closed one, since each relay station has numerous connections with other areas of the nervous system."
"Learning is the manner by which knowledge is acquired, and memory is the process by which knowledge is stored and is retrievable in the future. Memory is classified very broadly into immediate, short-term, and long-term memory. Newly learned information is initially stored into immediate or short-term memory, lasting for seconds and minutes, respectively."
"Recently learned information, if reinforced, may be conveyed and stored into long-term memory for a prolonged period of time, a function which is mediated by the hippocampal formation. Individuals who have lesions in the hippocampal formation are unable to transfer immediate and short-term memory into long-term memory. Learning and memory processes may be interrupted by trauma, cerebral anoxia, Alzheimer’s disease, and amnestic confabulatory syndrome  involving the hippocampus."
"Recent studies indicate that the mechanism by which short-term memory is assembled/converted into long-term memory may be long-term potentiation, a form of neuronal plasticity. Long-term potentiation is a physiological process that occurs at neuronal synaptic contacts, as follows. When a neuron transmits a succession of nerve impulses to another neuron, this persistent/continual stimulation increases the probability that the target neuron will be depolarized by this particular synapse and by additional synaptic contacts established on the target neuron."
"Depolarization of the target neuron may be due to a higher chance that neurotransmitter will be released by the presynaptic terminal and/or an enhanced response of the postsynaptic terminal. Long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation has been established at the axon terminals of the perforant pathway , and at the axon terminals of the CA3 zone pyramidal cells forming synaptic contacts on CA1 zone cells. Recall that the perforant pathway consists of cortical association fibers that emerge from the entorhinal cortex, and migrate to the molecular layers of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus, where they synapse with pyramidal and granule cells, respectively."
"Long-term potentiation may be the physiological process via which certain types of memory are formed. The amygdala   is an almond-shaped group of nuclei located deep to the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus anterior to the hippocampus and the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The amygdala is divided into three groups of subnuclei : the large basolateral  group, and the smaller corticomedial  and central groups."
"The basolateral and corticomedial subnuclei receive afferent fibers, whereas the central group subnuclei give rise to efferent fibers. Each subnucleus has different connections and functions. The amygdala receives sensory input from widespread areas of the nervous system including somatosensory, visual, auditory, and visceral  stimuli."
"The corticomedial  nucleus is the oldest phylogenetically. This nucleus is the termination of olfactory fibers arising from the olfactory bulb via the lateral olfactory stria, and the olfactory cortex. Since this nucleus projects to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, it is believed to play a role in eating behaviors."
"The basolateral  nucleus is the newest phylogenetically. It is reciprocally connected to the cortical sensory association areas of all four lobes  and projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the basal nucleus , and the ventral striatum. This nucleus influences the various functions of the hypothalamus associated with feeding and drinking behavior, autonomic and somatic reflexes, and responses to stress."
"The basolateral and corticomedial nuclei project to the central nucleus. This nucleus has reciprocal connections with the visceral sensory and visceral motor nuclei located in the brainstem. The central nucleus gives rise to the ventral amygdalofugal pathway, which terminates in the autonomic nervous system nuclei of the brainstem."
"These include the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, as well as nuclei of the reticular formation involved in respiratory and cardiovascular functions. The amygdala receives afferent  fibers from the following sources : olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, basal forebrain, medial thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. One of the principal functions of the limbic system is to modulate hypothalamic activity, and this modulation is mediated via two main output pathways arising from the amygdala, which distribute fibers mainly to the hypothalamus, but also to sources of amygdalar input."
"These efferent pathways are: the stria terminalis  and the ventral amygdalofugal  pathway  . The latter pathway is less distinct, and distributes fibers from the central nucleus to the brainstem as well as fibers from the basolateral nucleus that terminate in the thalamus, ventral striatum, and basal nucleus. The signals arising from the striatum are ultimately relayed to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices."
"The limbic system projections to the deep cerebral nuclei are associated with underlying emotional aspects that influence movement. One of the key roles of the amygdala is the control of autonomic nervous system  function in relation to previous experiences. ANS modulation is mediated indirectly by reciprocal projections between the amygdala and the hypothalamus , which in turn coordinates ANS activity, and directly via the descending pathways that arise from the amygdala and terminate in the brainstem autonomic centers ."
"The mode of amygdaloid control on ANS function differs from that of the hypothalamus . Hypothalamic control of ANS activity is reflex in nature, continuously monitoring the body’s internal environment via baroreceptors and osmoreceptors, and making appropriate adjustments, whereas control of ANS activity by the amygdala is mediated by instinct. The amygdala utilizes prior experiences to modulate ANS activity."
"The basolateral nucleus has abundant reciprocal projections with the sensory association areas of all four lobes and is associated with the processing of input related to past experiences. In contrast, the corticomedial nucleus projects to the hypothalamus, whereas the central nucleus projects to the brainstem. The amygdala, through its connections with the hypothalamus, influences the visceral and somatic aspects that correspond to the behavioral expression of emotion."
"Various emotional states initiate intricate psychological, endocrine, and autonomic responses. The limbic system sends numerous projections to the hypothalamic nuclei, especially the mammillary and preoptic nuclei . The hypothalamus in turn mediates ANS  responses that accompany the expression of emotions."
"The amygdala and hypothalamus project to the “limbic nuclei” of the thalamus, which include the anterior nuclear group and the lateral dorsal and medial dorsal nuclei of the thalamus . These nuclei then relay this information to the limbic lobe. Furthermore, the hippocampal formation receives afferent fibers from the anterior, lateral dorsal, lateral posterior, and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus."
"The limbic system projects to the reticular formation of the mesencephalon via a relay in the habenular nuclei. These nuclei project to the interpeduncular and raphe nuclei of the mesencephalon via the habenulointerpeduncular tract. Other habenular efferent fibers terminate in the hypothalamus, the ventral tegmental area, and the substantia nigra."
"The ventral tegmental area of the midbrain modulates the processing of memory via dopaminergic fibers that terminate in cortical areas related to the limbic system. The locus ceruleus sends noradrenergic fibers whereas the dorsal raphe sends serotonergic fibers to the hippocampal formation, limbic lobe, and amygdala, where they modulate the processing of memory. A number of pathways connect the various components of, and areas associated with, the limbic system ."
"They are the alveus, fimbria, fornix, perforant pathway, cingulum, septohippocampal tract, ventral amygdalohypothalamic tract, mammillothalamic tract , mammillointerpeduncular tract, mammillotegmental tract, stria terminalis, stria medullaris , anterior commissure, diagonal band of Broca, and habenulointerpeduncular tract. Deep to the ependymal layer overlying the ventricular surface of the hippocampal formation, there is a fine layer of white matter, the alveus . The alveus is composed of a two-way bundle of myelinated axons, most of which belong to the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal formation."
"These axons gather to become the fimbria , which extends to the subsplenial area inferior to the corpus callosum. At the subsplenial area each hippocampus  proceeds as the crus of the fornix  . The fornix consists of two crura, one on each side, which are joined by commissural fibers forming the commissure of the fornix ."
"Anterior to the commissure of the fornix, the two crura approach one another and unite in the midline to become the body of the fornix. The body of the fornix courses anteriorly following the inferior edge of the septum pellucidum. At the level of the interventricular foramen  and the anterior commissure, the fornix becomes arched, proceeding inferiorly and posteriorly diverging again into the columns of the fornix."
"As each column turns inferiorly on each side, it dives into the lateral wall of the third ventricle and then enters the mammillary body of the hypothalamus. At the level of the anterior commissure, the fornix separates into a precommissural part that lies anterior to the anterior commissure, and a postcommissural part that lies posterior to the anterior commissure. The precommissural fibers take their origin primarily from the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus  and project to the septal area and basal forebrain."
"The postcommissural fibers emerge from the subiculum, and then enter the hypothalamus where the majority of the fibers project primarily in the mammillary nucleus. Some fibers also terminate in the thalamus and other nuclei of the hypothalamus. The fornix is the main output pathway of the hippocampal formation relaying information to the hypothalamus and the septal nuclei."
"Although most of the axons in the fornix are efferents to the ipsilateral hypothalamus and the septal area, some of the fibers are afferents to the hippocampus from various brain centers. In addition, the fornix carries commissural fibers to the habenular nuclei, and others connecting the hippocampal formation of the two sides. Through its connections with the hypothalamus  and with the temporal lobe, the hippocampus can influence emotional behavior and memory, respectively."
"The perforant pathway  is the main cortical input pathway to the hippocampal formation. It consists of cortical association fibers that emerge from the entorhinal cortex, and migrate to the molecular layers of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus, where they synapse with pyramidal and granule cells, respectively. The cingulum consists of cortical association fibers located on the deep aspect of the cingulate gyrus."
"It transmits information that interconnects the surrounding neocortex. The septohippocampal tract carries fibers that arise from the medial septal nucleus and the nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca. These fibers join the fornix to terminate in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex next to the hippocampal formation."
"The ventral amygdalohypothalamic tract is the main projection pathway from the amygdala to the hypothalamus, which it reaches by traversing the internal capsule. The mammillothalamic tract is the principal output pathway arising from the hypothalamic mammillary nucleus. It consists of heavily myelinated axons that terminate in the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus."
"The mammillointerpeduncular tract arises from the mammillary body and terminates in the interpeduncular nucleus. The mammillotegmental tract arises from the mammillary body and terminates in the midbrain tegmentum. Fibers of the stria terminalis take their origin mainly from the amygdaloid body and terminate in the septal area, the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis."
"The stria medullaris  consists of fibers that interconnect the habenular nucleus with the septal nuclei and the anterior hypothalamus. The anterior commissure carries decussating fibers transmitting olfactory information between the olfactory bulbs, as well as information between the parahippocampal gyri. The diagonal band of Broca consists of fibers that arise from the parolfactory area and terminate in the periamygdaloid area in the temporal lobe."
The habenulointerpeduncular tract arises from the habenular nucleus and terminates in the interpeduncular nucleus of the mesencephalon. Bilateral lesions of the hippocampus may be produced during a forceful impact of the anterior poles of the temporal lobes on the greater wings of the sphenoid bone. Injury to the temporal lobes results in the inability to form new memories.
Studies have shown that the pyramidal neurons in area CA1 of the hippocampal formation  are particularly susceptible to cell injury and death if blood oxygen concentration drops to low levels. Cell degeneration within CA1 occurs within 3–4 minutes as a consequence of the decrease in oxygen supply that occurs following a cardiac arrest to individuals who are resuscitated. Injury to the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal formation results in memory loss.
"Bilateral lesion or removal of the medial temporal lobe including the amygdala and most of the hippocampal formation, has been performed in the past on individuals who have epileptic seizures. The hippocampus has an exceptionally low threshold for epileptic seizures, which may be transmitted to other parts of the limbic lobe and to the neocortex. Although this surgical treatment reduces the occurrence of seizures in these individuals, they are unable to learn anything or to form new memories, a condition referred to as anterograde amnesia."
"In addition, removal of the hippocampi results in retrograde amnesia, a condition in which there is a deficit in more recent memories, but not of those in the distant past. These findings have led to the conclusion that the hippocampal formation is necessary in the formation of long-term memories. It is believed that the hippocampus generates the drive and mediates the translation of short-term into long-term memories, which are stored in the neocortical association areas ."
"Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the brain and is the most common form of progressive dementia in the elderly. Individuals with this disease are unable to form new memories. This disease is caused by pathologic alterations, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuronal degeneration, which appear initially in the pyramidal cell islands  of the entorhinal cortex."
"From there, degeneration spreads to the CA1 zone of the hippocampus proper, and then back to the deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex. Consequently, this neuronal degeneration hinders the normal flow of information through the hippocampal formation. Confusion and deficits in executive function occur following further spread of neurofibrillary tangles to the temporal pole and prefrontal cortex."
"Subicular pathology occurs roughly at the same time that neurofibrillary tangles invade the temporal neocortex. Amnestic confabulatory syndrome is a disorder that most often results from thiamin  nutritional deficiency in chronic alcoholism. Affected individuals have loss of recent memory, and to compensate for this when they converse, they make up fictitious information or events to fill in the gaps of memory loss."
"Morphological changes are reported in the hippocampal formation, the columns of the fornix, and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. However, the area that exhibits the most drastic modification is the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Experiments performed on monkeys with bilateral temporal lobe lesions, which included the amygdala as well as the surrounding cortical areas that project to the amygdala, produced what is referred to as the Klüver Bucy syndrome."
"This syndrome, however, is rare in humans, and the following description refers to the original experimental findings. The most striking behavioral characteristics of this syndrome are: lack of fear and anger in previously wild animals, docility, changes in feeding behavior, sexual abnormalities, excessive oral curiosity in examining objects, and visual agnosia . This patient initially had symptoms of a psychiatric disturbance and seemed to display some elements of psychosis."
"However, she then had another episode that began like the previous attacks but then clearly became a seizure. The knowledge that she had a seizure shifts the whole scheme of diagnostic possibilities. A seizure work-up was performed, including an electroencephalogram  and magnetic resonance imaging  of the brain."
The EEG showed epileptiform activity coming from the left anterior temporal region. The MRI revealed an astrocytoma in the left anteromedial temporal lobe. The patient underwent resection of the tumor.
"There were subsequently no more seizures and many, but not all, of her other psychological symptoms improved. Psychological symptoms are very common in epilepsy. They often occur as an aura preceding the onset of more characteristic manifestations of seizure."
"However, the aura in this case is actually the beginning of the seizure. Fear, anxiety, anger, disorientation, bizarre behavior, altered perception, a feeling of déjà vu, and agitation are some of the more common manifestations. Psychological or emotional symptoms are associated with temporal lobe seizures, especially involving the anteromedial temporal lobe, and sometimes frontal lobe seizures."
"In fact, the most epileptogenic regions of the brain are the temporal and frontal lobes, especially the limbic regions. Thus epilepsy with emotional or psychological manifestations is occasionally confused with psychiatric disease. Patients with epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy, sometimes display bizarre behaviors or personality or have psychological disturbances even between the seizures."
"This can occur in patients with lesions, such as tumors, in specific regions of the brain or even in patients without such lesions. This leads to the hypothesis that the temporal lobe, specifically the medial temporal lobe, may be structurally or physiologically abnormal even if no lesion is detected there. Very fine resolution MRI imaging of the temporal lobes, using coronal images, often shows medial temporal sclerosis in those with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy."
This shows up as subtle scarring and loss of volume of the parahippocampal gyri. There is a loss of neurons and gliosis in the hippocampus and to a variable degree in the surrounding structures. A 23-year-old woman complains of daytime sleepiness and poor sleep at night.
"Sometimes she has an uncontrollable urge to sleep during the daytime. When she feels sleepy, she takes 5–15-minute naps and feels somewhat refreshed upon awakening. These episodes occur a few times per week."
"She has also noticed that occasionally her body feels somewhat limp and her head drops. These episodes last only a few seconds and seem to be prompted by laughing, getting very angry, or excited. A few times she has noticed brief episodes of complete paralysis while lying in bed at night prior to falling sleep."
"Sometimes she has strange and occasionally frightening visual hallucinations before she drifts off to sleep at night. She usually wakes up a few times each night. Her most disabling symptom is the daytime sleepiness, which interferes with her ability to concentrate."
These symptoms began several years ago. Family history is negative. She is not taking any medications or drugs.
"The general physical and neurologic exam is normal. MRI of the brain is normal. The hypothalamus, a subdivision of the diencephalon, weighs approximately 4 g, and forms less than 1% of the brain’s total weight."
"Although this small region of the brain may seem trivial, it is, on the contrary, the center of numerous, and various, very important functions associated with the survival of the organism, and continuation of the species. The hypothalamic functions that are crucial to the survival of the organism include the control of appetite, fluid balance, electrolyte balance, glucose concentration, metabolism, sleeping, and body temperature regulation. In addition, hypothalamic function is associated with the continuation of the species, since it plays a role in sexual behavior."
"The hypothalamus mediates these functions by integrating the functions of the endocrine, autonomic , somatic motor, and limbic systems. The hypothalamus maintains homeostasis, a state of constant internal environment , and responds to both neural and non-neural stimulation. The hypothalamus consists of a group of nuclei each playing a role in one or more of the above functions."
"Some nuclei consist of neurons that receive and respond to neural input from widespread areas of the nervous system. Other nuclei consist of neurons that respond to non-neural input, such as fluctuations in the temperature, osmotic pressure, and hormone levels of the circulating blood. During stressful situations, however, this state of equilibrium may be disturbed."
"The body is equipped with receptors that detect changes in various physiological systems. The hypothalamus in turn, through its connections with the endocrine, autonomic, and limbic systems, mediates corrective mechanisms that compensate for the imbalance, and aid the body in restoring physiological equilibrium. Furthermore, through its extensive interconnections with the limbic system, the hypothalamus plays an important role in memory and emotional behavior, and mediates the appropriate visceral responses, such as changes in heart rate and blood pressure, accompanying behavioral expression."
"For example, an individual who is feeling anxious, experiences an increase in heart rate and breathing. The following structures form the borders of the hypothalamus : anteriorly, from superior to inferior, the anterior commissure, lamina terminalis, and optic chiasma; posteriorly, the interpeduncular fossa; superiorly, the hypothalamic sulcus; inferiorly, the tuber cinereum , medially, the third ventricle, and laterally, the substantia innominata, subthalamic nucleus, and internal capsule. The hypothalamus is divided sagittally from medial to lateral into periventricular, medial, and lateral zones for descriptive purposes ."
"Two prominent, heavily myelinated fiber bundles associated with the hypothalamus—the mammillothalamic tract and the column of the fornix—form a conspicuous boundary between its medial and lateral zones . The periventricular zone is located next to the midline, and consists of numerous, rather small, and difficult to delineate nuclei that line the wall of the third ventricle along the anterior–posterior extent of the hypothalamus. The nuclei of this zone are the periventricular, suprachiasmatic, and arcuate nuclei ."
"The periventricular and arcuate nuclei control the functions of the anterior pituitary gland , which synthesizes and releases various endocrine hormones into the bloodstream. The suprachiasmatic nucleus functions in the control of circadian rhythms, and is referred to as the “master clock” of the body. The nuclei located in this zone are in an approximate anterior to posterior sequence, the medial preoptic, anterior hypothalamic, paraventricular, supraoptic, dorsomedial, ventromedial, mammillary, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei ."
"The nuclei in this zone control the functions of the autonomic nervous system and the secretory activity of the posterior pituitary gland . The lateral zone contains the lateral preoptic nucleus anteriorly, the lateral tuberal nuclei in the tuberal region, and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, which extends throughout the anterioposterior extent of the lateral zone . In addition, this area also contains the longitudinally oriented fibers of the medial forebrain bundle."
"This zone contains nuclei that receive information from the limbic system and mammillary bodies and then relay this input to other hypothalamic nuclei and the brainstem. This zone plays an important role in the behavioral expression of emotions. In general, the hypothalamic nuclei are often difficult to identify since their boundaries are not sharply delineated from adjacent nuclei, as they are in other parts of the central nervous system ."
"In order to define their location more precisely, the hypothalamus is, in addition to being divided sagittally into three mediolateral zones, further divided coronally into four regions in a rostrocaudal sequence. These four regions, which are located near three prominent anatomical structures visible on the ventral surface of the brain , are the preoptic region, supraoptic  region, tuberal  region, and mammillary  region. Each of these regions contains nuclei as described below; however, some nuclei may extend into the adjacent zones and regions ."
"The preoptic region, although located at least in part anterior to the lamina terminalis in the telencephalon, has been accepted in recent years as the anterior telencephalic portion of the hypothalamus . It consists of gray matter located in the anteriormost extent of the third ventricle, both anterior and posterior to the plane of the lamina terminalis. Due to the similarities of its connections and functions to those of the anterior part of the medial region of the hypothalamus, the preoptic area is grouped with the anterior hypothalamus."
"The preoptic area extends into the periventricular, medial, and lateral zones. It contains the preoptic and periventricular nuclei in the periventricular zone, the medial preoptic nucleus in the medial zone, and the lateral preoptic nucleus in the lateral zone. The preoptic region controls the release of reproductive hormones from the adenohypophysis."
"There is sexual dimorphism evident in this region, reflecting the different function it has in the male and female. In the female, the anterior pituitary gland releases gonadotropin hormones that ultimately regulate the menstrual cycle, whereas in the male, the pituitary releases gonadotropins continually. The supraoptic region is located dorsal to the optic chiasma, is continuous rostrally with the preoptic area, and contains six nuclei."
"They are, from medial to lateral, the suprachiasmatic and periventricular nuclei in the periventricular zone, the anterior hypothalamic, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei in the medial zone, and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus in the lateral zone. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is a small nucleus located next to the midline, dorsal to the optic chiasma, adjacent to the third ventricle. This nucleus receives visual information via axons arising from the retina  as they course through the optic chiasma, and functions in the control of circadian rhythms."
"This nucleus is referred to as the “master clock” of the body. The anterior hypothalamic nucleus  is located dorsal to the supraoptic nucleus, and is involved in temperature regulation. The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei  have the most abundant blood supply in the brain."
"The neurons of these two conspicuous nuclei synthesize the neurohypophyseal hormones, antidiuretic hormone  and oxytocin. These hormones are transported via axons arising from neurons housed in these nuclei to the posterior lobe  of the pituitary gland. These unmyelinated axons gather to form the supraopticohypophyseal  tract, which courses in the infundibular stalk, and then terminate in the neurohypophysis."
"The paraventricular nucleus controls water balance by functioning in the conservation of water. In addition to the magnocellular cell group, which projects to the neurohypophysis, the paraventricular nucleus also houses other groups of neurons. One of these groups of cells, the parvocellular group, projects to the median eminence, whereas another group of cells projects to the reticular formation and the autonomic centers of the brainstem and spinal cord."
"The tuberal region is located dorsal to the tuber cinereum and contains the following main nuclei. They are the arcuate  nucleus in the periventricular zone, the dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei in the medial zone, and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus in the lateral zone. The arcuate  nucleus is located in the periventricular zone, in the tuber cinereum, arching under the ventral aspect of the third ventricle."
"The cells of this nucleus produce hypothalamic-releasing hormones, and their axons form the tuberohypophyseal tract that caries these hormones to the infundibulum, where they pass into the hypophyseal portal system. The hypophyseal portal system in turn controls anterior pituitary gland  hormone release into the general circulation. The dorsomedial nucleus, when stimulated, produces aggressive behavior in animals."
"The ventromedial nucleus is a “satiety center,” which upon stimulation results in satiety. This nucleus contains cells that are sensitive to blood glucose levels, and which are believed to monitor caloric intake. The lateral hypothalamic nucleus is involved in the control of appetite."
"When stimulated, it induces eating. The mammillary region includes the prominent mammillary nuclei and the posterior hypothalamic nucleus. Three to four mammillary nuclei collectively form each mammillary body."
"The mammillary bodies appear as two conspicuous elevations on the ventral surface of the hypothalamus. Unlike the other hypothalamic nuclei, which are associated with functions of the endocrine and/or autonomic nervous systems, the mammillary nuclei are a major target projection area of the hippocampal formation via the fornix, relaying input related to emotions. In addition, information is relayed to the mammillary nuclei via the mammillary peduncle from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei as well as from the raphe nuclei."
The mammillary nucleus relays input to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus via the prominent mammillothalamic tract. The posterior hypothalamic nucleus contains cells that are sensitive to a decrease in the temperature of the blood. This nucleus serves as a “thermostat” and regulates body temperature by conserving heat and stimulating heat production.
"Heat is conserved by vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, whereas heat is produced by an increase in thyroid activity and shivering. The hypothalamus is connected with widespread regions of the nervous system. It receives input related to emotion from the limbic system, as well as input from sensory and motor nuclei from the brainstem and spinal cord."
"The hypothalamus exerts its influence via its outputs on the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. The hypothalamus receives afferent fibers  from various structures, however most neural input arises from the limbic system. Other fibers arise from visceral structures and the brainstem."
"Fibers arise from the following sources: the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, septal area and septal nuclei, ventral striatum, midline and medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, retina, dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, raphe nuclei, locus ceruleus, spinal cord, and reticular formation. In addition to the neural input, the hypothalamus also receives non-neural input from the vascular system. Hypothalamic neurons serve as receptors that are sensitive to rapid changes in the temperature, osmotic pressure, and hormone levels of the circulating blood."
"These receptors are referred to as circumventricular organs . Although there are six circumventricular organs, only two are associated with the hypothalamus. They consist of hypothalamic neurons that are embedded in the wall of the third ventricle, and are sensitive to alterations in the chemical composition of the cerebrospinal fluid."
"One of these structures is associated with the lamina terminalis, and is referred to as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis . The OVLT is a chemosensory structure that detects and responds to peptides and macromolecules present in the bloodstream. The other CVO is the subfornical organ located inferior to the fornix, near the interventricular foramen."
"The subfornical organ serves in the regulation of body fluids. The fenestrated capillaries supplying these receptors do not have a blood–brain barrier, thus they permit substances present in the bloodstream to pass through and enter the extracellular space surrounding the receptor cells. Most hypothalamic output projections terminate in the sources of hypothalamic input."
"The hypothalamus projects efferent fibers  to the following structures: the septal area and septal nuclei, medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, anterior nucleus of the thalamus, hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, midbrain reticular formation, and brainstem and spinal cord autonomic nuclei. In addition to the neural output, the hypothalamus also provides output to the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis. The hypothalamus exerts its influence on the endocrine system via these two projections."
"Hypothalamic influence is exerted on the endocrine system directly, via the fibers of the supraopticohypophyseal tract, which terminates in the posterior lobe of the hypophysis . There these neurons release hormones that pass into the capillaries of the neurohypophysis and then enter the bloodstream. The hypothalamus also exerts its influence on the endocrine system indirectly, via the local capillary networks of the hypophyseal portal system, which carries hormones synthesized by the hypothalamus to the adenohypophysis ."
"The pathways connecting the hypothalamus with other regions of the nervous system are categorized into afferent or efferent pathways based on the direction of most of the information that they carry. However, none of them carry exclusively afferent or efferent fibers since they all carry information that is bidirectional . The fornix is a myelinated tract that arises from the hippocampal formation of the limbic system and conveys the most prominent neural input to the hypothalamus."
"It distributes fibers to the preoptic and anterior areas of the hypothalamus, and then proceeds through the hypothalamus to terminate mostly in the medial nucleus of the mammillary body posteriorly. he mammillary peduncle carries prominent sensory input from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of the mesencephalon as well as from the raphe nuclei to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The stria terminalis  transmits information from the amygdaloid nuclear complex to the medial preoptic area and the anterior nucleus of the hypothalamus."
"This pathway transmits olfactory information, which is believed to affect reproductive behavior. The thalamohypothalamic tract carries fibers from the medial dorsal and midline nuclei of the thalamus to the lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The ventral amygdalohypothalamic tract relays amygdaloid signals from the basolateral nucleus to the lateral hypothalamic nucleus where they influence autonomic nervous system activities."
"The retinosuprachiasmatic tract consists of a bundle of fibers arising from the retina that terminates in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is involved in the control of circadian rhythms. The spinohypothalamic fibers, a component of the anterolateral system of the ascending sensory pathways, consist of axons arising from the spinal cord that relay nociceptive input to the autonomic control centers of the hypothalamus."
"There they synapse with neurons that give rise to the hypothalamospinal tract, which is associated with the autonomic and reflex responses  to nociception. Most of the nociceptive fibers from the spinal cord ascending in the anterolateral system of the ascending sensory pathways, and the fibers of the trigeminothalamic tract, send collateral branches to the reticular formation as they ascend through the brainstem. There these collateral branches activate the ascending reticular activating system , which relays information to the cerebral cortex alerting the individual, but also relays information to the hypothalamus, limbic system, and serotonergic raphe nucleus magnus."
"The hypothalamus mediates the autonomic and reflex responses to nociception, the limbic system mediates the emotional/ behavioral responses to nociception, and the raphe nucleus is involved in descending control of pain. The fasciculus mammillaris princeps arises from the mammillary body and then quickly bifurcates to give rise to the mammillothalamic and mammillotegmental tracts. The mammillothalamic tract is a myelinated bundle of fibers that arises from the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei and terminates in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus."
The mammillotegmental tract is a component of the medial forebrain bundle. It carries mammillothalamic tract axon collaterals from the lateral mammillary nuclei to the midbrain dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei in the reticular formation. The mammillointerpeduncular tract carries fibers from the mammillary nucleus that terminate in the interpeduncular nucleus.
"The interpeduncular nucleus plays a role in the sleep–wake cycle. The supraopticohypophyseal tract is a short tract consisting of axons that carry oxytocin or vasopressin, synthesized in the cell bodies of hypothalamic neurons residing in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, to the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Oxytocin and vasopressin are synthesized in different populations of hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons."
"The secretory substances are transported via these axons to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland . Upon stimulation, the hypothalamic neurosecretory cells transmit impulses to their terminals, which results in the release of the hormones into the general circulation. The periventricular bundle consists of fibers that connect the periventricular zone nuclei with the frontal cortex, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the medulla, the lateral cell column at T1 to L2, and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus of the spinal cord."
"The functions of the projections to the brainstem and spinal cord are autonomic system responses. The tuberohypophyseal tract carries fibers from the arcuate and periventricular nuclei to the infundibular stalk and the anterior pituitary. The axon terminals of the tuberohypophyseal tractrelease “releasing hormones” or “releaseinhibiting hormones” in the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland where they regulate the synthesis and release of anterior pituitary hormones."
The tuberohypophyseal tract and the hypophyseal portal system serve as a connection between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. The dorsal longitudinal fasciculus carries fibers that connect various regions of the CNS. Among these fibers are some that arise from the hypothalamus and descend to terminate in the brainstem and spinal cord autonomic nuclei.
"In addition, this pathway carries signals from the hypothalamus to the reticular formation. These signals are then relayed via the reticulobulbar tract to the brainstem lower motoneurons, and via the reticulospinal tract to the spinal cord lower motoneurons. By way of the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus, the hypothalamus ultimately influences chewing, swallowing, and shivering."
"The hypothalamospinal tract carries fibers arising mainly from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Additional fibers originate from the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and posterior nuclei. These fibers descend to terminate in the brainstem and spinal cord to synapse directly with preganglionic sympathetic  and parasympathetic  nuclei neurons."
"These direct projections to the spinal cord are small in number; the majority of the descending fibers from the hypothalamus that are destined to influence the autonomic centers are believed to synapse at multiple relay centers. The medial forebrain bundle is not really a distinct bundle as its name implies, but instead consists of a vast array of axons with various origins and terminations. It includes both afferent and efferent fibers to and from the hypothalamus."
"The afferent fibers to the hypothalamus arise primarily from the septal area. Other fibers arise from the basal forebrain and primary olfactory cortex, as well as from the brainstem raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, and locus ceruleus. Efferent fibers arising from the hypothalamus and running in the medial forebrain bundle terminate in the septal area, septal nuclei, and brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei, as well as in the autonomic nuclei of the spinal cord."
"These fibers are believed to play a role in motivation and sense of smell. The medial forebrain bundle is more prominent in other animals with a keen sense of smell. The stria medullaris thalami carries afferent and efferent fibers to and from the hypothalamus, connecting its supraoptic nucleus and preoptic area with the habenula."
"The habenula is visible in a midsagittal section of the brain, in the medial surface of the thalamus near its caudal end. It appears as a small swelling rostral to the pineal gland, above the posterior commissure. It contains the habenular nuclei and its function is not known."
"The hypothalamus functions in the regulation of body temperature, food intake, fluid intake, and control of the autonomic nervous system . It also plays a role in emotional expression, memory, and aggression. Temperature-sensitive receptors  located in the skin detect information about the environmental temperature."
"Other peripheral temperature-sensitive receptors  detect information about the body’s core temperature. Both environmental and body core  temperature input is relayed to higher brain centers, including the hypothalamus, via the ascending sensory pathways. In addition to the peripheral temperature-sensitive receptors, the preoptic region and anterior hypothalamic nuclei house two types of temperature-sensitive  neurons that respond to very slight temperature changes  of the blood."
"One group of these neurons becomes stimulated by increases in blood temperature, whereas another group of neurons becomes stimulated by decreases in blood temperature. The hypothalamus is a well vascularized brain center. As the circulating blood percolates in the capillary bed surrounding the thermosensitive preoptic and anterior hypothalamic neurons, these neurons become stimulated by warming or cooling of the blood."
"It is believed that the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic nuclei initiate heat loss mechanisms, whereas the posterior hypothalamic nuclei activate heat conservation and heat production mechanisms . Thus the hypothalamus serves as a “thermostat” that mediates mechanisms that enable the body to return to, and maintain, a normal body temperature. Temperature regulation involves hypothalamic integration of autonomic, endocrine, somatic motor, and limbic system activities."
"For example, in response to an increase in body temperature, the anterior hypothalamus triggers the appropriate body responses that will result in a decrease in body temperature. These responses include autonomic activities such as sweating and cutaneous vasodilation, and a decrease in somatic motor function. Furthermore, behavioral changes such as seeking a cooler environment or taking off a sweater to reduce body temperature may be appropriate."
"The neurons that control the parasympathetic nervous system are located in the anterior nucleus of the hypothalamus to mediate the parasympathetic responses associated with decreasing body temperature. In response to a decrease in body temperature, the posterior hypothalamus triggers the appropriate body responses that will produce an increase in body temperature. These responses include:  piloerection  and the vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, both of which are mediated by the autonomic nervous system to conserve body heat;  an increase in metabolism  by the anterior lobe of the pituitary), mediated by the endocrine system to increase body heat;  shivering, mediated by the somatic motor system to produce heat; and  behavioral  responses, such as turning the heat on, putting on warmer clothes, and drinking something warm, mediated by the limbic system to increase body temperature."
Frontal lobe connections to the limbic system mediate behavioral changes to optimize conditions for homeostasis. The neurons that control the sympathetic nervous system are located in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus. These neurons send their axons to the lateral horn of the spinal cord to mediate the sympathetic responses associated with increasing body temperature.
"While body temperature may be regulated by the hypothalamus and associated physiological processes, the temperature range in which these processes are effective is rather slight. For example, the hypothalamus cannot keep the body at a normal temperature range in an extremely cold environment. In the past, the lateral and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus were believed to be associated with eating behavior."
"Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic nucleus in experimental animals induced eating, and it was referred to as a “hunger” or “feeding center. ” Stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus inhibited eating, and was referred to as a “satiety center. ” It is now known that things are not as simple as were once believed."
"In addition to the lateral and ventromedial nuclei, the paraventricular nucleus also plays a role in the regulation of food intake , possibly through its projections to the brainstem reticular formation, as well as to the brainstem and spinal cord autonomic nuclei. However, the precise mechanism of food intake regulation is unknown. The lateral hypothalamic nucleus contains a group of neurons that synthesize orexins  , which are hypothalamic neuropeptides that not only regulate food intake but also the sleep–wake cycle."
"Fasting causes an increase in orexin synthesis, whereas administration of exogenous orexin induces eating. Orexin is also involved in waking and keeping an individual awake throughout the day. At night, hypothalamic orexin production decreases, causing an individual to fall asleep."
"A group of cells located lateral to the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, known as the zona incerta, are believed to play a role in water intake. Stimulation of the zona incerta results in the drinking of large amounts of water. The hypothalamus receives visceral input via the ascending sensory system and input related to emotions from the limbic system."
"The hypothalamus in turn exerts its influence on both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, coordinating their functions in order to maintain homeostasis or to produce the appropriate visceral responses that accompany behavioral expression. Stimulation of the anterior  and medial hypothalamus controls the activities of the parasympathetic nervous system . Parasympathetic responses include: pupillary constriction, increase in salivary secretion, decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, increase in intestinal peristaltic waves, vasodilation, sweating, piloerection, and urinary bladder contraction."
"Stimulation of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus controls the activities of the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic responses include: pupillary dilation, decrease in salivary secretion, increase in heart rate and blood pressure, decrease of peristaltic waves, vasoconstriction of cutaneous blood vessels, and urinary bladder relaxation. Although fibers destined for the control of autonomic centers  of the brainstem and spinal cord arise from various hypothalamic nuclei, the principal source of these hypothalamic descending fibers is the parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus."
"Interestingly, some of the paraventricular neurons project to both parasympathetic and sympathetic centers. It is important to realize that fibers arising from the anterior and medial hypothalamic nuclei pass posteriorly and laterally on their way to the brainstem and spinal cord. Thus stimulation of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus may not only stimulate the local neurons that project to the sympathetic centers, but also those fibers arising from the anterior and medial hypothalamus that pass by the posterior and lateral hypothalamus, which are destined for the parasympathetic centers."
"Fibers arising from the posterior and lateral hypothalamus synapse with the preganglionic sympathetic neurons at the T1 to L2 levels of the spinal cord to elicit the appropriate sympathetic responses. Fibers arising from the anterior and lateral hypothalamus synapse with the parasympathetic neurons at the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the S2–S4 parasympathetic nucleus to elicit the appropriate parasympathetic responses. Emotions trigger the relay of a heavy input from the limbic system to the hypothalamus."
"The hypothalamus in turn, via its connections with the autonomic nervous system, mediates the appropriate visceral responses  accompanying behavioral expression. For example, a student who is feeling anxious before an examination, may experience an increase in heart rate, breathing rate, have sweaty palms, and a dry mouth, all of which are responses mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. The magnitude of the visceromotor responses to emotions depends on the individual, his prior experiences, and his ability to control his emotions and the consequent visceral responses at the neocortical level."
"The hippocampus, a region involved in learning and memory, gives rise to a prominent fiber bundle, the fornix, which among other targets, projects to the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. Hippocampal input to the hypothalamus is involved in the influence of memories on emotion. Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus not only induces eating and drinking behaviors in animals, but also causes the animal to become more active, and even exhibit aggressive behavior or rage."
"Stimulation of the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus and surrounding areas produces satiety and tranquility. The hypothalamus regulates pituitary gland functions. Hypothalamic influence on the pituitary gland, and ultimately on the endocrine system, travels via two paths: a neural path and a non-neural  path."
"The pituitary gland , consists of two lobes, the anterior and posterior lobes. The anterior lobe is also referred to as the adenohypophysis  due to its glandular properties, whereas the posterior lobe is also referred to as the neurohypophysis due to its neural properties. Hypothalamic influence on the pituitary gland, and ultimately on the endocrine system, travels via two paths: a neural path and a non-neural vascular path."
"In the neural path, hypothalamic control is exerted on the neurohypophysis via a neural pathway, the hypothalamohypophyseal  tract. The axon terminals of this pathway release hormones in the extracellular space, which then pass directly into fenestrated capillaries of the posterior pituitary, which in turn empty into the general circulation . In the non-neural path, hypothalamic control is exerted on the adenohypophysis via a vascular network, the hypothalamic portal system."
"This path involves the release of hypothalamic hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, a vascular network confined to the hypothalamopituitary region, which connects the hypothalamic and pituitary vascular beds, and which carries these hormones to the anterior pituitary. The appropriate cells of the anterior pituitary then release hormones into the general circulation . The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the medial zone of the hypothalamus house the large cell bodies of hypothalamic neurosecretory cells ."
"These cells are neurons since they have both the morphological characteristics of neurons and upon stimulation transmit nerve impulses down their axons. In addition, these cells also have endocrine properties since they produce hormones  that are released into the bloodstream. Thus they are considered to be specialized neurons."
"The profuse vascularization of the hypothalamus enables the neurosecretory cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei to sample the osmolarity of the blood flowing through the hypothalamus. The neurosecretory cells are stimulated even by a slight increase of osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers the relay of nerve impulses down their axons. The neurosecretory cells synthesize two peptide hormones, antidiuretic hormone  and oxytocin."
"Only one of these hormones is synthesized by any one  cell, and both hormones are synthesized by the  cells of both nuclei. Each of these hormones is synthesized as a prohormone in the cell body of the neurosecretory cells. Each of these hormones then becomes bound to a carrier protein known as a neurophysin and is then transported within vesicles , down the axons of these neurosecretory cells, which gather to form the supraopticohypophyseal tract."
"Although these axons arise from both the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, most arise from the supraoptic nucleus and thus the tract is named the supraopticohypophyseal tract. This tract descends only a short distance to terminate in the median eminence, infundibular stalk, and posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These hormones are either stored in the axon terminals or are released and then pass into the blood circulation."
"Hormone release is triggered when nerve impulses are transmitted to the axon terminals of the neurosecretory cells of the supraopticohypophyseal tract. The axon terminals are expanded and form a direct contact with the fenestrated capillary wall. These terminals then liberate ADH, which passes into the fenestrated capillaries and then flows into the general circulation."
"Unlike other nerve cells, those residing in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei do not establish synaptic contacts with other nerve cells. Instead, their function is to detect alterations in the chemical composition of the blood. When these cells are stimulated, they liberate their hormones into the bloodstream."
"The ADH released by these nerve terminals passes into the capillary bed of the median eminence, infundibular stalk, and posterior lobe of the pituitary to gain entrance into the general circulation. When the water content of the body is low, the amount of ADH released into the bloodstream is increased. ADH acts on the kidney’s distal and collecting tubules causing them to reabsorb water from the tubule lumen, until the water content of the body is restored to normal, resulting in minimal water loss in the urine."
"When the body’s water content is high, only small amounts of ADH are released into the bloodstream. In response to the decreased ADH blood levels, the kidney reabsorbs less water, resulting a dilute urine and water loss. By altering the volume of water lost in the urine, the kidney controls the osmotic pressure in the blood."
"Thus this hormone enables the body to conserve water and regulate body fluid content. The ADH also acts on the smooth muscle of the vessel wall. It causes contraction of the smooth muscle, which results in a decrease in lumen diameter and a consequent elevation in blood pressure."
"In addition, ADH is also released in response to a decrease in blood volume as would result following hemorrhage. Pressure receptors are located in the carotid artery and aortic arch, while stretch receptors are located in the walls of the left atrium and pulmonary veins. These receptors relay this sensory input to the brainstem medulla via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves."
"From there, input is relayed via ascending fibers to the supraoptic nucleus. The oxytocin released by the nerve terminals, like ADH, also passes into the capillary bed of the median eminence, infundibular stalk, and posterior lobe of the pituitary, to gain entrance into the general circulation. Oxytocin  has two functions."
"It causes contraction of the uterine myometrium during the final stages of pregnancy, which facilitates parturition, and contraction of the mammary gland myoepithelial cells, resulting in milk ejection of the active mammary gland. Small cells located in the arcuate nucleus and other periventricular zone nuclei of the hypothalamus synthesize various releasing hormones  and releaseinhibiting hormones  . The releasing hormones produced by the hypothalamus are: • somatotropin-releasing hormone , which stimulates the release of somatotropin ; • prolactin-releasing hormone , which stimulates the release of prolactin; • corticotropin-releasing hormone , which stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropin; • gonadotropin-releasing hormone , which stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone  and folliclestimulating hormone ; • thyroid-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone , which stimulates the release of TSH; and • melanocyte-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone, which releases melanocyte-stimulating hormone ."
"The release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus are: • somatostatin, which inhibits growth hormone  and TSH release; • prolactin-inhibitory factor , which inhibits the release of prolactin; and • melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibitory factor , which inhibits melanocyte-stimulating hormone  release. These releasing or inhibiting hormones are packaged into vesicles that flow down the axons of these neurons, which collectively form the tuberohypophyseal  tract, and are released in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk. There they pass into a capillary plexus that gives rise to portal veins that carry these releasing or inhibiting hormones to the anterior pituitary gland."
"The adenohypophysis contains cells that synthesize and, when appropriately stimulated, release into the general circulation the following trophic hormones: GH , prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone , FSH, LH, interstitial cell-stimulating hormone  in males, TSH , and MSH. These hormones are released into the bloodstream and are carried to their target organs  where they bind to receptors on cells and stimulate  the release of hormones produced by the respective organs. The pituitary gland receives its blood supply mainly from two vessels; the superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries ."
"The superior hypophyseal artery is a branch of the internal carotid or the posterior communicating artery, and supplies the hypophyseal stalk and the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The inferior hypophyseal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery, and supplies the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Branches of the superior hypophyseal artery drain into a capillary plexus in the median eminence and upper part of the infundibular stalk."
"This plexus in turn drains into venules, which drain into long portal veins that descend in the infundibular stalk to the adenohypophysis where they branch into another capillary plexus. Both of these plexuses consist of fenestrated capillaries. These capillaries then drain into the nearby cavernous sinus."
"The hypothalamus is a small region of the brain and a lesion confined to only a single nucleus is uncommon. Instead, a hypothalamic lesion usually extends into a number of nuclei, affecting their function and resulting in more than one symptom. Hypothalamic lesions may result following skull fractures involving the sphenoid bone, cerebrovascular accidents, or most commonly, pituitary tumors."
"Depending on the nucleus or nuclei damaged, symptoms result from the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, water intake, food intake, temperature regulation, and sexual behavior. The preoptic and anterior hypothalamic nuclei are involved in the control of body temperature. In the event that body temperature rises above normal limits, these nuclei initiate heat loss mechanisms in order to restore normal body temperature."
"Bilateral destruction involving these nuclei results in hyperthermia, an elevation in body temperature. The presence of infectious agents in the body results in the production of pyrogens which may enter the bloodstream and eventually reach the hypothalamus. The pyrogens pass through the fenestrated capillaries of the anterior hypothalamus and contact the hypothalamic receptor cells of the circumventricular organs."
"In response to this contact, the body’s thermostat is changed to a higher temperature point, thus the body’s temperature becomes elevated above normal. This is accomplished by inhibition of heat loss mechanisms, cutaneous vasoconstriction, and shivering. Cutaneous vasoconstriction results in the lowering of the body’s surface temperature, which is perceived as a cold sensation, usually accompanying a fever."
"The posterior hypothalamic nuclei are also involved in the control of body temperature. In the event that body temperature drops, they initiate mechanisms that will conserve and produce heat to restore body temperature. Bilateral destruction involving the posterior hypothalamic nuclei results in the inability to regulate body temperature  regardless of the environmental temperature."
"The reason for this phenomenon is that when the cells of the posterior nuclei are damaged, the fibers arising from the anterior hypothalamic nuclei are also damaged as they course through the posterior hypothalamic nuclei on their way to their destination. The lateral and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus are involved in eating behavior. The lateral hypothalamic nucleus contains a group of neurons that synthesize orexins  , which are hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate food intake and the sleep–wake cycle."
"Stimulation of the lateral nucleus  induces eating, whereas stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus  inhibits eating. Fasting causes an increase in orexin synthesis, whereas administration of exogenous orexin induces eating. A lesion in the lateral nucleus results in aphagia  and a drastic drop in body weight."
"A bilateral lesion in the ventromedial nucleus results in hyperphagia  and excess body weight. Undetectable or low levels of orexin  production is associated with narcolepsy, a disorder in which an individual falls asleep suddenly, several times during the day and at inopportune times. Studies show that the hypothalamus of an individual suffering from narcolepsy contains only onetenth of the normal number of neurons that produce hypocretin."
"It is believed that narcolepsy may be caused by deficient hypocretin neurotransmission in some individuals. A lesion involving the cell group lateral to the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, known as the zona incerta, results in a lack of interest in water intake. This may result in severe dehydration and death."
"The anterior and posterior hypothalamic areas are associated with the control of the autonomic nervous system. A lesion involving the anterior hypothalamic nucleus will result in the disruption of parasympathetic activities, whereas a lesion involving the posterior hypothalamic nucleus will result in the disruption of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. The reason for this is that although the posterior hypothalamic nucleus is involved in the control of the sympathetic nervous system, fibers arising from the anterior nucleus course through the posterior nucleus on their way to their destination."
"Thus a lesion in the posterior nucleus will damage local hypothalamic neurons controlling sympathetic activities and fibers passing through the nucleus controlling parasympathetic activities. Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus not only induces eating and drinking behaviors in animals, but also causes animals to become more active, and even exhibit aggressive behavior or rage. Bilateral lesions in the lateral hypothalamus cause a lack of interest in eating, drinking, and extreme passivity of the animal."
"Stimulation of the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus and surrounding areas produces satiety and tranquility. Bilateral lesions of the ventromedial areas of the hypothalamus induce excessive eating, drinking, excitability, and aggression. Damage to the anterior hypothalamus may result following the compression of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei by a growing tumor at the ventral aspect of the brain."
"The cells of this nucleus produce ADH , which acts on the kidney tubules to conserve water. As a result of nuclear damage, an inadequate amount of ADH results in diabetes insipidus. This condition is characterized by polydipsia  and polyuria ."
"Diabetes insipidus may also result following damage of the tuberoinfundibular tract. This is a hormonal-type diabetes insipidus, as opposed to the renal type where the renal tubules are incapable of responding to plentiful circulating ADH. This patient has narcolepsy."
"Narcolepsy is a condition which causes abnormal sleep patterns. It is almost always an acquired disease and symptoms typically begin in older childhood or young adulthood. The most common symptom is daytime sleepiness, which often leads to “sleep attacks."
"” Nighttime sleep is often of poor quality, so the total sleep time during a 24-hour period is often normal. Some of the most characteristic and notable symptoms arise secondary to the intrusion of REM  states into waking hours. REM is a stage of normal sleep in which there is paralysis of all the muscles except those controlling eye movements and respiration."
"Dreams often occur in REM sleep. This intrusion of REM into waking hours accounts for episodes of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Cataplexy refers to brief episodes of loss of muscle tone, which is brought about by intense emotions such as laughing or anger."
"This can cause falls or, in cases where it is just partial, a head drop or jaw drop. It can cause extreme social embarrassment. Sleep paralysis refers to brief episodes of complete paralysis, which can occur just before sleep onset or upon waking from sleep."
"Hypnagogic hallucinations are hallucinations, commonly visual and sometimes frightening, which occur before the onset of sleep  or upon waking from sleep . Narcolepsy can be confirmed by a multiple sleep latency test . An abnormally short onset of sleep  and an abnormally quick onset of the REM stage of sleep confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy."
"A regular sleep study should be performed to look for other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness, such as obstructive sleep apnea. The cause of narcolepsy has recently been determined. The posterior hypothalamus contains neurons that contain orexin ."
"These neurons project widely, including to the cerebral cortex and brainstem. Orexin mediates wakefulness and alertness, and it has been demonstrated that a lack of orexin in animals, or an alteration of the orexin receptors, leads to symptoms reminiscent of narcolepsy. It is thought that there is a selective absence of these orexincontaining neurons in the posterior hypothalamus in narcolepsy."
"1 The etiology of this condition is unclear. The sleepiness and sleep attacks are treated with stimulants such as amphetamines or methylphenidate. A new medication for this, which has less abuse potential and side effects, is modafinil."
"Cataplexy can be treated with tricyclic antidepressants or similar medicines, which promote the effects of amines such as norepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin. These medications inhibit REM sleep. A 68-year-old hypertensive male had sudden onset of headache and complete loss of sensation of his left face, arm, and leg."
This began 10 hours before admission to the emergency room. He had no other complaint. His blood pressure in the ER was 230/120.
"Other vital signs were relatively normal. Brief examination in the ER confirmed sensory loss on the left side of his body, with normal strength. Movements on the left were not well coordinated."
"He was able to ambulate quite well. An urgent head CT was performed, which was diagnostic. Information arising from the basal ganglia, cerebellum, limbic system and sensory systems  is relayed to the thalamus, a subcortical relay station."
"Here, this information is processed and integrated and is then transmitted to specific areas of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. These cortical areas are in turn connected via reciprocal feedback projections to the thalamic subnuclei, making the cerebral cortex the most prominent input source to the thalamus. The thalamus not only functions in the further processing and integration of sensory and motor information, but also serves as the main entrance, via which this and additional information reaches the cerebral cortex."
"Therefore, the thalamus not only controls the flow of numerous streams of information to the cerebral cortex for additional processing but, ultimately, regulates cortical activity. Although the thalamus projects mainly to the cerebral cortex, it also provides input to the basal ganglia and the hypothalamus. The thalamus has an anterior and posterior pole, and four surfaces."
"Its boundaries are: anteriorly, the interventricular foramen ; posteriorly, the posterior extent of the pulvinar; medially, the third ventricle; laterally, the posterior limb of the internal capsule; dorsally, its free surface, which contributes to the floor of the lateral ventricle; and ventrally, the hypothalamic sulcus on the lateral wall of the third ventricle, separating it from the hypothalamus . The thalamus   is an oval-shaped mass of gray matter, embedded deep within the white matter of each cerebral hemisphere. Although the right and left thalami are separated along most of their medial surface by the narrow, vertically oriented third ventricle, a short, narrow, cylindrical structure—the interthalamic adhesion , which traverses the third ventricle—forms a bridge between them."
"Although the interthalamic adhesion connects the right and left sides of the brain, it is not considered to be a true “commissure” since this structure consists of gray matter only, and has no decussating fibers. The interthalamic adhesion is present in the majority of brains; however, its function is unknown. The stria medullaris thalami and the stria terminalis, two thin strands of white matter, lie on the superior surface of the thalamus ."
"The stria medullaris thalami courses on the superomedial margin of the thalamus, separating its superior from its medial surface. It is a slender bundle of twoway fibers connecting the septal nuclei and hypothalamus with the habenular nucleus of the epithalamus. The stria terminalis carries fibers primarily from the amygdala, which terminate in the hypothalamus, septal area, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis."
"It courses on the superolateral surface of the thalamus, separating its superior surface from its lateral surface and from the body of the caudate nucleus. The lateral aspect of the superior surface of the thalamus contributes to the floor of the lateral ventricle and the medial aspect of the superior surface of the thalamus displays a groove formed by the fornix. The thalamus rests on the mesencephalon, thus its inferior surface forms a ceiling over the mesencephalic tectum ."
"Numerous tracts such as the medial lemniscus and the trigeminothalamic, rubrothalamic, reticulothalamic, and dentatothalamic  tracts, ascend through the brainstem and pass into the thalamus from its inferior surface. In addition, the brainstem reticular formation extends superiorly into the thalamus through this surface. The internal medullary lamina, a Y-shaped layer of white matter, partitions the thalamus into three main groups of nuclei, the anterior, medial, and lateral groups, based on their relative position ."
"The posterior portion of this lamina, the leg of the Y, separates the medial from the lateral thalamic nuclear groups. Its anterior portion, which is divided into two limbs, partially surrounds the anterior nuclear group, and separates it from the neighboring medial and lateral nuclear groups. The internal medullary lamina contains afferent and efferent thalamic fibers that enter or leave the thalamic subnuclei."
"The external medullary lamina is a curved layer of white matter that follows the contour and covers mostly the anterior and lateral surfaces of the thalamus. It is composed of myelinated thalamocortical fibers that originate in the thalamus and terminate in the cerebral cortex, and of reciprocal feedback corticothalamic fibers that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the thalamus. The external medullary lamina is covered by a slender layer of gray matter, the thalamic reticular nucleus, which is the most lateral  nucleus of the thalamus ."
"The myelinated thalamocortical fibers arising from the thalamus pass through the external medullary lamina, and radiate from the lateral surface of the thalamus, collectively forming the thalamic radiations. These fibers become incorporated in the various parts of the internal capsule and the corona radiata as they ascend to terminate in the cerebral cortex. Corticothalamic fibers also course through the corona radiata and the internal capsule, and when they approach the thalamus they converge to pass through the external medullary lamina to terminate in the various thalamic subnuclei."
"Based on their afferent and efferent connections, each thalamic nuclear group functions as an independent unit and serves a particular function . The nuclear groups are further divided into subnuclei, and the role of each thalamic subnucleus is associated with the source of incoming afferents, and the cortical target areas of its efferents . With the exception of the thalamic reticular nucleus, all thalamic subnuclei possess thalamic projection neurons that relay processed information to the cerebral cortex."
"In addition, the thalamic subnuclei also have inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acid -ergic interneurons whose cell bodies and processes are confined to a single subnucleus. Although a number of classifications exist, this textbook uses the most common of these and subdivides the subnuclei into anterior, medial, and lateral nuclear groups. The anterior and medial nuclear groups are phylogenetically the older thalamic nuclei and are collectively referred to as the paleothalamus."
"The subnuclei of the lateral nuclear group are newer, and are referred to as the neothalamus. Additionally, because of their unique characteristics, two of the thalamic nuclei—the intralaminar and reticular nuclei—are usually not included in any of the three thalamic nuclear groups listed above, but instead are grouped separately. The anterior nuclear group consists of a composite of three subnuclei: the anteroventral , anteromedial , and anterodorsal  subnuclei."
"The subnuclei of the anterior group are wedged in the anterior tubercle of the thalamus, which forms an elevation on the anterior part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle. This is the smallest thalamic nuclear group, and due to the comparable connections and roles of its three subnuclei, they are collectively referred to as the anterior nuclei of the thalamus. The anterior nuclear group, a relay nucleus of the Papez circuit of emotion, has a significant number of connections with the limbic system."
"It receives afferent fibers relaying information from the mammillary body of the hypothalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, and the hippocampal formation via the fornix. It in turn projects to the cingulate gyrus of the limbic association cortex. Due to its limbic connections, the anterior nuclear group functions in the expression of emotions, and due to its considerable connections with the hippocampal formation, this group of nuclei is also believed to be associated with learning and memory processes."
"The anterior nuclei are also associated with attention. The medial nuclear group includes the more prominent dorsomedial nucleus , as well as the diffuse midline nuclei  that are located on the most medial surface of the thalamus  and within the interthalamic adhesion. It should be noted that some authors classify the midline nuclei as a separate group of nuclei ."
"The DM nucleus functions in the processing of information related to emotion. It is subdivided into the parvocellular and magnocellular divisions. The parvocellular division has reciprocal connections with the prefrontal association cortex, which functions in the integration of sensory information associated with higher order cognitive function."
"As part of the association loop of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra project to the ventral anterior and the DM nuclei of the thalamus. These nuclei in turn project via thalamocortical fibers to the prefrontal cortex. The magnocellular division is associated with limbic system components such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex."
"Additionally, the DM nucleus has extensive connections with the olfactory system, the hypothalamus, and the intralaminar, midline, and lateral posterior subnuclei of the thalamus. The midline nuclei function in the modulation of cortical excitability. They include the dorsal midline nuclei, which are associated with the striatum and the limbic cortex, and the ventral midline nuclei, which are associated with the hippocampus."
"The lateral nuclear group is interposed between the internal and external medullary laminae, and consists of numerous subnuclei that collectively form the largest nuclear group of the thalamus. The subnuclei of this nuclear group are arranged into two step-like rows, the dorsal and ventral tiers of nuclei . The dorsal tier of the thalamic nuclei is composed of the lateral dorsal nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, and the pulvinar nucleus."
"With the exception of the lateral dorsal nucleus, these nuclei are connected with the association areas of the cerebral cortex, and function in the integration of sensory input. The lateral dorsal  nucleus is the caudal continuation of the anterior thalamic nuclear group and may play a role in the expression of emotions. Like the anterior thalamic nuclear group, it receives inputs from the mammillary body via the mammillothalamic tract, and in turn projects to the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri of the limbic system."
"The lateral posterior  nucleus is the rostral continuation of the pulvinar nucleus and is believed to play a role in sensory integration. Since these nuclei have comparable connections, they are also called the pulvinar–LP complex. The LP nucleus is interconnected with the superior parietal lobule  and the precuneus."
"It also receives afferent terminals from components of the visual system: the superior colliculus, the pretectal area, and the occipital lobe. The pulvinar nucleus  is the most prominent nucleus of the thalamus and functions in the integration of visual, auditory, and somatosensory information. It has reciprocal projections with the association areas of the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes."
"It also receives sensory information from components of the visual system, the medial geniculate nucleus, and the cerebellum. The ventral tier of the thalamic nuclei includes the ventral anterior  nucleus, ventral lateral  nucleus, and ventral posterior  nucleus . The latter is further subdivided into the ventral posterior medial  nucleus, the ventral posterior lateral  nucleus, and the ventral posterior inferior  nucleus."
"The ventral tier also includes the metathalamic nuclei, including the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei  or bodies. The nuclei residing in the anterior aspect of the ventral tier of nuclei , serve as relay stations for the somatic motor system including the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. They also process inputs from the brainstem reticular formation."
"The nuclei residing in the posterior aspect of the ventral tier of nuclei  serve as relay stations for all of the sensory systems . The ventral anterior  nucleus consists of magnocellular and parvocellular components. The magnocellular component is the site of termination of the nigrothalamic pathway, which conveys information from the ipsilateral pars reticulata of the substantia nigra."
"The parvocellular component is the site of termination of the pallidothalamic pathway, which transmits information from the medial  segment of the globus pallidus. In addition, fibers from the intralaminar and midline nuclei of the thalamus, as well as from the brainstem reticular formation, terminate in the VA nucleus. This nucleus sends a spray of fibers throughout the frontal lobe."
The magnocellular component of this nucleus is interconnected with the frontal eye fields . The parvocellular component of this nucleus is interconnected with the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area . The VA nucleus plays a role in the control of movement.
"The information arising from the substantia nigra pars reticulata is involved in movements of the eyes, face, and head, whereas that arising from the medial segment of the globus pallidus is associated with movement of the limbs. The ventral lateral  nucleus is further subdivided anatomically into an anterior  portion and a posterior  portion. This nucleus, like the VA nucleus, consists of magnocellular and parvocellular components."
"The VLa receives afferent fibers from the basal ganglia. Its magnocellular component receives projections from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and its parvocellular component receives projections from the medial segment of the globus pallidus. The VLa in turn sends efferents to the supplementary motor area  of the cerebral cortex."
"The VLp receives prominent projections arising from the deep cerebellar nuclei  of the opposite side, via the dentatothalamic tract. The VLp then relays the information to the premotor and primary motor cortex . It is important to note that there is no overlap in the specific target site of termination of the afferent fibers arising from the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, and the cerebellum."
"In addition, fibers from other thalamic nuclei and the reticular formation terminate in the VL nucleus. The VL nucleus exerts its influence on somatic motor activity via the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. The ventral posterior  nucleus, also known as the ventrobasal complex, is subdivided into the VPM nucleus, VPL nucleus, and the smaller VPI nucleus, which is interposed between the latter two nuclei."
"The VP nucleus relays processed sensory information to the primary somesthetic cortex located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe . These cortical areas send corticothalamic fibers back to the VP nucleus. The VPM nucleus receives the terminals of the trigeminothalmic tracts  relaying general somatic afferent information  from the orofacial region, and special visceral afferent sensation  from the solitary nucleus."
"The VPL and VPI nuclei receive terminals of the lateral spinothalamic tract relaying pain and temperature sensation from the body, terminals of the medial lemniscus transmitting discriminatory  touch, pressure, joint movement, and vibratory sensation from the body, and terminals from the anterior spinothalamic tract relaying light  touch sensation from the body. Additionally, the VPI nucleus receives fibers from the vestibular nuclei  and projects to the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex. The metathalamic nuclei include the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei ."
"They are two oval-shaped elevations located inferior to the pulvinar of the right and left sides. The medial geniculate nucleus or body  is located on the posterior aspect of the thalamus, inferior to the pulvinar, and lateral to the superior colliculus. This nucleus receives afferent fibers relaying auditory input  from the inferior colliculus, as well as some projections from other nuclei of the auditory system via the brachium of the inferior colliculus, and directly via the lateral lemniscus ."
"The MGN gives rise to the auditory radiation that terminates in the primary auditory cortex residing in the superior transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl . Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 are reciprocally connected with the MGN. The lateral geniculate nucleus or body , a thalamic relay nucleus for vision, is larger than its medial counterpart."
"The majority of fibers of the optic tract, bringing information from both eyes, terminate here. This nucleus projects via the geniculocalcarine tract  to the primary visual cortex  on the banks of the calcarine fissure of the occipital lobe. The LGN is reciprocally connected with the primary visual cortex; additionally, it is interconnected with the pulvinar and other subnuclei of the thalamus."
"The thalamocortical projections may play a role in arousal of the organism, the control of visual attention, and the regulation of visual input transmission to the primary visual cortex. The intralaminar nuclei mark the rostral continuation of the ascending reticular activating system  into the thalamus. They consist of multiple, diffuse aggregations of nerve cell bodies embedded within the internal medullary lamina and the interthalamic adhesion of the thalamus."
"These nuclei receive sensory information from the spinothalamic tract, the ventral trigeminothalamic tract , and the multisynaptic ascending pathways of the reticular formation that relay pain sensation, pain perception, and arousal of the organism. Two of these intralaminar nuclei, the centromedian nucleus and parafascicular nucleus are readily perceptible in the posterior part of the internal medullary lamina. The centromedian nucleus is the most prominent, and is located medial to the VPM and VPL nuclei."
"The parafascicular nucleus is located medial to the centromedian nucleus. The prominent centromedian nucleus is the site of termination of the fibers arising from the globus pallidus and the premotor  and primary motor cortical areas , whereas the parafascicular nucleus is the site of termination of fibers arising from the supplementary motor area . Both of these nuclei send prominent projections to the basal ganglia ."
"Their projections to the somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex suggest that they function in sensorimotor integration. Furthermore, as a result of their widespread cortical connections they are believed to play a role in the control of cortical activity. The intralaminar nuclei are not interconnected with other thalamic nuclei; they only project to each other."
"The thalamic reticular nucleus was named for its reticular  appearance, and is not considered part of the brainstem reticular formation. It consists of a thin layer of nerve cell bodies that covers the external medullary lamina on the lateral surface of the thalamus. This is the lateral-most nucleus of the thalamus that is in direct contact with the posterior limb of the internal capsule, laterally."
"Almost all of the thalamocortical fibers destined for the cerebral cortex give rise to collaterals that end in the thalamic reticular nucleus. In addition, almost all of the corticothalamic fibers, on their way to the thalamic subnuclei, course through the thalamic reticular nucleus where they send collaterals to synapse there. The thalamostriatal and reciprocal pallidothalamic fibers also give rise to collaterals that synapse in the thalamic reticular nucleus."
"Unlike the other thalamic nuclei, which project to the cerebral cortex, the thalamic reticular nucleus has no known direct cortical connections. Instead, it relays sensory input locally within the reticular nucleus, to the other thalamic nuclei, and to the reticular formation. The thalamic reticular nucleus resides in a location where it not only receives a copy of, but can also monitor, thalamic communication with the cortex and the basal ganglia."
"This nucleus may play a role in the control of thalamic function. In addition to the anatomical classification of the thalamic nuclei that was discussed in the previous sections, these nuclei are also categorized according to their function. Functional organization of the thalamic subnuclei is based on projections between the thalamic nuclei and the cerebral cortex ."
"The thalamic nuclei have been classified into specific relay  nuclei, association  nuclei, and nonspecific nuclear functional groups. The specific relay nuclei have reciprocal feedback connections with particular, well-defined, sensory or motor areas of the cerebral cortex . All of the specific relay nuclei rest in the ventral tier of the lateral nuclear group."
"The sensory relay nuclei of the thalamus include the VPM and VPL nuclei, the MGN, and the LGN. The VPM and VPL nuclei function in the processing and integration of somatosensory information arising from the orofacial region and body, respectively. The MGN and LGN function in the processing of special sensory information related to hearing and vision, respectively."
"The motor relay nuclei of the thalamus include the VA and VL nuclei. These nuclei relay motor information arising from the somatic motor system—including the basal ganglia and the cerebellum—to the motor cortical areas. In addition to the nuclei mentioned above, the anterior nuclear group, the smallest collection of thalamic nuclei, is also included in the specific relay nuclei group."
"Via its connections to the limbic system, the anterior nuclear group plays a role in the processing of emotions, learning, and memory processes. The association  nuclei, unlike the specific relay nuclei, receive sensory and motor information from the sensory and motor systems indirectly via a relay in other thalamic nuclei, and from many different parts of the brain. The thalamic association  nuclei include the DM, LD, LP, and pulvinar nuclei."
"These nuclei are referred to as association nuclei because they have widespread connections with the cortical association areas of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. These nuclei are also referred to as multimodal nuclei because they process various modalities. They are involved in the processing of information related to memory and emotional expression, and also consolidate various types of sensory information."
"The nonspecific nuclei of the thalamus include the intralaminar nucleus and reticular thalamic nucleus. These nuclei receive terminals arising from the caudate nucleus, putamen, cerebellum, and motor cortex. They are involved in the control of arousal and consciousness."
"Some authors also include the midline nuclei in this functional group. The midline nuclei are associated with the striatum and limbic structures, and are believed to function in the modulation of cortical excitability. A tumor or stroke that results in thalamic damage and affects the VPM or VPL nuclei, may at first result in diminished or complete loss of touch, pressure, pain or temperature sensation, or proprioception from the contralateral orofacial region or body, respectively."
"Recall that the VPM nucleus of the thalamus receives projections from the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal  via the dorsal trigeminal lemniscus, and the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal  via the ventral trigeminal lemniscus from the orofacial region. The VPL nucleus receives projections from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord relaying nondiscriminatory touch, pressure, and nociceptive and temperature sensation from the contralateral side of the body via the anterolateral system. Subsequent to the loss of sensation caused by a thalamic lesion, the individual experiences paresthesias , which may progress to agonizing pain in the parts of the body where loss of sensation has occurred."
"This condition is referred to as the thalamic pain syndrome . In many cases, even nonpainful, innocuous stimuli such as a light touch or the contact of clothing on the skin, may trigger a painful sensation. This hypersensitivity is referred to as allodynia , hyperpathia , or dysesthesia ."
"The pain may originate in the thalamus but the individual perceives the pain sensation as if it arises in the part of the body where loss of sensation has occurred. A lesion damaging the ascending sensory pathways to the thalamus , or the absence of sensory input to the thalamus from a certain part of the body , may result in neural plasticity within the thalamus. Alterations in neural tissue may produce changes in neural circuitry within the thalamus, causing excruciating chronic pain."
"A sensory deficit with sudden onset and focal symptoms may be caused by ischemic stroke or hemorrhage of a cerebral vessel affecting one or more of the sensory pathways on the right side of the brain. Headache is a nonspecific symptom and may be seen in either ischemic stroke  or in cerebral hemorrhage, though it may favor the latter. Even a very small hemorrhage is easily detectible on head CT and it becomes evident immediately."
The CT in this case showed a moderately sized right thalamic hemorrhage. If this were a nonhemorrhagic stroke the CT would have been normal or may have revealed only very subtle changes. With time the stroke would have become apparent on CT .
"The main priority in the treatment of this patient is to stabilize his vital signs. The location of this hemorrhage and the high blood pressure indicate that the probable cause of the hemorrhage was hypertension. However, the patient’s blood pressure should not be abruptly lowered to “normal” levels."
Intracerebral pressure increases following an ischemic stroke or hemorrhage and it is essential that brain perfusion is maintained. This is accomplished by a modest reduction of the patient’s blood pressure. A lesion affecting the thalamus is usually easily diagnosed since it causes a pure or relatively pure contralateral sensory loss or alteration of sensation.
"Ischemic strokes and hemorrhages are the most common causes of thalamic lesions. Sometimes a thalamic lesion can cause severe, excruciating pain  that is difficult to treat. In contrast to a stroke that affects the thalamus, a stroke that produces a lesion involving a particular cortical area will produce symptoms such as aphasia  if the languagedominant hemisphere  is affected, or contralateral neglect if the nondominant hemisphere  is affected."
"These symptoms are “cortical” symptoms, and usually are indicative of a lesion  affecting a particular area of the cerebral cortex. Hypertension is one of the most common causes of intracerebral hemorrhages. It usually affects the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, or cerebellum."
"Other causes of intracranial hemorrhage include anticoagulant medication, trauma, aneurysm, or vascular malformation. Blood will resolve spontaneously with time. Depending on the size of the thalamic lesion, symptoms may resolve completely, improve partially, or remain the same over time."
A very small thalamic stroke is sometimes clinically “silent” and is only noted incidentally and after the fact on a CT or MRI done for some other reason. Most hemorrhages require a neurosurgical consultation. Large size hemorrhages sometimes need to be removed.
"A 45-year-old woman, who was previously in perfect health, had two seizures in the past week. Both occurred suddenly and each lasted less than a minute. The first seizure started as twitching of the right side of the face, which progressed to twitching of her right hand and then her right leg."
"She felt some perioral numbness as well. There was no loss of consciousness or other symptoms, and she was aware of what had occurred. This happened while in bed."
"The second seizure, as described by her husband, started with facial twitching but she rapidly lost consciousness and then had a generalized convulsion. She bit her tongue and had blood in her mouth. She also had urinary incontinence."
"She began responding a few minutes after the convulsion, but she was still confused and somewhat agitated for about 30 minutes after that. She had never had a seizure before. In between these spells she had been normal, and examination was normal."
"The cerebral cortex is the most complex component of the human brain, as a result of its complex and widespread connections. It functions in the planning and initiation of motor activity, perception and conscious awareness of sensory information, learning, cognition, comprehension, memory, conceptual thinking, and awareness of emotions. The cerebral cortex  is a multilayered sheet of nerve cell bodies and associated cell processes that covers the paired and prominent cerebral hemispheres of the cerebrum, forming an outer layer much like bark covers a tree."
"The majority of the cerebral cortex consists of phylogenetically the most highly evolved and complex neural tissue of the human brain. The central nervous system  is comprised of white and gray matter. White matter consists mostly of nerve cell axons, whereas gray matter consists mostly of nerve cell bodies."
Gray matter is arranged into nuclei or cortex. Nuclei are aggregations of nerve cell bodies embedded deep within the cerebrum or in the spinal cord. The cerebral cortex consists of 50–100 billion nerve cell bodies arranged into a three to six layered sheet that laminates the brain surface.
"The cerebral cortex overlies the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. In other animals, the brain’s cortical surface appears smooth, whereas in humans the brain surface is convoluted displaying prominent, alternating grooves and elevations as a result of the folding of the cerebral cortex, which occurs during development. The elevations are referred to as gyri, whereas the grooves are referred to as sulci or fissures ."
"Sulci are shallow, short grooves, whereas fissures are deeper and more constant grooves, with a consistent location on the brain surface. The cortex forming the gyri dips down into the pit of the adjacent sulci or fissures to line them. Certain gyri, grooves, and fissures are similar in all normal human brains."
"Others, however, may vary in different brains and in the two cerebral hemispheres of the same brain. The gyri and sulci greatly increase the total surface area of the cerebral cortex. If the cerebral cortex of a normal human brain were spread out , the cortex would extend over 0."
"23 m2 . In the course of evolution, the cerebral cortex became increasingly folded into alternating gyri and sulci or fissures to facilitate its accommodation in the limited space available in the cranial vault. The cerebral cortex covering the cerebral hemispheres is divided into the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic lobes."
"All of these lobes, with the exception of the limbic lobe, are visible on the lateral aspect of the brain. The limbic lobe is only visible on the medial surface of a midsagittally sectioned brain. In addition to the limbic lobe, the medial surface of the other lobes can also be seen on a midsagittal section of the brain."
"The cerebral cortex is classified phylogenetically into the allocortex , mesocortex , and isocortex . The allocortex  consists of the most primitive archicortex   of the hippocampal formation and the more recent paleocortex   of the parahippocampal gyrus , uncus , and lateral olfactory gyrus of the olfactory system. The mesocortex  is a transitional cortex between the allocortex and isocortex, found in the cingulate gyrus and the insula."
"The isocortex is the most recent cortex, also referred to as the neocortex , making up the four lobes, the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The neocortex makes up over 90% of the human cerebral cortex. The remainder is allocortex and mesocortex."
"The archicortex consists of three cell layers, the paleocortex from three to five cell layers, and the mesocortex from three to six cell layers, while the neocortex has six distinct cell layers. The thickness of the cortex also varies from 1. 5 mm in the primary sensory areas  to 4."
"5 mm in the motor and association cortical areas. In general, the cortex is usually thickest at the peak of each gyrus and thinnest at the pit of each sulci. The thickness reflects the different cytoarchitectonic arrangements of the various cortical areas."
"These include cell density, the types of cells present, fiber density, and the arrangement of the cells and fibers in each of the layers. The neocortex of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes is anatomically divided into the primary cortical areas and association cortical areas. The primary cortical areas are subdivided into a primary motor area and the primary sensory areas: 1 The primary motor area located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe  contains about one-third of the cell bodies of the upper motoneurons whose axons form the corticospinal tract."
"2 The primary sensory areas receive sensory information from specific thalamic nuclei, including the following four nuclei: • The ventral posterior medial  nucleus of the thalamus, which relays sensory information  from the orofacial region to the corresponding head region mapped in the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe . It also relays input about head movement and orientation to the primary vestibular area, the inferior parietal lobule. • The ventral posterior lateral  nucleus of the thalamus, which relays sensory information  from various parts of the body to the corresponding body part region mapped in the primary somatosensory cortex."
"• The lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus, which relays a single modality—visual input from the contralateral visual field to the primary visual cortex located in the banks of the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe . • The medial geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus, which relays a single modality—auditory information from both ears to the primary auditory cortex in the transverse temporal gyri of Heschl in the lateral fissure of Sylvius . Most of the cerebral cortex consists of association cortex, which is classified into unimodal association cortex and multimodal  association cortex."
"Unimodal association areas are located next to, near, or around the primary sensory cortices and expand on the functions of the respective primary areas. As an example, the primary visual cortex  projects to the visual association cortex , which processes only a single modality, in this case vision, and is thus referred to as unimodal association cortex. In contrast, the multimodal association cortical areas receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities; they integrate the information and formulate a composite experience via their higher order cognitive functions."
"The multimodal association cortex is associated with imagination, judgement, decision making, and making long-term plans. The multilayered cerebral cortex, which contains an estimated 50–100 billion neurons, is surprisingly populated by only three kinds of neurons: pyramidal cells, fusiform cells, and stellate  cells . Cells of the cerebral cortex have also been classified to include other cells; however these other cells are really variations of the pyramidal, fusiform, and stellate cells."
"Pyramidal cells may be small to giant-sized. They all have a pyramid-shaped cell body, with a dendrite emerging from its apex . This apical dendrite is oriented perpendicular to, and courses toward, the cortical surface."
"Additional dendrites, basal dendrites arising from the basal aspect of the cell body, run horizontally and parallel to the cortical surface. A single axon emerges from the base of the pyramidal cell body. Some pyramidal cells have a short axon that courses away from the cortical surface and terminates locally in other cortical layers."
"The majority of pyramidal cell axons, however, are long, give rise to a recurrent collateral branch prior to leaving the cortex, and then enter the subcortical white matter. These long axons are destined to either serve as commissural, association, or projection fibers. Commissural fibers form most of the corpus callosum and cross to the opposite cerebral hemisphere to synapse in the cerebral cortex."
"Association fibers project to cortical association areas in the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas projection fibers leave the cortex, and project to other regions of the CNS, such as the thalamus, striatum, brainstem, or spinal cord. The majority of the pyramidal cells serve in the transmission of information away from the cerebral cortex. Pyramidal cells liberate glutamate or aspartate neurotransmitters and form excitatory synapses at their termination."
"Pyramidal cells of various sizes are the most abundant cortical cells and make up about 75% of the cells of the cerebral cortex. They are also the main output neurons of the cerebral cortex. Fusiform cells reside in the deepest cortical layer, and their dendrites project toward the cortical surface ."
"These cells, like the pyramidal cells, project via association, commissural, or projection fibers. The projection fibers arising from fusiform cells project mainly to the thalamus. Stellate cells are small cells and are also referred to as granule cells."
"Since the dendrites of these cells radiate from their cell body in all planes, these cells have a star-shaped appearance . A short axon emerges from the cell body, which projects locally, in the cerebral cortex. There are two types of stellate cells based on their morphological and functional characteristics: one type are referred to as aspiny cells since they do not have spines on their dendrites."
"These neurons are believed to be inhibitory interneurons since they utilize gamma aminobutyric acid , an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The other type located mostly in layer IV of the cerebral cortex, are referred to as spiny cells since they have spines on their dendrites. They are believed to be excitatory interneurons, which release glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter."
"Spiny and aspiny cells are located in all cortical layers with the exception of the most superficial layer. The horizontal cells of Cajal, also referred to as horizontal cells, are spindleshaped cells, located only in the superficial layer of the cerebral cortex . They give rise to a dendrite and an axon, both of which remain in the superficial layer of the cortex."
"The axons of these cells run horizontally, that is, they are oriented parallel to the cortical surface and synapse with the pyramidal cell dendrites ramifying in this layer. This type of cell, though, is seldom seen or is completely lacking in adult brains. The cells of Martinotti are multipolar interneurons displaying short dendrites ."
"Although they are located throughout the cerebral cortex, they are most populous in the deepest cortical layer. Their axons, which give rise to several collateral branches, course toward the surface of the cortex. The archicortex consists of phylogenetically the most ancient cerebral cortex."
"It consists of only three cell layers: a polymorphic layer, a pyramidal layer, and a molecular layer. The archicortex is located only in the hippocampal formation. This type of cortex is associated with the limbic system, which is involved in memory processes and the expression of emotions."
"Phylogenetically, the paleocortex formed after the archicortex, and consists of three to five cell layers. It is found in the primary olfactory cortex  and the secondary olfactory cortex, which includes the entorhinal cortex of the parahippocampal gyrus. It mediates the sense of smell, and may also be involved in the processing of emotions."
"The mesocortex  is a transitional cortex between the allocortex and isocortex. It consists of three to six layers, and is found in the cingulate gyrus and the insula. The neocortex consists of six cell layers."
"In addition to being named, its cell layers are numbered sequentially with Roman numerals  in the order which they appear from superficial to deep, that is, from immediately deep to the pia mater to the subcortical white matter . Although the neocortex consists of six layers, each of these layers is not easily distinguishable in all cortical areas. In the motor cortex, layers II–V contain a vast number of large pyramidal cells whose axons leave the cortex, and in their descent to lower centers course in the corona radiata, internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, basis pontis, and pyramids of the medulla to terminate in the brainstem and spinal cord."
"Nonpyramidal  cells, on the other hand, are not as numerous in these layers of the motor cortex. Due to this morphological characteristic, the motor cortex is referred to as agranular cortex. Agranular cortex is typical of the cortical motor areas that are heavily populated by pyramidal cells."
"Unlike the motor cortex, the primary sensory cortex contains small pyramidal cells, and is heavily populated by nonpyramidal  cells. These cells give the cortex of the primary sensory areas a granular appearance, so it is referred to as granular cortex. In general, the first four layers  of the cerebral cortex serve as input stations, receiving corticopetal fibers, whereas the remaining layers  are a major source of output corticofugal projection fibers."
"The molecular  layer is the most superficial layer of the cerebral cortex, underlying the pia mater . As its name implies, the molecular layer consists mainly of interlacing nerve cell processes. Although some cells are present, they are sparse."
"The most numerous cells in this layer are the horizontal cells of Cajal, which are dispersed throughout this layer. This type of cell, though, is seldom seen or is completely lacking in adult brains. The interlacing fibers present in this layer consist of both dendrites and axons from various cells."
"The dendrites arise from the apices of pyramidal and fusiform cells whose cell bodies lie in other  cortical layers. The axons consist of afferent  axon terminals arising from the nonspecific, intralaminar, and midline nuclei of the thalamus. These thalamocortical fibers also send collaterals to layers V and VI of the cerebral cortex."
"In addition, other axons arise from stellate cells and the cells of Martinotti . Overall, this layer contains a myriad of synaptic contacts. The external granular layer  consists mainly of small granule  cells that give this layer a granular, stippled appearance."
"Other cells include small pyramidal cells. The dendritic trees emerging from these cells extend superficially to the molecular layer. Their axons course in the opposite direction to either synapse locally in other cortical layers, or to join the axons of the subcortical white matter, and project to other cortical areas as association fibers."
"The external pyramidal layer  consists predominantly of pyramidal cells. Those pyramidal cells that lie more superficially are medium sized, whereas those lying deeper within this layer, are large-sized cells. Some granule and Martinotti cells are also present."
"The apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells extend through the external granular layer to reach the molecular layer, whereas their axons join the subcortical white matter to project to other parts of the cerebral cortex mostly as association or commissural fibers. The pyramidal cell axons of this layer are the principal source of corticocortical fibers. In addition, some pyramidal cell axons referred to as projection fibers leave the cortex to terminate in other parts of the CNS."
"Some thalamocortical fibers from the specific relay thalamic nuclei terminate in this layer of the primary motor cortex. These thalamocortical fibers also send collaterals to layers V and VI. The internal granular layer  consists mostly of granule  cells, although some pyramidal cells are also present."
"The axons of the stellate cells remain in the cerebral cortex. The axons of pyramidal cells course through the deeper cortical layers to either synapse there, or join the axons of the subcortical white matter. The stellate cells receive synapses from fibers arising in the thalamic nuclei."
"The stellate cells of the primary somatosensory cortex receive thalamocortical fibers from the VPL and VPM nuclei of the thalamus; those in the primary visual cortex receive afferent fibers from the LGN; whereas those of the primary auditory cortex receive afferents from the MGN. As the myelinated thalamocortical fibers enter the internal granular layer, they become oriented horizontally to form a layer of white matter, the outer band  of Baillarger. This layer of white matter  is very prominent grossly in the primary visual cortex, and is referred to as the stripe of Gennari."
"Due to the striped appearance of the primary visual cortex, it is also referred to as the striate cortex. The thalamocortical fibers also send collaterals to layers V and VI. Layer IV is the main afferent  station of the cerebral cortex and is especially thicker in the primary sensory areas."
The internal pyramidal layer  is thickest in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex since it is a major source of efferent  fibers contributing to the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts. This layer is the source of the majority of corticofugal  fibers of the cerebral cortex. The internal pyramidal layer consists primarily of large and medium-sized pyramidal cells.
"Stellate and Martinotti cells are also present in this layer. The primary motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex contains a group of giant pyramidal cells, the cells of Betz, which are unique to layer V of this cortical area. This layer is the source of the majority of corticofugal  fibers of the cerebral cortex."
"The pyramidal cells of this layer give rise to axons that form the corticotectal, corticorubral, corticoreticular, corticopontine, corticonuclear, and corticospinal tracts. All of these tracts terminate at various levels of the brainstem, except for the corticospinal tracts that terminate in the spinal cord. In addition, corticostriate fibers arising from pyramidal cells of this layer descend to terminate in the striatum  of the basal ganglia."
"Layer V gives rise to fibers that function in motor activity. In addition to the neurons and their processes, this layer also contains a group of horizontally oriented myelinated fibers collectively forming a prominent stripe of white matter, the inner band  of Baillarger, located in the deep aspect of this layer. This stripe of white matter consists of collateral branches arising from the axons of cortical association neurons that are destined for layers II and III of the cerebral cortex, as well as collateral branches arising from the pyramidal cells residing in this layer."
"Layer V is thickest in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex since it is a major source of efferent fibers contributing to the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts. In addition to the prominent horizontally oriented outer and inner bands of Baillarger present in layers IV and V, respectively, there are also vertically oriented, but less prominent, groups of afferent and efferent axons that run through the cortical layers. The multiform  layer is the deepest layer of the cerebral cortex and lies immediately next to the white matter underlying the cortex ."
"The multiform layer consists mostly of fusiform cells, although pyramidal cells and interneurons are also present. The axons of the fusiform and pyramidal cells course in the underlying white matter as association and commissural fibers that terminate in the cerebral cortex, or as corticothalamic projection fibers that terminate in the thalamus. The cerebral cortex is not only organized into six cell layers that run parallel to the cortical surface, but it is also organized into cell columns, which are aligned perpendicular to the cortical surface."
"The cortical columns are believed to hold the key to cortical function, and represent specific functional units. As an example, within the somesthetic cortex, the cells of certain specific columns are stimulated by impulses related to touch, other columns respond to nociception, whereas others respond to proprioceptive input. The cerebral cortex receives the following afferent  fibers: corticocortical  excitatory fibers  from ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas, thalamocortical excitatory fibers from thalamic nuclei, cholinergic excitatory fibers from the basal forebrain nuclei, noradrenergic inhibitory fibers from the brainstem locus ceruleus, and serotonergic inhibitory fibers from the brainstem raphe nuclei."
"The afferent fibers arising from the VPL, VPM, ventral lateral , and ventral anterior  nuclei and the MGN and LGN of the thalamus establish synaptic contacts with the stellate cells residing in layer IV of the cerebral cortex. Fibers arising from other thalamic nuclei and the remaining cortical input sources establish synaptic contacts in layers I–IV of the cerebral cortex. The cholinergic and serotonergic afferents to the cerebral cortex function in the control of sleep and arousal."
"Cortical efferent fibers arise from the output neurons of the cerebral cortex: the pyramidal and fusiform cells. Their myelinated axons course deep, pass into the subcortical white matter, and then are distributed to widespread regions of the CNS. Thus the subcortical white matter consists of these three main types of fibers: association, commissural, and projection fibers."
"Association fibers consist of axons arising from small pyramidal cells, primarily from cortical layers II and III. These fibers vary in length from short to long, and project in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Association fibers that connect various cortical areas make up most of the subcortical white matter."
"These fibers gather to form fasciculi that connect different lobes, but, like a two-way highway, fibers merge into and exit these fasciculi all along their course. The short association fibers connect adjacent gyri. These fibers leave the cortex of one gyrus, enter the underlying white matter, and then loop around the pit of a sulcus and project into the cortex of an adjacent gyrus."
Consequently these fibers are also referred to as U-fibers or arcuate fibers . These fibers bridge the primary sensory areas with the adjacent cortical association areas. The long association fibers connect different lobes of the same hemisphere.
"These fibers leave the cortex of one lobe, enter the underlying white matter, gather to form a bundle, and then project to the cortex of a different lobe of the same hemisphere. Bundles of long association fibers form the following fasciculi: the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, the superior and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi, and the cingulum . The superior longitudinal fasciculus interconnects the frontal lobe with the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes."
"As these fibers link these lobes they form a dome over the insula and radiate within the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The superior longitudinal fasciculus contains a group of fibers, the arcuate fasciculus, that forms a distinct arch posterior to the insula. This fasciculus links Broca’s area  with Wernicke’s area ."
"The inferior longitudinal fasciculus  connects the temoporal and occcipital lobes. The superior occipitofrontal fasciculus  interconnects the frontal lobe with the occipital lobe. The fibers of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, which like their superior counterpart also interconnect the frontal and occipital lobes, radiate in the frontal lobe, pass through the temporal lobe inferior to the insula, to also radiate in the occipital lobe."
"Some of its fibers curve around on the deep aspect of the lateral sulcus, interconnecting the frontal and temporal lobes, and as a result of their hook-like path are referred to as the uncinate fasciculus . The cingulum is embedded in the cingulate gyrus, and its fibers form a connection between the anterior perforated substance and the parahippocampal gyrus. Commissural fibers arise in one cerebral hemisphere, and cross the midline to terminate in the corresponding cortical area of the contralateral hemisphere ."
"These fibers provide an avenue of communication between the corresponding cortical areas of the two hemispheres. Commissural fibers consist of the myelinated axons of medium-sized pyramidal neurons residing in various layers of the cerebral cortex. The corpus callosum is the most massive commissure in the entire nervous system, linking mainly corresponding areas of the neocortex of the two cerebral hemispheres."
"The corpus callosum, however, also contains commissural fibers that arise in certain cortical areas of one cerebral hemisphere and cross to the opposite side to terminate in noncorresponding areas of the contralateral hemisphere. This is true for fibers arising in the primary visual cortex of one cerebral hemisphere that cross to the opposite side to terminate in the visual association cortex of the contralateral hemisphere. Similarly, parts of the motor and somesthetic cortical areas where the hand is represented, do not receive commissural fibers from the corresponding motor and sensory cortical areas of the contralateral hemisphere."
"However, the somesthetic association areas receive commissural fibers that connect the two cerebral hemispheres, thus each hemisphere samples information available to the contralateral hemisphere. The corpus callosum consists of the following component parts: the rostrum and genu anteriorly, the body forming the roof of the lateral ventricles, and the splenium posteriorly. The rostrum and genu consist of commissural fibers connecting the anterior cortical areas of the frontal lobe."
"The body consists of most of the commissural fibers that connect the remaining frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and part of the temporal lobe. Posteriorly, the splenium consists of commissural fibers that connect the occipital lobes. Cortical commissural fibers emerge mainly from the pyramidal cells residing in the cortical superficial layers and the external granular  and external pyramidal  layers."
"Other commissures of the brain include the anterior  and posterior commissures that bridge the temporal lobes, and the hippocampal commissure  connecting the hippocampal formation of the two hemispheres. Commissural fibers form an anatomical bridge connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, which is essential in the integration of information in the two sides of the brain. The afferent fibers to the cerebral cortex are also referred to as corticopetal fibers."
"They include:  thalamocortical fibers arising from the VPL and VPM nuclei of the thalamus relaying sensory information such as touch, pressure, conscious proprioception, two-point tactile sensation, as well as pain and temperature sensation from the body and head to the sensory cortex;  the MGN of the thalamus relaying auditory information via the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex; and  the LGN of the thalamus relaying visual information via the optic radiation to the visual cortex. Although these afferent fibers terminate in layers I–IV of the cerebral cortex, most terminate in layer IV. The efferent fibers from the cerebral cortex are referred to as corticofugal fibers."
"These fibers consist of axons arising from large pyramidal cells that course in the corona radiata and internal capsule to terminate in the basal ganglia, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. Corticofugal fibers include fibers of the corticoreticular, corticorubral, corticonuclear, corticopontine, corticotegmental, and corticospinal tracts. The internal capsule is a massive, fan-shaped collection of fibers  that connect the thalamus to the cerebral cortex."
"On horizontal section, it appears as a wide letter “L” with its apex directed toward the midline of the cerebrum. It is divided into an anterior limb, a genu , and a posterior limb. The two limbs converge toward the genu, the angle between the anterior and posterior limbs."
The anterior limb is interposed between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus. The posterior limb is interposed between the thalamus and the globus pallidus. The majority of the internal capsule fibers traversing the cerebrum connect the thalamus to the cerebral cortex.
"Descending motor fibers arising from the motor cortex destined for the brainstem and the spinal cord also descend in the internal capsule. In addition to the above components, the internal capsule also has a sublenticular limb whose fibers run ventral to the lenticular nucleus and a retrolenticular limb whose fibers run caudal to the lenticular nucleus. The anterior limb of the internal capsule includes the anterior thalamic radiations  serving as a channel between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex."
Frontopontine fibers also pass through the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The genu of the internal capsule transmits corticonuclear  fibers arising from the frontal and motor cortex and descend to terminate in the cranial nerve motor nuclei in the brainstem. The posterior limb accommodates the corticospinal tract in its posterior third or half and the central thalamic radiations .
"The sublenticular limb carries the auditory radiations arising from the MGN to terminate in the transverse temporal gyri of Heschl. The retrolenticular limb carries visual information from the LGN to the visual cortex via the geniculocalcarine radiations . As the fibers of the internal capsule emerge from between the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus, they spread out forming a curved radiating crown, the corona radiata, containing afferent and efferent fibers to and from the cerebral cortex."
"The cerebral cortex of each cerebral hemisphere is divided anatomically into five lobes: the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic lobes . All of the lobes are visible on the lateral aspect of the brain, with the exception of the limbic lobe, which is visible only from the medial surface of the brain. The frontal lobe is involved in motor control, cognitive functions, the processing of emotions, and the motor aspects of language."
"The parietal lobe functions in sensation; it processes touch, pressure, pain and temperature sensation, and proprioception. The temporal lobe contains the cortical areas that process hearing, memory, emotions, and the sensory aspects of speech. The occipital lobe has the exclusive function of processing visual information, and the limbic lobe functions in the processing of emotions."
"The frontal lobe extends from the rostral pole of the cerebral hemisphere, caudally to the central sulcus  and inferiorly to the lateral fissure  . The parietal lobe extends from the central sulcus anteriorly, to the parieto-occipital sulcus posteriorly, and the lateral fissure inferiorly. The temporal lobe extends from the lateral fissure superiorly, to its free inferior border, and posteriorly to an imaginary line extending from the posterior extent of the lateral fissure inferior–posteriorly, separating it from the occipital lobe."
"The occipital lobe extends from the parieto-occipital sulcus to the preoccipital notch, which accommodates the lateral pole of the cerebellar hemisphere. It consists of the cortex covering the caudal pole of the cerebral hemisphere. The limbic lobe is not visible laterally."
"Unlike the other lobes, which consist of only neocortex, it is composed of archicortex, mesocortex, and some neocortex. The cerebral cortex consists of certain cell types arranged into three to six layers, as described above. The thickness of these layers, and the number and type of cells within each layer, however, varies in different regions of the cortex."
"The cerebral cortex was originally classified by Brodmann into 52 different cytoarchitectural areas, but he did not assign a function to each area at that time. He numbered them 1 to 52, which reflected the order in which he examined and mapped them . Additional studies have provided information correlating a function to many of these areas, referred to as Brodmann’s areas."
"The anatomical/functional correlation, however, is not as accurate as was thought in the past. Some of these areas are so commonly referred to that both name, and number, should be known by the student. These areas are: the primary somatosensory cortex , motor cortex , secondary sensory cortex , visual cortex , and auditory cortex ."
"The functional areas of the cerebral cortex are shown in . he motor activity of the entire opposite side of the body is controlled by the motor areas of the cerebral cortex that are located anterior to the central sulcus. Fibers arise from the primary motor cortex , the secondary motor cortex , and the primary somatosensory  cortex  of the frontal and parietal lobes to terminate in the motor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord."
"The primary motor cortex resides in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe, and corresponds to Brodmann’s area 4. It plays an important role in the execution of distinct, well defined, voluntary movement . The precentral gyrus of the right cerebral hemisphere controls movement of the left side of the head and body, whereas that of the left cerebral hemisphere controls the right side of the head and body."
"The body is mapped on the primary motor cortex somatotopically as an upside down homonculus  . The part of the precentral gyrus controlling movement of the toes is located near its superior aspect, whereas the part of the precentral gyrus controlling movement of the tongue, mouth, and larynx is located near its inferior aspect . A noticeable characteristic of the primary motor cortex in humans is that more than half of it is associated with the motor activity of the hands, tongue, lips, and larynx—reflecting the manual dexterity and ability for speech that humans possess."
"It also contributes to the motor control of the limb musculature, specifically to the control of the distal muscles of the extremities . Nerve cells in the primary motor cortex are organized into groups, each group sending its axons to the cranial nerve motor nuclei, or the reticular formation, or the spinal cord gray matter, where they control the motor activity of a single muscle. The total cortical area that mediates motor activity of a particular body region is proportional to the complexity of the movements produced in that region."
"Prior to the onset of movement, the primary motor cortex receives instructions and information about the pattern of the intended movement from the other motor areas of the cortex. The secondary motor cortex consists of four regions: the supplementary motor area, the premotor cortex, the frontal eye field, and the posterior parietal motor area. The first three of these motor cortical areas reside in the frontal lobe ; the posterior parietal motor area is located in the parietal lobe."
"The principal function of the secondary motor cortex is the programing of complex motor activity, which is then relayed to the primary motor cortex where the execution of motor activity is initiated. The primary motor cortex then translates this information into the execution of movement, and relays it mainly to the brainstem or spinal cord. Most of the nerve signals that arise in the secondary motor cortex mediate complex movements produced by groups of muscles performing a particular task, unlike the discrete muscle contractions elicited by stimulation of the primary motor cortex."
"The supplementary motor area  corresponds to the medial and superolateral aspect of Brodmann’s area 6. This area receives axon terminals from the basal ganglia  via a relay in the ventral lateral  nucleus of the thalamus. Input from the basal ganglia assists the SMA in its role in the programing phase of the patterns and sequences of complex movements, and the coordination of bilateral movements."
"The SMA mediates muscle contractions of the axial  and proximal limb  musculature . The premotor cortex  corresponds to most of Brodmann’s area 6 on the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe. The PMC receives axon terminals from the cerebellum via a relay in the ventral lateral  nucleus of the thalamus, and fibers from the cortical association areas."
Input from the cerebellum assists the PMC in its role in movement. The main function of this area is the motor control of axial and proximal limb musculature. It also plays a role in orienting the body and upper limbs in the direction of a target.
"Once a motor task has been initiated, activity in the PMC diminishes, reflecting its key function in the planning phase of motor activity. The frontal eye field  corresponds to Brodmann’s area 8. This cortical area is located rostral to the premotor area, on the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe."
"This area contains nerve cell bodies whose axons join the corticonuclear tract and descend to terminate in the eye movement control centers located in the midbrain reticular formation and the paramedian pontine reticular formation. They in turn transmit information to the motor nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, which control voluntary eye movements. The FEF plays a role in the coordination of eye movements, particularly those mediating voluntary visual tracking of a moving object via conjugate deviation of the eyes."
"The posterior parietal motor area  corresponds to Brodmann’s areas 5 and 7. Area 5 is associated with tactile discrimination and stereognosis, as well as statognosis in relation to reaching and guiding movements . Area 7  is involved with movements that require visual guidance."
"The primary sensory areas are involved in distinguishing and integrating sensory input relayed there primarily by the thalamic nuclei. The primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe, and corresponds to Brodmann’s areas 3, 1, and 2 . The primary somatosensory cortex also comprises the dorsal part of the paracentral lobule, which resides and is visible only on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere."
"This cortical region is the site of termination of the thalamocortical fibers arising from the VPL and VPM nuclei of the thalamus. These fibers relay sensory information from the contralateral half of the body and head, respectively. The body is represented on the somatosensory cortex by an upside-down homunculus ."
"The foot is represented on the superior medial surface of the hemisphere, the leg, thigh, trunk, shoulder, arm, and forearm on the superior surface of the postcentral gyrus, whereas the hand, head, teeth, tongue, larynx, and pharynx are on the lateral surface of the postcentral gyrus. The total cortical area representing a body part is proportional to the discriminative capability of the body part. The primary sensory cortex also includes Brodmann’s area 3a, which is buried in the central sulcus."
"This area receives sensory input from muscle receptors. Some of the cells residing in the primary somatosensory cortex give rise to fibers that descend to terminate in the brainstem and spinal cord gray matter. There they influence motor activity, not by synapsing with motoneurons, but instead by modulating the transmission of sensory input from peripheral structures into the brainstem and spinal cord."
"The neurons residing in the visual cortex respond to different visual stimuli relayed by neurons conveying color, motion, three-dimensional vision, or a combination of various visual stimuli. The primary visual cortex is located mainly in the medial surface of the occipital lobes on the banks of the calcarine fissure, although it extends into their posterolateral surface. The primary visual cortex is the thinnest cortex of the entire brain."
"Layer IV of this cortex is prominent due to a thick layer of myelinated fibers, the external band of Baillarger. This band is characteristically so thick in this cortex that it gives the primary visual cortex a grossly visible striped appearance, and is referred to as the stripe of Gennari. The primary visual cortex thus is also referred to as the striate cortex."
The LGN projects visual information to the primary visual cortex  . This cortical area receives visual input arising from the contralateral visual field: the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina and the nasal half of the contralateral retina. The primary visual cortex receives fibers of the geniculocalcarine tract  arising from the LGN of the thalamus.
"Table 23. 1 lists the topographic relationships of fibers from the retina to the LGN, and then to the banks of the calcarine sulcus. The primary visual cortex receives visual input from the macula of the retina in its caudal third, and from the paramacular  fields of the retina in its rostral portions."
"The macular representation in the primary visual cortex is much larger than that of other areas of the retina, reflecting the high visual acuity of the macula. The primary visual cortex is arranged into columns oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface, extending from the cortical surface  to the subcortical white matter. Nerve cells in a particular cortical column are functionally similar."
"Columns in the primary visual cortex include the ocular dominance columns, the site where fibers relaying information from the ipsilateral or the contralateral eye terminate, and the orientation columns, where nerve cells are responsive to visual stimuli that have a comparable spatial orientation. Layers II and III of the primary visual cortex also contain vertically oriented aggregates of nerve cells that are responsive to color. The primary auditory cortex  resides deep in the lateral fissure , in the hidden superior surface of the superior temporal gyrus, containing the transverse temporal gyri of Heschl, and in the floor of the lateral fissure."
"The primary auditory cortex of each side receives information from both ears by way of the medial geniculate body of the thalamus, and then sends projections to the contralateral side via the corpus callosum. The primary auditory cortex plays an important function in the detection of pattern alteration as well as in the location of the sound. The primary auditory cortex receives the auditory radiations from the lateral geniculate nucleus."
"This cortical region has a tonotopic representation of frequencies, that is, neurons responding to low frequencies reside in its rostral extent, whereas neurons responding to high frequencies reside in its caudal extent. The primary auditory cortex is arranged into two-dimensional, alternating, vertically oriented columns of neurons. One dimension of the auditory cortex is composed of frequency columns."
"The cells in each frequency column respond to an auditory stimulus of a particular frequency. As mentioned above, cells responding to low frequencies reside in the frequency columns located in the rostral extent of the transverse temporal gyri of Heschl, whereas frequency columns containing cells responding to gradually higher frequencies are lined up in sequence toward the caudal extent of the primary auditory cortex. The other dimension of the auditory cortex is composed of alternating binaural columns."
"There are two types of binaural columns: summation columns and suppression columns. The neurons residing in the summation columns respond to an auditory stimulus that stimulates both ears simultaneously. In contrast, the neurons in the suppression columns respond maximally to an auditory stimulus that stimulates only one ear, but respond minimally when the auditory stimulus stimulates both ears ."
"The cortical area that receives vestibular information is ambiguous. However, it is believed that the vestibular nuclei project primarily crossed fibers to the contralateral VPM nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn relays this input to the inferior parietal lobule, the primary vestibular area, and the superior temporal gyrus next to the primary auditory cortex. This area receives input related to head movement and position."
Taste receptors relay gustatory information to the solitary nucleus in the brainstem. The solitary nucleus then transmits the information via the ipsilateral central tegmental tract to the VPM nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamus then projects this input to the inferior extent of the postcentral gyrus .
"The cortical area where taste information is relayed resides next to the area where the general sensory input from the tongue is transmitted. The primary olfactory area is located in the prepiriform and periamygdaloid regions of the cerebral cortex. These regions, however, unlike other cortical areas, have not been assigned a Brodmann’s area number Sensory association areas are also referred to as secondary sensory areas, and usually surround the primary sensory areas."
"They receive input from the primary sensory areas and further process, integrate, and interpret the incoming sensory input. The cerebral cortex of the human brain is classified into sensory, motor and association cortex. The human brain contains more association cortex than the brain of any other animal, and thus is the principal component of the human cerebral cortex."
"The sophisticated functions of the human association cortex is what distinguishes us from other animals. Our ability to learn, reason, and plan our daily activities and lives, and our language skills, are some examples of association cortical functions. A somesthetic association area is located in the cortex of the superior parietal lobule ."
"This cortex receives input mainly from the primary somesthetic cortex; however fibers arising from the VPL and VPM nuclei of the thalamus also terminate here. This cortex functions primarily in the integration of sensory input from various sensory systems. One way of testing the function of the somesthetic association cortex of a patient is by placing an object  in his hand, and while his eyes are closed ask him to identify the object by using his other senses ."
"In order to identify the object, an individual needs to feel the size, shape, texture, and weight of the object, but in addition, to recognize it by associating it with previous sensory experiences linked to it. This should enable the individual to recognize and identify the object without looking. The primary visual cortex projects to the surrounding visual association cortex , which consists of the secondary and tertiary visual cortical areas."
"The primary visual cortex projects to the visual association areas where information is processed and subsequently relayed to the tertiary visual areas  of the cortex. The secondary visual areas function in identifying an object, determining its location and color, comparing it to prior visual experiences, and determining its significance. Furthermore, the middle temporal area has an important function in detecting moving objects."
"The secondary auditory cortical areas, although numerous, are not well defined, and include Brodmann’s area 22 and part of area 42. They surround the primary auditory cortex and form reciprocal connections with the primary auditory cortex. The secondary auditory cortical areas function in the interpretation of sounds and, via their connections with Wernicke’s area, function in the comprehension of language."
"There are two cortical areas that function in the processing of language: Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area. The left cerebral hemisphere is the dominant hemisphere in language functions in the majority of individuals. Wernicke’s area  consists of auditory association cortex , as well as parts of the supramarginal and angular gyri ."
"Wernicke’s area is also referred to as the receptive  language area, general interpretative area, or the gnostic area. It plays an important role in the comprehension and formulation of language. In the right cerebral hemisphere this cortical area is an auditory association area that serves to determine the emotional undertones of language."
"When we hear someone speak, the person’s voice often reveals if he/she is happy, upset, angry, etc. Broca’s area , the motor speech area , is located in the opercular and triangular portions of the inferior frontal gyrus. This area not only functions in the initiation of a sequence of complex movements , which are essential in the production of speech , but also has expressive language capacities ."
"The supplementary motor area is also necessary in the production of language. Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas of speech are interconnected via the arcuate fasciculus , which is necessary for language and the ability to communicate. The following is a general description of how a word that is heard is repeated ."
"Auditory sensory input  reaching the ear is relayed via the auditory pathway to the primary auditory cortex where it is “heard. ” The primary auditory cortex transmits the input to the auditory association cortex, which functions in the interpretation of sound. This sound is comprehended in Wernicke’s area, which projects the information by way of cortical association fibers  to Broca’s area."
"Broca’s area is involved in the planning of the motor activity that is necessary for the word to be produced. Broca’s area projects this information to the premotor cortex where motor activity is planned and relayed to the primary motor cortex, which initiates the movements necessary to produce speech. When an individual reads and says the words , the visual pathway relays the sensory visual input to the primary visual cortex where the words are “seen."
"” The primary visual cortex transmits this input to the association visual cortex where the significance of the words is determined. The visual information is then relayed to Wernicke’s area where the words are comprehended, and the creation of the words takes place. Wernicke’s area then projects to Broca’s area, which, as described above, dictates the motor activity necessary to produce the words."
"The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe, anterior to the motor cortex, and consists of multimodal association cortex. It has extensive reciprocal connections with the dorsomedial, ventral anterior, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei via corticothalamic and thalamocortical projection fibers. In addition, its orbital region is associated with the limbic system, whereas its dorsolateral region is interconnected with the association areas of the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes via long association bundles."
"Furthermore, both of these cortical regions are a source of fibers that terminate in the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal ganglia. Commissural fibers arising from the prefrontal cortex pass via the corpus callosum to the opposite hemisphere to terminate not only in the cortex of the prefrontal area, but also in that of the other lobes. The dorsolateral region of the prefrontal cortex functions in working memory."
"Observing a laboratory demonstration at school and then being able to repeat the task soon afterwards, is an example of working memory. Individuals with lesions o the dorsolateral region have difficulty in problem solving and in paying attention. The main function of the orbital region is the expression of an appropriate behavioral response in a particular situation."
"Individuals with lesions in the orbital region are impulsive and exhibit an inappropriate behavioral response for a given circumstance. The prefrontal cortex may play a role in the individual’s level of intelligence, education, as well as psychological state. It is believed that the prefrontal cortex may correspond to the neocortical area of the limbic system."
"In the human brain, the left cerebral hemisphere is usually the dominant hemisphere , whereas the right hemisphere is the nondominant hemisphere . The dominant hemisphere mediates processes related to language, speech, problem solving, and mathematical skills. The nondominant hemisphere mediates spatial perception, recognition of faces, as well as music and poetry skills."
"Over the years, clinical information has been derived from studying patients treated for various cortical lesions resulting from trauma, cerebral vascular accident , or tumors. In addition, cortical function has also been studied by observations made on conscious patients  while undergoing brain surgery. Interestingly, although the brain processes pain sensation arising from other injured body tissues, the brain itself has no pain sensation; thus recordings and observations can be made during brain surgery while the patient is awake."
"The cerebral cortex is an extraordinary structure since, following a cerebral lesion, some cortical functional reorganization can result to some degree in restored cortical function. Historically, surgical sectioning of the corpus callosum has been performed to alleviate symptoms of epilepsy. This surgical procedure has proved to be effective in preventing seizures from being transferred from one cerebral hemisphere to the other."
"Although individuals seem normal following this surgery, postoperative studies have revealed some interesting findings. When patients were asked to read words that were presented in their right visual field, they were able to see and to read the words. However, when words were presented in their left visual field, they could not read them as they were not even aware that the words were there."
"One explanation is as follows: visual information from the right visual field is relayed to the left cerebral hemisphere , which is the dominant hemisphere in the processing of language in most individuals. Thus the patients were able to see and read the words. In contrast, visual input from the left visual field is relayed to the right cerebral hemisphere , the nondominant hemisphere for language."
"As a result of the bisection of the corpus callosum the visual input relayed to the right cerebral hemisphere has no way of also reaching the left hemisphere containing the language areas. Consequently, patients could not see or read the words, as if they had a left homonymous hemianopia. These individuals are not blind."
"When they were asked to select with their hand an object that corresponds to the object that was presented in their left visual field, they selected the matching object. This showed that the visual system is functioning properly, and that it is the language function that is not. Although the above studies support the finding that the left cerebral hemisphere is the “dominant” hemisphere in the processing of language, other studies indicate that the right hemisphere may also be involved to some extent in language comprehension."
The corpus callosum receives its blood supply from the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. Its genu and body are supplied by the anterior cerebral artery and the splenium is supplied by both the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. A stroke involving the anterior cerebral artery may affect the anterior corpus callosum and result in apraxia  of the left arm as a consequence of the isolation/disconnection of the language-dominant  hemisphere from the right motor cortex.
"A stroke involving the posterior cerebral artery or a lesion involving the posterior corpus callosum on the left side, may result in alexia . Visual input from the left visual field is relayed to the right, intact visual cortex, which is isolated/disconnected from the language-dominant  hemisphere. If the basilar artery is affected, which gives rise to both the posterior cerebral arteries, infarction of the visual cortex will be bilateral and will cause cortical blindness; however, the affected individual is unaware that he cannot see."
"A unilateral lesion in the primary motor cortex   results in paralysis of the upper and lower limbs contralateral to the lesion. Initially, a contralateral flaccid paralysis occurs. About 2 weeks following the lesion, the individual will regain function of the proximal limb musculature."
"Lesions confined to the primary motor cortex are rare. If the lesion also involves area 6, the paralysis will persist and spasticity  will appear in the distal limb muscles. With this type of lesion, fine movements of the distal limbs  will be affected most."
"The corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts arising from the primary motor cortex synapse with interneurons and lower motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, respectively, which normally cause an increase in  muscle tone. The fibers arising from the secondary motor cortex that relay motor input to the basal ganglia and reticular formation exert an inhibitory influence diminishing muscle tone. A lesion in the secondary motor cortex will eliminate this inhibitory effect, and will ultimately result in muscle spasticity."
"A unilateral lesion in the secondary motor cortex   results in the inability to coordinate hand movements bilaterally. The individual will have no difficulty in coordinating the same movement with both hands concurrently. However, when attempting to perform different movements with each hand concurrently, it will be difficult or impossible to execute."
"A unilateral lesion of both the primary and secondary motor cortical areas will produce a more severe form of contralateral paralysis. Following trauma to the head involving the brain, scar tissue formation in the brain often results in epileptic seizures. A lesion of the primary motor cortex, with subsequent scar tissue formation, results in Jacksonian epileptic seizures."
"In this type of seizure convulsions may occur only in a certain part of the body, or additional parts of the body may be involved as well, depending on the site of the primary motor cortex that is affected by the lesion. Normally, stimulation of the frontal eye field results in deviation of both eyes toward the contralateral side. A unilateral lesion in the frontal eye field  results in both eyes deviating to the side ipsilateral to the lesion."
"In addition, the affected individual will be unable to turn the eyes contralateral to the lesion. The effects of frontal eye field lesions are not permanent. A unilateral lesion in Broca’s area   of speech in the dominant cerebral hemisphere results in Broca’s  aphasia ."
"An individual with this condition has difficulty expressing a thought, is nonfluent, and speaks slowly and with difficulty, although he does not have a lower motoneuron lesion innervating the muscles used in phonation, and these muscles are normal. In addition, his use of words is distorted. He only uses the main or necessary words of a sentence ."
"An individual who has a severe form of Broca’s aphasia is incapable of speaking. This is known as mutism. Although spoken and written language comprehension in Broca’s aphasia is a relatively preserved skill, it is still affected by the lesion."
"Interestingly, the individual is aware that what he is saying makes no sense. As mentioned earlier, Broca’s area is involved in the planning of motor activity that is necessary for words to be produced. Broca’s area projects this information to the premotor cortex where motor activity is planned and relayed to the primary motor cortex, which initiates the movements necessary to produce speech."
A lesion in Broca’s area will disrupt the Broca’s area input to the premotor cortex. Broca’s aphasia also impairs an individual’s ability to express a thought or concept by writing it down. This is known as agraphia .
"A unilateral lesion in Wernicke’s area in the dominant hemisphere , involving Brodmann’s areas 22, 37, 39, and 40 , results in Wernicke’s  aphasia. Since this area plays a role in the comprehension and formulation of language, an individual with a severe form of this condition has difficulty comprehending the spoken word and is unable to read  or write in understandable language , even though the visual and auditory systems are normal. Even if speech is fluent, and the patient can speak with ease, the combination and order of the words selected is meaningless and makes no sense to him or others."
"This is referred to as fluent paraphasic speech . Interestingly, this individual is unaware of his deficiencies. In milder forms of Wernicke’s aphasia, an individual may use the wrong word  or use a word that sounds like the word he intended to say in a sentence ."
"A lesion affecting both Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas in the dominant hemisphere, results in a severe condition referred to as global aphasia. An affected individual is unable to comprehend what he hears or reads, cannot write, and in addition is unable to formulate normal language. A lesion in the arcuate fasciculus component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus will interrupt the connection between Brocas’s and Wernicke’s are as , the two language areas, and will result in conduction aphasia."
"An individual with this type of lesion is able to comprehend what he hears  and his language expression is fluent; however, he has difficulty processing what he hears and then formulating a proper response. Lesions involving other afferent fibers from various cortical areas terminating in Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas also produce aphasic syndromes, referred to as transcortical aphasias. The lesions are extrinsic and do not involve Broca’s or Wernicke’s language areas."
"However, affected individuals present symptoms characteristic of Broca’s or Wernicke’s aphasia as a consequence of the lack of input to the language areas, which is essential for normal linguistic function and capacity. A unilateral lesion in the primary somesthetic area   results in contralateral loss of two-point discrimination, graphesthesia , and stereognosis , as well as the loss of vibratory and position sense. In addition, the significance of the qualitative and quantitative perception of the stimulus is diminished or absent."
"Usually, pain, temperature, and light touch sensation are only minimally impaired; however, the individual is unable to localize the stimulus. A lesion in the secondary somesthetic area results in minimal sensory loss . However, since the secondary somesthetic area plays an important role in the memory of somatosensory information and sensory integration, the individual has a condition referred to as agnosia ."
Agnosias are classified according to the particular secondary  cortex affected. If there is a lesion in the secondary somesthetic cortex the deficits resulting from the lesion are referred to as astereognosis and tactile agnosia. An individual with this type of lesion  is unable to identify a familiar object such as a spoon placed in his palm while his eyes are closed.
"Although he can feel the object in his palm, and information about it  is transmitted to the primary sensory cortex, he is unable to identify it as the sensory association cortex  is not functioning. Thus, this new information cannot be assembled and compared to stored information and matched, which is necessary for the identification of the object. Astereognosis does not only affect an individual’s ability to recognize objects without looking at them, but also results in him experiencing a loss of awareness of the position of parts of his body contralateral to the lesion."
"A condition, referred to as cortical neglect, is a severe form of astereognosis, in which the affected individual ignores or denies the presence of one side of his body. This condition most frequently results from an extensive lesion in the superior aspect of the nondominant parietal lobule . Since the individual does not recognize certain parts of his body as being his, he will not wash his left hand, or shave the left side of his face, etc."
"A unilateral lesion in the primary visual area   results in blindness of the contralateral visual field, referred to as a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia. If destruction of the primary visual cortex is the result of a vascular lesion, macular sparing may occur, that is, central vision is unaffected. It is believed that this is due to the presence of collateral anastomotic channels between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries."
"A bilateral lesion in the primary visual area results in complete blindness, also referred to as cortical blindness. A lesion in the association visual areas    results in visual agnosia. Since the visual pathways and primary visual cortex are intact, the individual is able to “see” an object or person."
"However, although he may be looking at a familiar object  or person, he is unable to identify them, or describe the function of the toaster. An individual with visual agnosia may recognize an object one day but not the next. Also, he may recognize certain familiar objects but not others."
"Interestingly, an object may be identified by other senses, such as touch. Dyslexia is a type of visual agnosia. Individuals with this disorder are unable to read and write words, although they can see and recognize letters."
"A unilateral lesion in the primary auditory area results in partial deafness. This is due to a bilateral deficit in hearing since auditory information arising in each ear is relayed to the cortical primary auditory area bilaterally. Usually, individuals with this type of lesion experience a greater loss of hearing in the ear contralateral to the cortical lesion."
"Recall that a greater number of fibers relaying auditory input to the cortex decussate, whereas a lesser number of fibers project ipsilaterally. An individual with this lesion has difficulty in localizing sounds on the opposite side. A bilateral lesion of the primary auditory area results in total deafness."
"A unilateral lesion in the auditory association area of the dominant  hemisphere results in receptive aphasia. A unilateral lesion in the nondominant  hemisphere results in amusia, a condition in which the individual is unable to recognize familiar voices or music. A bilateral lesion of the auditory association area results in auditory agnosia in which the individual does not recognize complex sounds."
"A unilateral lesion in the superior temporal gyrus  results in subjective vertigo, in which the individual has the strange experience of feeling as though he is spinning around his environment. In contrast, a unilateral lesion in the parietal lobe in the lower margin of the intraparietal sulcus results in objective vertigo, in which the individual feels as though the environment is revolving around him. An individual with a lesion in the prefrontal association cortex displays changes in various personality traits as well as changes in higher order functions and/or executive functions such as judgement, creativity, analytic thinking, responsibility, etc."
"These are more pronounced if the lesion is bilateral. In addition, the individual behaves in a manner that is socially inappropriate. His behavior is characterized by a lack of self-respect or concern for others, he loses the social skills necessary to interact with others, is easily distracted, and is emotionally unstable."
"Dorsolateral convexity lesions result in apathetic, lifeless behavior; orbitofrontal lesions result in disinhibited behavior and poor judgement; left frontal lesions result in depressed behavior; and right frontal lesions result in manic behavior. A unilateral lesion in the parietal lobe of the dominant hemisphere results in various conditions collectively known as apraxias . Apraxia is a condition in which an individual’s ability to perform certain skilled movements that are normally triggered by a stimulus is impaired, although the individual does not have any sensory or motor deficits."
"A unilateral lesion in the supramarginal gyrus   of the parietal lobe results in an ideomotor apraxia, in which the individual’s ability to perform a desired activity is impaired. For example, although the individual can perform certain motor activities, his impairment prevents him from doing them on command. Ideational apraxia is a condition in which the individual is able to perform certain activities separately, for example picking up a glass, filling it with water, and drinking it; however, when asked to perform these activities in that sequence, he is unable to do them."
"Lesions in the supramarginal and angular gyri  of the dominant hemisphere result in one or more of the following clinical symptoms of Gerstmann’s syndrome:  dysgraphia , a condition in which the affected individual has difficulty writing although the sensory and motor systems are intact;  dyscalculia, a condition in which the individual has difficulty making calculations, right–left confusion, and finger agnosia ; and  dyslexia, in which the lesion interferes with the ability to read. Lesions in the parietal association area that involve the inferior parietal lobule result in the following deficits:  distorted concepts of body image, in which the individual is not aware of the left side of his body ;  a lack of awareness that he is ill;  disorientation, for example he does not know where objects are located in his house, or where locations are on a map; and  an inability to draw simple figures. The onset of seizures in a previously healthy individual without a history of seizure mandates careful evaluation."
"Brain imaging is required, preferably with MRI . MRI in the patient discussed revealed a meningioma over the midlateral aspect of the left hemisphere, in the vicinity of the primary motor cortical area. The first seizure experienced by this patient was a focal motor, or simple partial, seizure."
"Normal consciousness was maintained and motor manifestations occured only on the contralateral side to where the brain focus of the seizure was. In this case, the seizure focus began in or around the facial part of the left primary motor cortex and spread progressively to involve the upper extremity and then the lower extremity part of the primary motor cortex . This is referred to as a Jacksonian march or Jacksonian seizure."
"It is rare to see the full march of clonic activity, but it is historically and conceptually important to know about it. The second seizure almost certainly had its onset in the same spot as the first one, except that this one spread rapidly and became generalized, i. e."
", involving both hemispheres. This generalization results in loss of consciousness and often generalized convulsions . Tongue biting and/or urinary incontinence is also often associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures."
"When there is alteration of consciousness with a seizure but it is not generalized, it is called complex partial. Seizures are a cortical phenomenon. A seizure indicates an abnormality of the electrophysiology of the cortical neurons."
"The full electrophysiology of seizure initiation and progression is beyond the scope of this discussion. The cortical neurons become hyperexcitable and typically produce “positive” symptoms rather than symptoms indicating loss of function. The manifestations of seizures are widely varied, and depend on which part of the cerebral cortex is affected."
"The most “epileptogenic” regions, in descending order, are the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and occipital lobes. Seizures are either primary or secondary. A secondary etiology is more common with new-onset seizures in adults, and can be caused by strokes, tumors, vascular malformations, hemorrhage, and any other lesion causing cortical irritation."
"Subcortical lesions do not cause seizures. Primary seizures are more common in children, who often “outgrow” them, and there is no identifiable lesion on brain imaging. There is often a hereditary component."
"However, seizures in children can certainly be secondary and new-onset seizures in adults can be primary . Question 1: Although these two anatomical components of the nervous system are treated as if they were separate entities, they are in fact intimately related to one another. Although the central nervous system is housed in the skull and spinal column, many of its neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the brain and in the spinal cord, have processes that leave the confines of their bony housing and enter other regions of the body."
"Here they are referred to as nerve fibers of the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, in many instances, the peripheral nervous system is an extension of the central nervous system. Question 3: Oligodendroglia are one of the types of neuroglia located in the central nervous system."
"These cells act as “insulators,” protecting neurons from coming into contact with extraneous cells and/or elements located in the central nervous system. Since most neurons have numerous processes, many of which may be quite long, each neuron requires a large number of oligodendroglia to form that physical barrier. Question 5: There is little voluntary control over a two neuron reflex arc."
"As an example, the patellar reflex, which is a two neuron reflex arc, cannot be suppressed by an individual. However, due to the presence of the interneuron in a three neuron reflex arc, the motor action of the three neuron reflex arc can be suppressed. As an example, the normal reflex in response to a needle prick to the finger tip is to withdraw the finger from harm’s way; however, if the finger is being pricked in a physician’s office for the purposes of a blood test, the patient, although aware of the pain, will  suppress the withdrawal component of the reflex."
"Question 1: The process of transforming the embryoblast to a trilaminar germ disc is known as gastrulation. This process establishes the presence of the three germ layers—the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—each of which will be responsible for the development of specific structures of the body. As an example, the ectoderm gives rise to the central nervous system, the mesoderm to the development of the vertebral column, and the endoderm to the epithelium of the gut."
"Question 3: Genes code for the synthesis of specific proteins, many of which are enzymes that are responsible for the occurrence of specific events. Certain genes have been conserved through evolution and their study in lower organisms, such as the fruitfly, has provided information that is directly applicable to the developmental processes of higher organisms, including humans. A family of genes, known as the homeobox genes, code for the synthesis of transcription factors, proteins that bind to and regulate the expression of other genes."
"The time sequence of the events controlled by products of these homeobox genes and by growth factors are essential for normal development because certain genes can be switched on only if some other genes have already been activated and if still other genes have not as yet been switched on. In other words, there are “windows of opportunity” for the occurrence of certain events and if that timeframe is missed then development will not proceed normally. Therefore, these homeobox genes become activated in a specific order, and their sequential expression establishes a pattern of developmental events."
"In order for development to progress in a normal manner, cells must interact with each other. These interactions may involve the physical contact of two cells or the release of a particular substance by one cell, referred to as the signaling cell, to act as a message for the other cell, known as the target cell. Question 5: Both develop as an outgrowth of the forming brain and an invagination of the ectoderm."
"The pituitary: The infundibulum of the diencephalon is a downward evagination of the floor of the third ventricle. As the infundibulum grows down, it meets an ectodermal diverticulum of the oral cavity, known as Rathke’s pouch. These two structures fuse with each other to form the  pituitary gland ."
"The neurohypophysis  arises from the infundibulum, whereas the adenohypophysis  derives from Rathke’s pouch. A small colloid-filled cleft frequently remains as a vestige of the lumen of Rathke’s pouch, in the pars intermedia. The eye: During the third week of gestation, the ventrolateral wall on each side of the future diencephalon gives rise to an optic vesicle."
"These hollow vesicles grow in a lateral direction; they reach and induce the ectoderm to form the lens placode, the precursor of the lens of the eye. The optic vesicle invaginates to form a two-layered structure, known as the optic cup, which gives rise to the nervous and pigmented layers of the retina; the connection between the optic cup and the forming brain becomes known as the optic stalk, the future optic nerve. The rim of the optic cup encircles the prospective lens to form the iris."
"Question 1: Although the soma of a neuron is relatively large, the axon and dendrites of many neurons possess a lot more cytoplasm than does the cell body. Therefore, the soma is responsible for the formation of much of the protein, macromolecules, and neurotransmitter material that the entire cell requires. Because of this high biosynthetic demand, the neuron must be equipped with the biosynthetic machinery to manufacture these substances."
"Since the soma is the only expanded portion of the neuron, its organelles must be localized at that site. Question 3: Since the intracellular concentration of K+ is greater than the extracellular concentration, potassium is driven by a concentration gradient from the cell into the extracellular space. Potassium ions travel through ion channels that are not gated and are known as K+ leak channels."
"Because only K+ ions are permitted through these channels an electrical imbalance is established . At the point where the concentration gradient’s “desire” to push potassium out of the cell and the electrical imbalance’s “desire” to return potassium into the cell equal each other, the net flow of K+ ions becomes zero. This does not mean that there is no flow of K+ ions across the membrane, it simply means that the same number of K+ ions flow into the cell as out of the cell."
"The establishment of this equilibrium potential  is described by the Nernst equation. This equation can be applied for all ions, and is solved for the most common ions. However, the Nernst equation assumes that only the particular ion in question is permitted to traverse the cell membrane."
"However, this is not a true situation as ion channels of the plasma membrane are open simultaneously, thus permitting several ions to cross the plasmalemma. The Goldman equation describes the membrane potential as a function of the relative permeability of the cell membrane to more than a single species of ions. Since the neuron membrane is influenced by at least three ions—Na+, K+, and Cl– —all three are considered in the Goldman equation."
"The Goldman equation is very similar to the Nernst equation, but it considers more than just a single ion type. It is interesting to note that the two equations would be identical if the permeability of two of the three ions were zero. Therefore, the Goldman equation describes the complexity of the existing situation better than does the Nernst equation and provides a more realistic prediction of resting membrane potential for neurons."
"Question 5: An increase in the number of postsynaptic potentials , results in their summation. Hence, hundreds of nearly simultaneous, small postsynaptic potentials may be necessary to achieve the threshold required for the formation of an action potential when those currents arrive at the initial segment of the axon. Generally, inhibitory synapses are closer to the initial segment of the axon than are excitatory synapses."
"Since inhibitory synapses function to hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane, they tend to diminish the flow of currents formed at the excitatory potential making it more difficult to reach threshold levels at the initial segment of the axon. This sequence of events is referred to as the summation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Question 1: The neurotransmitter substances that bind specifically to ligand-gated ion channels cause those channels to open directly, thus the target neuron responds immediately, resulting in an ionotropic effect."
"Those neurotransmitter substances that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors exert an indirect effect on ion channels. Since the G-proteins act as intermediaries, the effect on the target neuron is slower than in the previous instance. Thus, these neurotransmitter substances are known as neuromodulators, and they are said to exert a metabotropic effect."
"Question 3: Biogenic amines are derived from amino acids and exert a metabotropic effect. They bind to G-proteincoupled receptors and activate the second messenger system within the target neuron, which in turn will open ion channels. These substances include the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine as well as histamine and serotonin."
"Upon release from the presynaptic terminal, biogenic amines are endocytosed by the nerve terminals and glial cells, and are digested by the enzymes cathecol O-methyltranferase and monoamine oxidase. In this fashion, each release of these neurotransmitters is responsible for only a limited number of depolarizations/hyperpolarizations. Question 5: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter substance localized both in the central and peripheral nervous systems."
"It is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from acetyl CoA and choline by choline acetyl transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of its synthesis. Acetylcholine has the ability to bind to both ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. In skeletal muscle it is an excitatory neurotransmitter substance, binding directly to ligand-gated sodium  as well as to potassium ion channels, and causing them to open."
"In cardiac muscle it is an inhibitory neurotransmitter substance, binding to G-protein-linked receptors  that facilitate the opening of potassium ion channels. Question 1: The cervical and lumbar enlargements are necessary to provide space for the many neurons that are required for the innervation of the upper and lower extremities, respectively. Because the upper extremity is much more complex in humans, in that the hands and fingers possess a very rich nerve supply, the cervical enlargement is greater than the lumbar enlargement."
"Question 3: White matter is composed mostly of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers, which bring information into the central nervous system and transmit it to higher levels, and transmit information from higher levels to the spinal cord and to the muscles and glands. Based on the presence of sulci and fissures, the white matter is subdivided into three major columns, dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi. Within the funiculi the nerve fibers that have similar destinations are arranged in bundles known as tracts ."
"Question 5: The spinal cord equals the length of the vertebral canal only until the end of the first trimester of prenatal life. Thereafter the trunk elongates much faster, so that by the time of birth the conus medullaris is only at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and in the adult it extends only as far as the caudal aspect of the first lumbar vertebra. Therefore, lower levels of the spinal cord segments are displaced rostrally in relation to their corresponding vertebral levels."
"Because of this differential growth, the subarachnoid space caudal to the conus medullaris, known as the lumbar cistern, is devoid of spinal cord. It is this space that may be used by physicians to remove cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic purposes without causing injury to the spinal cord. Question 1: They are the commissural, projection, and association fibers."
"Commissural fibers connect the right and left cerebral hemispheres. Projection fibers connect the cerebral cortex to lower levels, namely the corpus striatum, diencephalon, brainstem, and spinal cord; the majority of these fibers are axons of pyramidal cells and fusiform neurons. Association fibers are restricted to a single hemisphere."
"Question 3: Peduncles are large fiber tracts that connect parts of the brain to the brainstem. There are two separate groups of peduncles, the cerebral and cerebellar peduncles. The cerebral peduncles are two very large, thick fiber bundles that connect the cerebral hemispheres to the brainstem."
"The cerebellar peduncles are three pairs of fiber bundles that connect the cerebellum to the midbrain, pons, and medulla of the brainstem. Question 1: The dura mater of the spinal cord differs from that of the cranial dura mater because the spinal dura is composed only of the meningeal layer. The periosteal layer is the true periosteum of the vertebral canal and is separated from the meningeal layer by a loose connective tissue and fat-filled epidural space."
"Question 3: Although the brain itself may not feel pain, the dura mater possesses a very rich sensory nerve supply, derived mostly from cranial nerve V  but also from the first three cervical spinal nerves that serve the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa. It is these sensory fibers that become stimulated and the patient may experience severe pain. Question 5: Arachnoid granulations are small, mushroomshaped evaginations of the arachnoid that protrude into the lumen of the dural sinuses."
"Most of the arachnoid granulations are associated with the lacunae lateralis—diverticula of the superior sagittal sinus—although some jut into the lumen of the sinus. The core of an arachnoid granulation is continuous with the subarachnoid space and is surrounded by the epithelioid layer of the arachnoid and the dura, forming a membrane that is two cell layers thick. As the arachnoid granulation evaginates into the lacuna lateralis it is invested by some cellular and collagenous elements of the meningeal dura mater, which in turn is surrounded by the endothelial lining of the blood vessel."
"Cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid space enters into the core of the arachnoid granulation and from there penetrates, probably by osmosis, the epithelioid layers of the arachnoid granulations and the endothelial lining to escape into the lacuna lateralis. Therefore, the function of the arachnoid granulations is transporting cerebrospinal fluid manufactured by the choroid plexuses of the brain ventricles into the vascular system. It is important to note that although the arachnoid granulations protrude into the venous sinuses, they are always separated from the blood by the endothelial lining of the dural sinus/lacuna lateralis."
"Question 1: Radicular arteries are extremely important for the vascularization of the spinal cord because, with the exception of the cervical region, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries by themselves are unable to provide an adequate vascular supply to the spinal cord. Therefore, an injury to a spinal nerve damages not only the afferent and efferent fibers of a particular spinal cord level, but may also damage the segmental white and gray matter by producing ischemic conditions due to the reduction in blood supply from the radicular artery serving that region. Question 3: The posterior communicating artery connects the cerebral portion of the internal carotid artery to the posterior cerebral branch of the basilar artery."
"The right and left arteries are not identical, in that one is frequently smaller than the other, and, in fact, one may be entirely absent or doubled. The main function of this vessel is to ensure a viable blood supply to the brain in case the internal carotid or vertebral artery becomes occluded. However, it also has central branches that pierce the region of the base of the cerebrum and serve part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the medial aspect of the thalamus, and the tissue forming the lateral border of the third ventricle."
"Question 5: Four major vessels—the two internal carotid arteries and the two vertebral arteries—bring blood to the brain. Although numerous veins receive blood from the brain, they all deliver their contents into the venous sinuses of the meninges. The venous sinuses, in turn, deliver their blood into the superior bulb of the right and left internal jugular veins."
"Question 1: Preganglionic sympathetic soma are located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord only at levels T1 through L2, therefore the preganglionic fibers are located only in the corresponding spinal nerves. They leave the spinal nerves via the white rami communicantes to join the sympathetic chain ganglia. There they may synapse with postganglionic sympathetic soma at various levels along the sympathetic trunk."
"Postganglionic sympathetic fibers of these soma re-enter the spinal nerve  at the level that leads to the region of their destination. Since there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves there has to be a corresponding gray rami communicantes for each spinal nerve. Question 3: The autonomic nervous system is designed in such a fashion that preganglionic fibers can synapse only with their own postganglionic soma, therefore a preganglionic parasympathetic fiber cannot synapse with a postganglionic sympathetic soma."
"The postganglionic soma can thus only be stimulated by its own preganglionic neuron. However, a target cell, such as the conducting system of the heart, may be innervated by both postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers and the target cell has to know whether it is responding to a sympathetic or a parasympathetic message. Question 5: As feces accumulate, the sigmoid colon distends and the individual becomes conscious of the need to defecate, but the feces are retained in the colon by the two sphincter muscles, the internal smooth muscle sphincter and the external skeletal muscle sphincter."
"The former is supplied by postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the hypogastric plexus as well as by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers located in Auerbach’s plexus . The external sphincter is supplied by the somatic nervous system, namely the inferior rectal nerve. Thus, when the sigmoid colon becomes distended, the internal sphincter muscle relaxes  and at the same time the external sphincter muscle contracts, preventing the feces from exiting the bowel."
"While the individual is asleep, this contraction of the external sphincter muscle is a reflex response. When the individual is awake, the contraction of the external sphincter is a voluntary response. Question 1: Some receptors respond quickly and maximally at the onset of the stimulus, but stop responding even if the stimulus continues; these are known as rapidly adapting  receptors."
"They are essential in responding to changes but they ignore ongoing processes, such as when one wears a wristwatch and ignores its presence and continuous pressure on the skin of the wrist. However, there are other receptors, slowly adapting  receptors, that continue to respond as long as the stimulus is present. Question 3: It is the degree of stretching that is proportional to the load placed on the muscle."
"The larger the load, the more strongly the spindles are depolarized and the more extrafusal muscle fibers are in turn activated. Question 5: Pain perception is not only processed in the primary somatosensory cortex, but also in the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. Recent studies support the finding that pain sensation persists following a lesion to the primary somatosensory cortex as a result of these additional cortical representations of pain."
"Question 1: By alpha and gamma motoneuron coactivation. When the gross muscle contracts , the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers undergo a simultaneous corresponding contraction , stretching their central noncontractile portion. The muscle spindles are then ready to detect muscle stretch when the muscle becomes stretched from the contracted state or from any length."
"Therefore, when the gross muscle begins to stretch from the contracted state, the intrafusal fibers will be immediately stretched and their afferent  fibers will fire, informing the central nervous system that muscle stretching is occurring. Question 3: Although the upper motoneurons arising from the primary motor cortex may be damaged, the tectospinal, reticulospinal, and vestibulospinal tracts and the upper motoneurons contributed by the secondary motor cortex provide a motor input to the interneurons and lower motoneurons innervating the skeletal muscles. Question 5: The cortical group, which includes the lateral corticospinal tract."
"Question 1: The limbic system consists of a group of cortical and subcortical structures that are involved in the processing of emotions. Via its connections to the basal ganglia, the limbic system can influence the underlying motivational aspects of behavior or movement. Here is an example of the role played by the limbic system in movement."
"The pleasant aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked cinnamon rolls are enough to motivate anyone of us to walk toward the coffee and cinnamon rolls and taste them by lifting the coffee cup and roll to take a sip and a few bites. Tasting the cinnamon roll may elicit certain facial expressions that may indicate to those looking at us that we are enjoying the delicious tasting cinnamon roll. Furthermore, the warm cinnamon aroma may evoke fond memories of the first time we tasted a cinnamon roll."
"In this example, the olfactory system , the limbic system , and the basal ganglia involved in movement are all interconnected. Question 3: Normally, the subthalamic nucleus projects glutaminergic  fibers to the two output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the medial segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, which in turn send inhibitory projections to the thalamus. Thalamocortical fibers that are excitatory project to the motor cortex."
"Projections up to this point are ipsilateral; however, the upper motoneurons arising from the cortex decussate in the pyramids, thus affecting the opposite side of the body. A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus would result in disinhibition  of the thalamus, which in turn becomes overactive, overstimulating the motor cortex, which in turn results in hyperkinetic symptoms in the opposite side of the body. Question 5: If excessive l-DOPA is administered to an individual with Parkinson’s disease, the individual will manifest choreic movements."
l-DOPA administered to a patient with Huntington’s disease will intensify the choreic movements. Question 1: The cerebellar efferents and the descending motor pathways  are crossed. Thus a lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere via its efferents  affects the left side of the brain.
"As the left corticospinal tract descends to the pyramids, most of its fibers cross to the opposite  side as the lateral corticospinal tract, terminating in the right spinal cord, and synapsing with lower motoneurons that innervate the muscles on the right side of the body. The corticorubral fibers arising from the left side of the brain descend to the left red nucleus, which in turn gives rise to the rubrospinal tract whose fibers cross to the right side in the midbrain. The right rubrospinal tract will descend to terminate on lower motoneurons in the right spinal cord that innervate muscles on the right side of the body."
"Question 3: The hemispheric  zone of the cerebellum. It is interesting to note that although both motor and cognitive functions are affected by the consumption of alcohol, the cells of the cerebellum are very susceptible to the effects of alcohol. This becomes apparent by the awkward, ataxic, uncoordinated execution of movements by the intoxicated individual, especially when the eyes are closed."
"Question 5: A decrease in resistance to passive manipulation resulting in excess movement of the limbs  is caused by the absence of cerebellar influence on the stretch reflex. Question 1: Nociceptive input from the body is transmitted to the spinal cord dorsal horn by first order pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia. Second order neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, give rise to axons that ascend as the spinothalamic or spinoreticular tracts."
"The spinothalamic tract terminates in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus, but also sends collaterals to the brainstem reticular formation. The spinoreticular tract terminates in the reticular formation, and also sends collateral to the thalamus. Nociceptive input from the orofacial region is transmitted to the pons by the pseudounipolar neurons whose cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglion."
"Fibers conveying nociceptive input descend in the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve to terminate in the subnucleus caudalis of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. This nucleus also receives the central processes of sensory neurons of other cranial nerves relaying nociceptive input from structures in the head. Second order neurons housed in the subnucleus caudalis cross to the opposite side of the pons, and join the ventral trigeminal lemniscus to terminate in the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus with collaterals to the reticular formation."
"Question 3: Through their ascending fibers the neurons of the medial zone influence the autonomic nervous system, and the level of arousal. Via their descending fibers, which join the reticulospinal tracts, the neurons of the medial zone influence the motor control of the axial and proximal limb musculature. Question 5: Lesions damaging the midbrain reticular formation can cause hypersomnia associated with slow respiration."
"When the midbrain is compressed with consequent extensive damage of the ARAS pathways, a comatose state ensues. Question 1: Interruption of the parasympathetic innervation of the sphincter pupillae muscle causes the pupil ipsilateral to the lesion to remain dilated  and to not respond  to a flash of light. This may be the first clinical sign of intracranial pressure on the general visceral efferent fibers of the oculomotor nerve."
"The ciliary muscle is also nonfunctional due to interruption of its parasympathetic innervation, and cannot accommodate the lens for near vision . Question 3: The abducens nucleus innervates a single extraocular muscle, the lateral rectus. A lesion in the abducens nucleus damages not only the general somatic efferent  motor fibers innervating the lateral rectus muscle, but also the internuclear fibers projecting to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus, that synapse with the motoneurons that innervate the medial rectus."
"A lesion in the abducens nucleus that damages the GSE motor fibers innervating the lateral rectus results in paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle, which normally abducts the eye. Since the individual will be unable to move the ipsilateral eye laterally, it deviates medially as a result of the unopposed action of the medial rectus. The individual can turn the ipsilateral eye from its medial position to the center , but not beyond it."
"This paralysis results in medial strabismus . Since the eyes become misaligned, the individual experiences horizontal diplopia . The diplopia is greatest when looking toward the side of the lesion and is reduced by looking towards the unaffected side since the visual axes become parallel."
The individual realizes that the diplopia is minimized by turning his head slightly so that the chin is pointing toward the side of the lesion. Bilateral abducent nerve lesion results in the individual becoming “cross-eyed. ” A lesion involving the abducens nucleus damaging the internuclear neurons results in the inability to turn the opposite eye medially as the individual attempts to gaze toward the side of the lesion.
"This condition is referred to as lateral gaze paralysis. Question 5: A lesion in the vicinity of the abducens nucleus that involves the entire ipsilateral abducens nucleus as well as the decussating medial longitudinal fasciculus fibers arising from the contralateral abducens nucleus, results in a rare condition referred to as “one-and-a-half. ” If, for example, a lesion is present in the vicinity of the left abducens nucleus the following will occur."
1 The GSE motoneurons whose axons form the left abducent nerve innervating the left lateral rectus are damaged. Therefore that lateral rectus muscle is paralyzed. 2 The internuclear neurons housed in the left abducens nucleus are also damaged.
Therefore their crossing fibers do not form excitatory synapses with the motoneurons of the contralateral oculomotor nucleus that innervate the right medial rectus muscle. 3 The crossing fibers of the internuclear neurons arising from the contralateral  abducens nucleus are also damaged. Thus they do not form excitatory synapses with the motoneurons of the left oculomotor nucleus that innervate the left medial rectus.
"Therefore, when attempting to gaze to the left, the left eye will not abduct and the right eye will not adduct during conjugate horizontal gaze to the left. When attempting to gaze to the right, the right eye responds normally, that is it is able to abduct, whereas the left eye will not be able to adduct during conjugate horizontal gaze to the right. It is important to note that the innervation to all the extraocular muscles of both eyes is intact, except to one—the left lateral rectus."
"If you ask this individual to look at a near object placed directly in front of his face, both eyes will converge since both medial recti and their innervation  are intact. This type of lesion becomes apparent only during conjugate horizontal eye movement. Question 7: The first cranial nerve that is likely to be damaged from a growing pituitary tumor is the optic nerve."
"The decussating axons at the optic chiasma will be compressed, followed by the nondecussating fibers. If the tumor becomes very large, the cranial nerves located on the medial wall of the cavernous sinus  will likely be compressed and cause deficits in the structures that these nerves innervate. Question 1: Although light travels from the inner to the outer layers of the retina , visual electrical signals are transmitted in the opposite direction from the outer to the inner layers of the retina ."
"Question 3: When the right eye was illuminated, only the consensual  papillary light reflex was elicited. This indicates that a lesion may be present in the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex arc of the right side. When the left eye was illuminated, again, only the left eye responded, which indicates that the lesion may be present in the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex arc on the right side."
"Question 5: The patient had a lesion affecting the ganglion cell axons arising from the nasal half of each retina, which cross at the optic chiasma over the body of the sphenoid bone. The crossing fibers may be damaged due to compression by a tumor of the pituitary gland. Queston 1: The middle ear functions in the transmission and transduction of tympanic membrane vibrations to the inner ear ."
"The oval window and the round window both serve necessary functions in these processes. Question 3: The basilar membrane is an elastic structure exhibiting a gradual increase in width, and a decrease in stiffness from the oval window  to the helicotrema . The gradual decrease in stiffness permits this membrane to be sensitive to high frequency vibrations near the cochlear base, and low frequency vibrations near its apex, at the helicotrema."
"Question 5: The olivocochlear bundle has an inhibitory effect on cochlear nerve activity, modulating and sharpening auditory transmission. Question 1: Sensory input from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems, is integrated by the nervous system, especially the cerebellum, to generate motor responses. These motor responses maintain equilibrium, posture, and muscle tone, as well as reflex movements of the eyes, all of which are carried out at the subconscious level."
"Question 3: The neuroepithelia of the cristae ampullares, macula utriculi, and macula sacculi are covered with a gelatinous glycoprotein membrane. The stereocilia and kinocilia are embedded in this membrane. In the utricle and saccule, the gelatinous glycoprotein membranes overlying their macula have, on their free surface, otoconia —also referred to as otoliths —which are crystals consisting of calcium carbonate."
"Since the gelatinous glycoprotein membrane of the utricle and saccule has otoliths, it is referred to as the otolithic membrane, and the utricle and saccule are referred to as otolithic organs. The otoliths have a specific gravity that is greater than that of the endolymph which surrounds them, and they are consequently pulled by gravity. Gravity applies a continuous linear acceleration on the head, and thus deflects the gelatinous membrane, which in turn stimulates the hair cells."
"The glycoprotein membrane of the cristae ampullares is dome-shaped and is called the cupula; it is devoid of crystals. The cupula increases resistance to the flow of endolymph and, unlike the otolithic membrane, is not influenced by gravitational forces. Instead, it responds to endolymphatic flow."
The cupula is a mechanical structure that narrows the lumen of the canal and so increases resistance to flow. The three cristae ampullares are enclosed in the semicircular duct ampullae  and detect angular acceleration or deceleration  of the head . The receptors in the utricle and saccule  detect spatial orientation of the head in space relative to gravity and linear acceleration or deceleration forces.
"Question 5: The vestibular nerve is unique since it is the only cranial nerve that sends some of its first order afferent fibers relaying sensory input directly from the peripheral receptors to the cerebellar cortex. The vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum serve as the first relay centers of the vestibular pathway. Question 7: When an individual fixes his gaze on  an object and then begins to turn his head, for example to the right, the eyes will reflexly  “turn” to the left , which is opposite to the direction of head movement."
"This turning of the eyes  compensates for shifting of the head position in order to maintain visual fixation on an object. Without this vestibular reflex mechanism coupling head and eye movements, as the erect head moves from a certain position  the eyes would remain still, perceiving a changing visual field during the head movement. Question 1: Olfactory receptor cells, the first order bipolar neurons of the olfactory pathway, reside in a peripheral structure, the olfactory epithelium ."
"They are the only neurons that are in direct contact with the environment and they give rise to unmyelinated axons, the slowest impulse-conducting axons of the central nervous system. They serve the functions of:  sensory receptors ;  transducers ; and  first order neurons . Question 3: Odorant-receptor molecules  are embedded in the plasmalemma of the ciliary membrane of the olfactory receptor cells."
"Question 5: The binding of an odorous substance to the odorant-receptor protein molecules , stimulates the initiation of a second messenger pathway associated with an olfactoryspecific G-protein, which subsequently stimulates adenyl cyclase, which generates cAMP. The cAMP elevation unlocks a cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel embedded in the ciliary membrane, permitting sodium and calcium cations to pass into the cell. This stimulates the chemosensitive cilia of the olfactory receptor cells, and a wave of depolarization  is propagated from the dendrites to the cell body of the olfactory receptor cell."
"A high enough depolarization triggers a nerve impulse that is propagated along the axon of the olfactory receptor cell, centrally to the olfactory bulb. Question 1: The limbic lobe consists of the subcallosal, cingulate, and parahippocampal gyri, as well as the hippocampal formation, all of which collectively form a cortical perimeter around the corpus callosum. The limbic lobe is considered to be a component of the more extensive limbic system."
"The limbic system includes all the structures of the limbic lobe as well as the amygdaloid body, septal area, and some nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus. The two main structures of the limbic system are the hippocampal formation  and the amygdala. Question 3: The dentate gyrus gets its name from its toothlike configuration, created by numerous blood vessels that pierce the ventricular surface of the hippocampus and then the dentate gyrus, imparting a notched appearance."
Question 5: The entorhinal cortex. Widespread areas of the association cortex relay input to the entorhinal cortex and it is via the entorhinal cortex that these cortical association areas have access to the hippocampus and play a role in memory consolidation. Question 7: The hypothalamus mediates autonomic nervous system  responses that accompany the expression of emotions.
"Question 9: The perforant pathway from the entorhinal cortex. Question 1: The nuclei of this zone include the periventricular, suprachiasmatic, and arcuate nuclei. The periventricular and arcuate nuclei control the functions of the anterior  pituitary gland , which synthesizes and releases various endocrine hormones into the bloodstream."
"The suprachiasmatic nucleus functions in the control of circadian rhythms, and is referred to as the “master clock” of the body. Question 3: The lateral zone of the hypothalamus includes the following nuclei: the lateral preoptic nucleus anteriorly, the lateral tuberal nuclei in the tuberal region, and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, which extends throughout the anteroposterior extent of the lateral zone. The lateral zone receives input from the limbic system and plays an important role in the behavioral expression of emotions."
"Question 5: The supraoptic region contains nuclei that function in the control of circadian rhythms, temperature regulation, and the control of water balance. Question 7: The mammillary region includes the prominent mammillary nuclei and the posterior hypothalamic nucleus. The mammillary nuclei are associated with emotions, whereas the posterior hypothalamic nucleus serves as a “thermostat” and regulates body temperature."
"Question 9: In addition to the neural input, the hypothalamus also receives non-neural input from the vascular system. Hypothalamic neurons serve as receptors that are sensitive to rapid changes in the temperature, osmotic pressure, and hormone levels of the circulating blood. These receptors are referred to as circumventricular organs ."
"They consist of hypothalamic neurons that are embedded in the wall of the third ventricle, and are sensitive to alterations in the chemical composition of the cerebrospinal fluid. One of these structures is associated with the lamina terminalis, and is referred to as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis . The OVLT is a chemosensory structure that detects and responds to peptides and macromolecules present in the bloodstream."
"The other CVO is the subfornical organ located inferior to the fornix, near the interventricular foramen. The subfornical organ serves in the regulation of body fluids. The fenestrated capillaries supplying these receptors do not have a blood–brain barrier, thus they permit substances present in the bloodstream to pass through and enter the extracellular space surrounding the receptor cells."
"Question 11: The fornix. Question 13: The ascending reticular activating system relays nociceptive input to the hypothalamus, which mediates the autonomic and reflex responses to nociception. Question 15: The tuberohypophyseal tract carries fibers from the arcuate and periventricular nuclei to the infundibular stalk ."
"The axon terminals of the tuberohypophyseal tract release “releasing hormones” or “releaseinhibiting hormones” in the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, where they regulate the synthesis and release of anterior pituitary hormones. The tuberohypophyseal tract and the hypophyseal portal system serve as a connection between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. Question 17: There are two main problems that might cause this condition:  a blockage of the superior hypophyseal artery, thus depriving the anterior pituitary of nutrition; or  a lesion in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus."
"Question 1: The anterior nuclear group, a relay nucleus of the Papez circuit of emotion, has extensive connections with the limbic system. It receives afferent fibers relaying information from the mammillary body and the hippocampal formation. It in turn projects to the cingulate gyrus of the limbic association cortex."
"Due to its limbic connections, the anterior nuclear group functions in the expression of emotions and, due to its considerable connections with the hippocampal formation, this nuclear group is also believed to be associated with learning and memory processes. The lateral dorsal nucleus  is the caudal continuation of the anterior thalamic nuclear group and may play a role in the expression of emotions. Like the anterior thalamic nuclear group, it receives inputs from the mammillary body and in turn projects to the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri of the limbic system."
"The dorsomedial nucleus  also functions in the processing of information related to emotion via its connections to the limbic system components such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. Question 3: The posterior portion of the ventral lateral  nucleus receives prominent projections arising from the deep cerebellar nuclei  of the opposite side, via the dentatothalamic tract. The VLp then relays the information to the premotor and primary motor cortex ."
"Question 5: The nonspecific nuclei of the thalamus, which includes the intralaminar and reticular thalamic nuclei. Question 1: Most of the cerebral cortex consists of association cortex, which is classified into unimodal association cortex and multimodal  association cortex. Unimodal association areas are located next to, near, or around the primary sensory cortices that expand on the functions of the respective primary areas."
"As an example, the primary visual cortex  projects to the visual association cortex , and only processes a single modality, in this case vision, and is thus referred to as a unimodal association cortex. In contrast, the multimodal association cortical areas receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities; they then integrate the information and, via their higher order cognitive functions, formulate a composite experience. The multimodal association cortex is associated with imagination, judgement, decision making, and making long-range plans."
"Question 3: Studies of patients who had their corpus callosum sectioned showed the following. When patients were asked to read words that were presented in their right visual field, they were able see and to read the words. However, when words were presented in their left visual field, they could not read them, since they were not even aware that the words were there."
"One explanation is as follows. Visual information in the right visual field is relayed to the left cerebral hemisphere , which is the dominant hemisphere in the processing of language in most individuals. Thus the patients were able to see and read the words."
"In contrast, visual input from the left visual field is relayed to the right cerebral hemisphere , the nondominant hemisphere for language. As a result of the bisection of the corpus callosum, the visual input relayed to the right cerebral hemisphere has no way of also reaching the left hemisphere containing the language areas. Consequently, patients could not see or read the words —as if they had a left homonymous hemianopia."
"These individuals are not blind. When they were asked to select with their hand an object that corresponds to the object that was presented in their left visual field, they selected the matching object. This showed that the visual system is functioning properly, and that it is the language function that is not."
"Question 5: Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas are supplied by the middle cerebral artery. This vessel has an extensive distribution and supplies parts of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. If only the cortical branches of the middle cerebral artery supplying Broca’s area are occluded, the cerebral cortex of Broca’s area becomes infarcted, resulting in Broca’s aphasia."
"If the proximal segment of the middle cerebral artery is occluded, the cerebral cortex of the insula and subcortical white matter will also become infarcted, and a severe form of Broca’s aphasia results, which is accompanied by motor deficits in the contralateral lower face, tongue, and upper limb. If only the cortical branches of the middle cerebral artery supplying Wernicke’s area are occluded, the cerebral cortex of Wernicke’s area becomes infarcted, resulting in Wernicke’s aphasia. If the subcortical white matter and geniculocalcarine tract  are also involved, visual deficits will also be present."
"Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, the collection of nerve cells that interpret all sorts of information which allows the body to coordinate activity in response to the environment. The study of neuroscience has taught us that the brain is a complicated organ with several connection routes, both between different bodily organs and within itself. Some of those connections communicate information down towards the body, such as signals that allow us to control the movements of our muscles or to change the activity of our internal organs."
"Other connections ascend into the brain, conveying all sorts of information from the world around us into a representation of our surroundings. Still, other routes communicate between brain areas, such as when the sudden detection of a threat passes through our visual system and turns into a “get ready” signal that then prepares the rest of our body for conflict. Because of this complex system of communication, the nervous system can be thought of as a series of highways and roads that connect different cities ."
"The nervous system conveys all of these different types of information using a combination of electrical and chemical signals. The main active cellular units of the nervous system, the neurons, are highly sensitive to changes in their environment. A wide variety of chemicals called neurotransmitters are responsible for passing information between neurons."
"Realistically, our modern understanding of “neuroscience” is a combination of several academic disciplines, all using their strengths to understand some aspect of the nervous system. Because of this integrative nature, it is possible to study neuroscience from many different perspectives, each of them more fitting for answering different types of questions. These “angles” of analysis are described below."
"At the root of the study is biology. Whenever you are studying living processes, such as learning, visual perception, or consciousness, you dip into the realm of biology. The broad field of biology can be subdivided into smaller, more precise categories."
"Molecular neurobiologists study proteins and gene regulation, cellular neurobiologists examine how networks of neurons communicate with one another, and cognitive neuroscientists study the underlying causes of behaviors. Understanding neuroscience involves genetics, such as the autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition Huntington’s disease. Other biological sub-disciplines, such as ecology and evolution, are also considered in neuroscience as well, such as the parasite Toxoplasma, which changes an animal’s response to fearful stimuli, allowing the organism to reproduce as it moves through different species in the food web."
"Psychology provided the earliest explanations about the brain and ideas about the origin of the mind. Some questions in this field branched off from philosophy as people began thinking about the “mind–body problem”, the discussion that centered around the question of whether a function as complex as consciousness could result from the activity of a clump of cells. Psychologists also wondered whether parts of the brain in isolation have different properties than when those parts are working together."
"This property, called emergence, is the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Psychologists examine neuroscience from a top-down view, aiming questions at understanding the whole organism before looking at smaller components of the organism . Chemistry is a strong influencer of nervous system function—just ask anyone who forgot their morning cup of coffee! We use a variety of endogenous  chemicals that act as signaling molecules, allowing communication between cells."
"These chemicals exist in many different structures, which determine their function; some are acidic while others are basic, some are polar, others are fat-soluble, and some are even gases. The nervous system is also highly sensitive to influence by exogenous chemicals , such as caffeine and cocaine. Many principles of physics can be observed through the functioning of neurons."
"For example, neurons maintain a negative electrical charge, usually measured on the scale of tens of millivolts  The main way for neurons to send signals depends on a temporary change in this voltage; this signal is called an action potential. This change in voltage is brought on by the movement of charged ions across the cell membrane, and they closely follow the rules of magnetism: opposite charges attract while like charges repel. The field of computational neuroscience has grown from the use of mathematical modeling to describe or predict some aspect of the nervous system."
"If our current estimates are correct, we have around 86 billion neurons in the brain, a number so large that it is difficult to conceptualize. It would be nearly impossible to understand that many components of a system without taking advantage of the sheer mathematical strength of a computer. Healthcare providers, like neurologists and psychiatrists, work from a different angle."
"They coordinate closely with researchers to apply scientific knowledge from the field or laboratory to treat patients, thus using biological principles as therapies. For example, neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks used his knowledge of the dopamine neurotransmitter system to treat patients with a paralysis-like condition in the 1960s, leading to the development of levadopa treatment for Parkinson’s disease."
"Other healthcare providers use imaging strategies like a CT scan to assess the extent of a head injury or the location of a brain tumor, while an EEG can be helpful for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Engineers help develop the tools needed to understand questions in neuroscience, such as the patch clamp rig or electron microscope, highly specialized pieces of lab equipment. They also work closely with healthcare providers to translate science into therapy, such as the deep brain stimulator devices for the treatment of conditions such as Parkinson’s disease."
"Collectively, all the people who participate in neuroscience in some way are united by their interest in the workings of the body. Because of the overwhelming complexity of the nervous system, there are many questions still unanswered. The continual appearance of new questions in neuroscience keeps us wondering, inspires curiosity, and promises a multitude of fascinating career paths for centuries to come."
"The gold standard in science is the use of experimental design. In an experiment, the scientist uses a stepwise process of developing a research question and hypothesis, then answering that question by performing tests. The main goal of an experiment is to establish a causal relationship between one factor that is being changed, the independent variable, and the factor that is influenced, the dependent variable."
"A well-designed experiment has variables that are carefully controlled, which minimizes the influence of extraneous variables, often called confounding variables. The influence of confounding variables can be eliminated by comparing the experimental group with a control group, a group that is as similar as possible in every way except for the manipulation of the independent variable. Importantly, subjects or patients are generally assigned to the experimental or control group at random."
"Another strategy is the case study, a highly detailed description of a single patient and their condition. A case study documents the details regarding a specific deficit or enhancement and is an opportunity to examine individuals with very rare conditions, which are useful for informing about the functions of different brain structures. Like a quasi-experimental study, case studies only show correlation, not causation."
"It is difficult to generalize the findings from a case study to the population at large. Perhaps the most famous case study in all of neuroscience is the 1848 story of the railroad worker Phineas Gage. Gage was a construction foreman working on the railroad when an unfortunate explosive workplace accident caused a iron rod to be driven through his left frontal lobe, largely destroying it."
"Remarkably, Gage survived this accident and lived another 12 years. However, Gage’s acquaintances described subsequent changes in his personality, teaching us that one of the functions of this area of the brain is regulating our inhibitions. Case studies can be helpful for the development of hypotheses that can later be tested experimentally."
"For example, consider another famous case study of Patient HM, the man who had his left and right hippocampus surgically removed and couldn’t create certain types of memory. A research question based on this case study might be: “Is the hippocampus needed for the creation of navigational memory? ” Then, an experimental study could be performed in rodents, where we surgically remove the hippocampus  or a different part of the brain  and see how well the rodents perform on a memory task."
"Though there are many ways that we can directly study humans through experimentation or case studies,  it is often impossible to test every question in humans. Instead of always studying humans, scientists often use nonhuman model organisms, the most common organisms being the worm C. elegans, fruit flies , zebrafish , song birds, mice, rats, and macaque monkeys."
"The closer we move towards the human, the more similarities the model organism shares with us. Of the commonly used model organisms, macaque monkeys are the non-humans that are most similar to humans. We share 93% of our genetic material with macaques, but we still have different metabolic and physiological processes, and our behaviors are much different from theirs."
"Ethical constraints prevent us from performing experiments that may cause physical or psychological harm if performed in humans. We would never conduct a test on humans to assess what concentration of neurotoxin leads to brain damage . Invertebrates, such as worms and fruit flies are not as heavily regulated by ethics oversight committees, allowing scientists to conduct a wider set of experiments on these animals."
Our moral responsibilities toward animal subjects are that:  Animals should only be used in worthwhile experiments. All steps are taken to minimize pain and distress. All possible alternatives to animal research are considered.
"Research facilities at colleges and universities are monitored by an Institutional Care and Use Committee . The IACUC consists of fulltime veterinarians, scientists, and community members. They must follow federal laws when approving animal research."
"Performing an experiment in an intact, living organism, whether human or nonhuman, is described as an in vivo  preparation. The main strength of this strategy is that the data collected here are more predictive of the human condition, which is one of the main goals of biomedical research. However, the in vivo preparation has challenges, because thousands of variables within a living system are uncontrolled or still unknown."
"There are also very strict ethical limitations on the nature of experiments that can be done in vivo. On the other hand, an in vitro  preparation is an experiment performed on cultured cells or isolated molecules of DNA, RNA, or protein. These preparations have the opposite strengths and weaknesses of in vivo preparations."
"They allow for extremely good control over variables, but the results are less reliable in translating to a therapy. The regulations on these experiments are much more lax compared to in vivo experiments; most of the regulatory guidelines are to protect the experimenter rather than the patient or the experimental subject. Falling in between these two preparations is an ex vivo experiment."
"In this kind of experiment, a section of the living organism is taken, such as a slice of brain, a tissue biopsy, or a detached frog leg. The strengths and limitations of these experiments are somewhere in between that of the other two preparations. As complex as the brain is, naturally misconceptions make their way into popular culture."
"It’s valuable to address these myths about neuroscience and explain the evidence that refutes these statements. This wildly inaccurate statistic has been the foundation for several fictional movies, TV shows, and books. The truth is that we use every part of the brain, and most of our brain is active most of the time—just not at the same time."
Neurologist V. S. Ramachandran uses a great analogy to describe the fallacy of this myth: does a traffic light only use 33% of its lights?
"A properly functioning traffic light will use all three lights at very precise times. The activity of the brain is closely regulated by multiple mechanisms which prevent unusual electrical activity. In fact, if too many cells were active at the wrong times, just like a traffic light showing both green and red, chaos ensues—one cause of seizures is excessive neural activity."
"Another misconception is the idea that each new cell in our brain represents a new memory. While we are far from understanding the process of exactly how memories are formed in the brain, we do have a few clues. Most likely, memories are stored at the sites of close contact between neurons, called synapses."
"Changes in ways neurons connect and communicate with one another is likely the mechanism behind how memories are formed and stored, rather than the creation of new neurons. Even though the process of cell reproduction is halted in the majority of adult neurons, we are still capable of new neuronal growth, a process called neurogenesis. A few brain areas in particular, like the hippocampus , do exhibit frequent birth and death of new neurons."
"Myth 3: “The brain cannot repair itself. ” If neurons aren’t being replaced in adulthood, then how do people spontaneously recover from neurological injuries like a stroke? One of the most amazing features of the brain is the phenomenon of plasticity, the ability to change over time."
"Even if critical brain areas are damaged, it is theorized that the brain learns how to “rewire itself”, essentially figuring out how to carry out these functions without using the damaged connections. Unfortunately, there are some conditions that are neurodegenerative, meaning that their symptoms get progressively worse over time. Many of these disorders, like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, currently do not have any simple cures or treatments that don’t carry risks and side effects."
"For people with these conditions, there is not strong evidence that the brain can recover from the destruction caused by these diseases. Myth 4: “If you are analytical, you are left brain dominant, but if you are creative, you are right brain dominant. ” A common misconception is that the two hemispheres of the brain are responsible for wildly different functions."
"The truth is that nearly every function that the left half of the brain can do, the right half can do just as well, and vice versa. Sensory information, voluntary control of the muscles, memories, and many other behaviors can be performed equally well by both the left and right halves of the brain. A major exception to the “left vs."
"right” component is the processing and production of language. For some reason unknown to scientists, these functions are heavily lateralized in the left hemisphere for most people. Fascinatingly, we do have one strange quirk about signaling between the brain and the rest of the body: signaling pathways from the left brain crosses over to communicate with the right half of the body, and vice versa."
"This contralateral organization is an unintended consequence of evolution, and is one of the major distinguishing features of the vertebrate brain. One of the most exciting and satisfying aspects of modern science is the rapidity of new discoveries in the field. New findings are often communicated by publishing academic studies in scientific journals."
"More neuroscience studies were published between 2015 and 2020 than in the previous seventy years! But, advancements in neuroscience haven’t always moved so quickly. Trepanation was a surgical intervention that involved drilling a hole into an individual’s skull. It is believed to be one of the oldest surgical procedures according to archaeological evidence."
"Interestingly, skulls that show evidence of trepanation have been dated to 6500 BCE and show evidence of healing, indicating that the patient survived the surgery. For hundreds of years, physicians attempted to correlate behaviors with changes in the brain. In the mid 1800s, the physician Paul Broca contributed to localization theory by concluding that specific areas of the brain were responsible for carrying out specific functions."
"This idea was supported by ablation studies that demonstrated that when different brain structures were ablated, or lesioned, there were specific associated functional losses. Further, electrically exciting specific brain structures resulted in eliciting specific behaviors. Most likely, some behaviors are more localized than others, but still rely on signals from across many other brain areas."
"As with most fields of biology, absolutes are rare in neuroscience. The real strength of our brain is its flexibility: brains are capable of changing and adapting to a wide variety of circumstances. Blind people use their visual areas of the brain while echolocating, stroke survivors can regain lost motor functions using the unaffected brain circuits, and babies can effortlessly learn two languages simultaneously in a bilingual household."
"Plasticity is based on the idea that not only is the brain capable change, but that our experiences change the structure and function of our nervous system. There are 2 major cell types within the nervous system: Neurons and Neuroglia. Neurons are cells that transmit electrical information."
"Neuroglia are supporting cells of the nervous system. Neurons are the basic units of the brain. Their main function is to send electrical signals over short and long distances in the body, and they are electrically and chemically excitable."
"The function of the neuron is dependent on the structure of the neuron. The typical neuron consists of the dendrites, cell body, axon , and presynaptic terminal. Although neurons do have a variety of adaptations that make them unique from other types of cells in the body, they are still cells."
"Therefore, they contain all of the basic features of a typical mammalian cell. For example, they are made up of an aqueous cytoplasm bounded by a cell membrane. This cell membrane, also called a plasma membrane or lipid membrane, consists of a sheet of several individual molecules called phospholipids, which consist of two hydrophobic  tails and a hydrophilic  end."
"These phospholipids arrange themselves into a bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails touching each other and the hydrophilic sides facing the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, which are both mostly water. Because of the chemical properties of the cell membrane, it is very effective at keeping ions and charged molecules separated, while allowing small molecules like water and oxygen across the cell. Neurons also have all the organelles that you would see in other cell types, like a nucleus and mitochondria."
"The number of neurons in the adult human brain, according to our current best estimate, is close to 86 billion. This number was calculated using a revolutionary technique, the isotropic fractionator or “brain soup”, developed by Brazilian neuroanatomist Suzana Herculano-Houzel. To put this number in context, we have about 37 trillion cells in the whole body, so neurons in the brain make up about 0."
2% of all cells in the body. Below are some unique characteristics that neurons have in common. 1.
"Neurons are electroactive, which means that they are charged cells that can change their charge. 2. Neurons are specialized for rapid communication."
"Many cells are capable of sending and receiving chemical signals across long distances and time scales, but neurons are able to communicate with a combination of electrical and chemical signals in a matter of milliseconds. Additionally, the shape of neurons and the organization of the neurons on a microscopic level make them effective for sending signals in a very specific direction. 3."
"Neurons are “forever” cells. We are constantly replacing non-neuronal cells. For example, the cells in our bones replace themselves frequently at a rate of about 10% each year."
"Our body makes new skin cells to replace the dying skin cells on the surface so that we have a “new” skin every month. The cells along the inside of our stomachs, exposed to very harsh acidic conditions, get replaced about every week. About 100 million new red blood cells are created every minute! On the other hand, the mature nervous system generally does not undergo much neurogenesis: the creation of new neurons."
"The neurons that we have after development are the ones that we will keep until we die and this permanence of neuronal count makes them different from almost every other cell of the body. However, the idea of adult neurogenesis is a topic of debate among neuroscientists since some areas, like the olfactory system and the hippocampus, display new nerve cell production. 4."
"…But, neurons can change. Even though new neurons are not created in most areas of the brain, neurons still have the capability to change in their structure and function. Some of these changes, such as physical changes to the structures of the input sites of the neurons, are believed to last for a lifetime."
"We use the word plasticity to describe the ability for the brain to alter its morphology. This term is derived from the Greek plastikos, meaning “capable of being shaped or molded”—think of plastic surgery, where a person changes their physical appearance. Also, neurons do have the capacity to repair themselves to some extent."
"Neurons of the Peripheral Nervous System may get injured or completely destroyed as a result of trauma to the body. Afterwards, those injured neurons can regrow to connect once again with their original partner. This regrowth seems to depend on a few chemical signals that the body produces, such as nerve growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor."
"However, this process is often very slow, and does not always successfully restore the nervous system to the way it was pre-injury. The main function of neurons is to use changes in electrical properties in order to communicate with connected cells. This communication usually moves in one direction, and we will use this pathway as an outline for discussing the anatomical structures of the neurons."
"Dendrites, shown here in green, are processes that branch out in a tree-like fashion from the cell body. They are the main target for incoming signals received from other cells. The number of inputs a neuron receives depends on the complexity of the dendritic branching."
"Dendrites may also have small protrusions along the branches known as spines. Spines  are the sites of some synaptic contacts. Spines increase the surface area of the dendritic arbor, which may be an important factor in receiving communication."
"We believe that spines are one of the most important sites where the nervous system is able to change. For example, neurons change shape after exposure to various environmental conditions, such as stress or exposure to drugs. Tiny changes to the surface of the neuron at the level of dendritic spines is an example of plasticity."
"Dendritic plasticity is thought to underlie the reason that we can learn new facts or maintain memories about our childhood over long periods of time. Some set of tiny, submicroscopic changes to the morphology of dendritic spines may represent a single complex memory that you form. A neuron does not need spines for receiving information or for plasticity to take place."
"Many cells lack spines but are still capable of permanently changing. The input site may be anywhere along the dendrite, or even at the cell body—the “center” of the neuron. Information that arrives through the many dendrites of a neuron eventually filters into the cell body, or the soma, of the neuron."
"The cell body  contains the nucleus and cellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosomes, and secretory vesicles. The nucleus houses the DNA of the cell, which is the template for all proteins synthesized in the cell. The organelles  in the soma are responsible for cellular mechanisms like protein synthesis, packaging of molecules, and cellular respiration."
"The cell body is responsible for deciding whether to pass a signal onto the next cell. The cell membrane of the soma performs a complex set of “cellular arithmetic” that weighs all of the incoming signals: excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory signals. After all of the calculations have been performed, the membrane decides to send a signal, either a “yes” or “no” output, which travels down the axon."
"The axon is the main output extension of the neuron. The axon  is usually a long, single process that begins at the axon hillock and extends out from the cell body. The axon hillock is located where the cell body transitions into the axon."
Axons can branch in order to communicate with more than one target cell. Several axons can bundle and travel together; these are nerves. Axons can be very long; the longest axon in the human body is part of the sciatic nerve that runs from the posterior end of the spinal cord down the leg to control the muscles of the big toe.
"The axon transmits an electrical signal—called an action potential—from the axon hillock to the presynaptic terminal, where the electrical signal will result in a release of chemical neurotransmitters to communicate with the next cell. The action potential is a very brief change in the electrical potential, which is the difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell. During the action potential, the electrical potential across the membrane moves from a negative value to a positive value and back."
"Many axons are also covered by a myelin sheath, a fatty substance that wraps around portions of the axon and increases action potential speed. There are breaks between the myelin segments called Nodes of Ranvier, and this uncovered region of the membrane regenerates the action potential as it propagates down the axon in a process called saltatory conduction. There is a high concentration of voltage-gated ion channels, which are necessary for the action potential to occur, in the Nodes of Ranvier."
"The length of an axon is variable depending on the location of the neuron and its function. The axon of a sensory neuron in your big toe needs to travel from your foot up to your spinal cord, whereas an interneuron in your spinal cord may only be a few hundred micrometers in length. Axon diameter is also variable and can be used to differentiate different types of neurons."
"The diameter affects the speed at which the action potential will propagate. The larger the diameter, the faster the signal can travel. Additionally, larger diameter axons tend to have thicker myelin."
"Axoplasmic transport refers to the movement of material within the axon. Organelles, vesicles, and proteins can be moved from the cell body to the terminal via anterograde transport or from the terminal to the cell body via retrograde transport. Anterograde transport can be either fast or slow."
Microtubules run the length of the axon and provide the cytoskeleton tracks necessary for the transportation of materials. Proteins aid in axoplasmic transport. Kinesin is a motor protein that uses ATP and is used in anterograde transport of materials.
"Dynein is another motor protein that also uses ATP, but is used in retrograde transport of materials. The synapse is the physical distance that separates two neurons. Electrical synapses physically share cytoplasm."
"An electrical synapse may be less than 5 nanometers apart. Cells connected by electrical synapses share cytoplasm, but have two separate cell membranes. Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to communicate."
"Chemical synapses can vary depending on the nature of the synapse. A chemical synapse is a larger distance, about 15–40 nm across. Adjacent neurons connected by chemical synapses do not share cytoplasm."
"The axon terminates at the presynaptic terminal or terminal bouton. The terminal of the presynaptic cell forms a synapse with another neuron or cell, known as the postsynaptic cell. When the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, the neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synapse."
"The neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic cell. Therefore, neuronal communication requires both an electrical signal  and a chemical signal . Most commonly, presynaptic terminals contact dendrites, but terminals can also communicate with cell bodies or even axons."
Neurons can also synapse on non-neuronal cells such as muscle cells or glands. The terms presynaptic and postsynaptic are in reference to which neuron is releasing neurotransmitters and which is receiving them. Presynaptic cells release neurotransmitters into the synapse and those neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic cell.
"Although these typical structural components can be seen in all neurons, the overall structure can vary drastically depending on the location and function of the neuron. Some neurons, called unipolar, have only one branch from the cell body, and the dendrites and axon terminals project from it. Others, called bipolar, have one axonal branch and one dendritic branch."
"Multipolar neurons can have many processes branching from the cell body. Additionally, each of the projections can take many forms, with different branching characteristics. The common features of cell body, dendrites, and axon, though, are common among all neurons."
"Although most of neuroscience is concerned with understanding the functions of neurons, there are other cells in the nervous system that are just as interesting. These cells are grouped together under the umbrella classification of glia. Historically, when these non-neuronal cells were visualized under the microscope, the histologists and anatomists had no idea about their function."
"They were seen all around the neurons, so the assumption was that these cells were structural elements, a sort of living glue, that held the nervous system together. Today, we know that these glia serve a variety of functions; unfortunately, the misnomer “glia”—derived from the Latin word for “glue”—is still used to describe these non-neuronal components of the nervous system. Astrocytes are named for their characteristic star-shaped morphology."
One of the main functions of astrocytes in the brain is to help maintain the blood-brain barrier. At the end of the extensions of the astrocyte are protrusions called “endfeet”. These endfeet are often wrapped around the endothelial cells that surround the blood vessels.
"The endfeet release important biological compounds that allow the endothelial cells to remain healthy as they function in maintaining the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes are also very closely associated with synapses. Astrocytes also synthesize and produce a variety of trophic factors, which are helper molecular signals that serve several different functions."
"For one, trophic factors signal to neurons that the neuron should continue to live, or that specific synapses should be maintained. They help guide the neurons as they reach out, forming synapses where appropriate. The main function of the oligodendrocytes is to add a layer of myelin around the axons of nearby neurons in the central nervous system."
"A single oligodendrocyte is able to myelinate up to 50 segments of axons. As cells that produce myelin, they are responsible for increasing the conduction speed of nearby neurons as they send signals. Oligodendrocytes only exist in the central nervous system."
"Schwann cells can only be found in the peripheral nervous system. The main action of Schwann cells is to provide a section of myelin sheath for peripheral nervous system neurons, and in this way, they function similarly to the oligodendrocytes. Schwann cells produce only a single section of myelin, compared to oligodendrocytes, which myelinate multiple sections."
"Schwann cells also function in the regeneration of injured axons. When nerves in the peripheral nervous system are damaged after trauma, Schwann cells rapidly mobilize to the site of injury. Microglia are a bit different from the other glial cell populations."
"For one, microglia are more immune cells rather than neural. They act as cellular scavengers that travel throughout the brain and spinal cord. It is estimated that microglia make up 10-15% of all cells in the brain."
"As immune cells, microglia identify and destroy clumps of proteins, dead/dying cells, or foreign pathogens that enter into the brain. After an injury to the central nervous system, like a traumatic blow to the head, microglia rapidly react to the area of the insult. Along the inside of the ventricles are a lining of glia called ependymal cells."
These ependymal cells are columnar with small fingerlike extensions called cilia that extend into the ventricles and into the central canal that runs down the inside of the spinal cord. The cilia have motor properties that allow for them to rhythmically beat to create a current in the surrounding fluid. Ependymal cells produce cerebral spinal fluid .
"In total, the body can make about half a liter of CSF each day  The ependymal cells are part of a structure called the choroid plexus, the network of blood vessels and cells that form a boundary between the blood and the CSF. For the majority of human history, the only way we were able to study the structure of the brain was with crude, butcher-like methods. Wait for a person to die, saw a giant hole in the top of the skull, take the brain out, and slice it into pieces to see if there was some correlation between the way the brain looks and the way they died."
"With these methods, only major changes in gross anatomy could be observed, such as those resulting from severe birth defects or trauma. Brain analysis methods were enhanced by the scientific adoption of light microscopy. Naturalists in the mid 1600s such as Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Jan Swammerdam, and Robert Hooke began looking at biological substances up close, and the brain proved to be a complex and interesting sample of tissue."
Staining is an imaging method that is often used in conjunction with microscopy. Thin slices of brain tissue are exposed to various chemical processes. The chemicals that are used for staining have different affinities for parts of cells.
"For staining to work, the tissue needs to be subjected to a series of chemical processes. First, the tissue needs to be fixed. Fixation is a chemical process that is accomplished by exposing the tissue to a chemical like paraformaldehyde."
"The most effective way to expose every part of the body to fixative is to “hijack” the endogenous circulatory system by flushing fixative through the arteries, a process called perfusion. Chemically, fixatives cause adjacent proteins to become covalently bonded , a process which causes the proteins to become unchangeable; they become “fixed” in time. These fixatives are very harsh chemicals, and usually kill microorganisms and inactivate the endogenous enzymes that normally degrade biological tissue."
"After fixation, devices such as a microtome or cryostat are used to slice the brain into sections as thin as 10 microns. Stains do not always reliably pass all the way through thick sections of tissue, such as an intact brain. With thin slices, chemical stains are able to permeate through the depth of the tissue."
"Next, stains are used to color the cells of the nervous system. This process is used because it is good for identifying the location of specific proteins at a subcellular level. A stain is needed to distinguish individual cells in nervous tissue."
"Nissl stain  was discovered by Franz Nissl. It stains nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA. Thus, the stain is only localized to neuronal cell bodies, where RNA and DNA are found."
This staining method is useful for studying neuronal arrangement and how densely neurons are packed in specific brain structures. A major advancement in the study of neuronal morphology came about in the late 1800s. The Italian anatomist and biologist Camillo Golgi identified a shortcoming with the cellular analysis techniques of the time: structures in the central nervous sytem were impossible to distinguish from one another.
"The cells in the brain were so densely packed together, that it became difficult to identify which cellular material belonged to which cell. Golgi came up with a new technique using a silver compound that caused the silver to precipitate inside the cell membranes. However, not every cell took up the silver."
"Instead, only a small fraction of neurons, maybe 1% or even less, were completely stained in black, which stood out remarkably well against the light yellow background of the surrounding tissue. This reaction, initially called the “black reaction”, is now known as a “Golgi stain”. Because of the great contrast between cell and background, every single part of the neuron was completely filled, allowing Golgi to do drawings of the morphology of this nervous tissue."
"Based on his staining results, Golgi supported the idea that the parts of the nervous system are all one very large, physically connected network. This idea was known as the Reticular Theory. About 10 years later, the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal repeated some of Golgi’s staining experiments with other sections of nervous tissue."
"Looking at similar darkly-filled neurons, Cajal arrived at a different conclusion: the nervous system is not a giant net, but rather a series of individual units that are separated from one another physically. This idea came to be known as the Neuron Doctrine. Both Golgi and Cajal were awarded the shared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their accomplishments in helping to understand “the structure of the nervous system”."
"Even though Cajal’s Neuron Doctrine was adopted widely by scientists, the elucidation of this organization would not have been made possible without Golgi’s development of the silver stain. The sharing of this prestigious award was ironic because of the many disagreements between the two scientists. Cajal’s Neuron Doctrine was eventually given more support with the aid of modern techniques, like electron microscopy, that are capable of physically seeing the distance between two neurons."
"The Neuron Doctrine represents our current understanding of how the nervous system is organized. Ion flow into and out of the neuron is a critical component of neuron function. Ions move in predictable ways, and the control of ion movement affects the cell at rest and while sending and receiving information from other neurons."
"The cell membrane that separates the inside of the cell from the outside is a very effective boundary. It is described as being selectively permeable, which means that some molecules are able to travel across the membrane easily, other molecules have an intermediate ability to cross, and other molecules are completely incapable of passing. Generally, gases and molecules of water are able to pass through the cell membrane easily."
"Large molecules like glucose, and charged molecules like ions or amino acids, are unable to pass across the membrane. The neuronal membrane is composed of lipid molecules that form two layers. The hydrophilic heads of the molecules align on the outside of the membrane, interacting with the intra- and extracellular solution of the cell, whereas the hydrophobic tails are arranged in the middle, forming a barrier to water and water-soluble molecules like ions."
"This barrier is critical to neuron function. Most cells of the body, including neurons, have specialized transmembrane proteins embedded in the cell membrane. These transmembrane proteins are huge protein complexes that span the entirety of the membrane, with an outer side and an inner side."
"In the middle of the protein is a pore, which is essentially a “tunnel” that allows molecules and ions to pass across the cell membrane. These proteins are called ion channels. These channels are passive since they do not use any cellular energy to move ions."
"Rather, they simply provide easy passage for ions. It may be useful to think of an ion channel as a “cellular door”. Ion channels are embedded throughout the neuronal membrane."
Channels can be opened and closed in a number of different ways. We can categorize ion channels into four major classes based on their opening and closing conditions. Leak channels are persistently open.
You can think of these leak channels as revolving doors that are never locked. Neurons usually have several leak channels. Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to a change in membrane potential.
"Ligand-gated ion channels open in response to chemical  binding, such as neurotransmitters. The fourth class of ion channels is a catch-all category that includes a wide variety of channels that are used by the sensory systems. They open and close in response to unique stimuli depending on what they are able to sense."
"For example, some open and close depending when they are moved physically, such as a distortion or stretch . We have these in the hair cells of our ears, in our skin, and in our muscles. Photoreceptors in our eyes have ion channels that close in response to being hit by photons of light, and this activity is necessary for us to be able to see in both brightly and dimly lit environments."
"One important feature of ion channels is their ability to distinguish ions based on their chemical properties. For example, some channels are selective for Na+, while preventing the passage of all other ions. Each ion channel has special molecular characteristics that allow certain types of ions to pass through the pore while excluding other ions."
"Channels can be specific to one ion or allow the flow of multiple ions. Ion channels control ion movement across the cell membrane because the phospholipid bilayer is impermeable to the charged atoms. When the channels are closed, no ions can move into or out of the cell."
"When ion channels open, however, then ions can move across the cell membrane. Ions move in predictable ways. Concentration  and electrical gradients drive ion movement."
"The chemical gradient refers to the natural process by which a high concentration of a substance, given enough time, will eventually diffuse to a lower concentration and settle evenly over the space. Ions will diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. Diffusion is a passive process, meaning it does not require energy."
"As long as a pathway exists , the ions will move down the concentration gradient. In addition to concentration gradients, electrical gradients can also drive ion movement. The electrical gradient refers to the electrical forces acting on charged molecules, “pulling” opposite charges together while also “pushing” like charges away from one another—just like the polarity of magnets."
"Ions are attracted to, and will move toward, regions of opposite charge. Positive ions will move toward regions of negative charge, and vice versa. For discussion of ion movement in this text, the combination of these two gradients will be referred to as the electrochemical gradient."
"Sometimes the concentration and electrical gradients driving ion movement can be in the same direction; sometimes the direction is opposite. The electrochemical gradient is the summation of the two individual gradients and provides a single direction for ion movement. When the concentration and electrical gradients for a given ion balance—meaning they are equal in strength, but in different directions—that ion will be at equilibrium."
"Ions still move across the membrane through open channels when at equilibrium, but there is no net movement in either direction, meaning there is an equal number of ions moving into the cell as there are moving out of the cell. Sodium, potassium, and chloride ions are found in different concentrations across the neuron cell membrane. The location of these ions across the cell membrane and their concentration gradients are important for the function of the neuron."
Sodium  ions are more concentrated in the extracellular fluid and less concentrated within the intracellular fluid. Whereas potassium  ions are more concentrated within the intracellular fluid and less concentrated in the extracellular fluid. The membrane potential is the difference in electrical charge between the inside and the outside of the neuron.
This is measured using two electrodes. A reference electrode  is placed in the extracellular solution. The recording electrode is inserted into the cell body of the neuron.
"There is more than one way to describe a change in membrane potential. The membrane potential is measured as the difference in charge between the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell. If the membrane potential moves toward zero, that is a depolarization, because the membrane is becoming less polarized—meaning there is a smaller difference between the charge on the inside of the cell compared to the outside."
"This is also referred to as a decrease in membrane potential. This means that when a neuron’s membrane potential moves from rest, which is typically around -65 mV, toward 0 mV and becomes more positive, this is a decrease in membrane potential. Since the membrane potential is the difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of the cell, that difference decreases as the cell’s membrane potential moves toward 0 mV."
"If the membrane potential moves away from zero, or gets more negative than it was at rest, that is a hyperpolarization because the membrane is becoming more polarized. This is also referred to as an increase in membrane potential. At rest, ions are not equally distributed across the membrane."
"This distribution of ions and other charged molecules leads to the inside of the cell having a more negative charge compared to the outside of the cell. A closer look shows that sodium, calcium, and chloride are concentrated outside of the cell membrane in the extracellular solution, whereas potassium and negatively-charged molecules like amino acids and proteins are concentrated inside in the intracellular solution. These concentration differences lead to varying degrees of electrochemical gradients in different directions depending on the ion in question."
"For example, the electrochemical gradients will drive potassium out of the cell, but will drive sodium into the cell. The neuron’s membrane potential at which the electrical and concentration gradients for a given ion balance out is called the ion’s equilibrium potential. Let’s look at sodium in more detail: When sodium channels open, the neuron’s membrane becomes permeable to sodium, and sodium will begin to flow across the membrane."
"The direction is dependent upon the electrochemical gradients. The concentration of sodium in the extracellular solution is about 10 times higher than the intracellular solution, so there is a concentration gradient driving sodium into the cell. Additionally, at rest, the inside of the neuron is more negative than the outside, so there is also an electrical gradient driving sodium into the cell."
"As sodium moves into the cell, though, these gradients change in driving strength. As the neuron’s membrane potential become positive, the electrical gradient no longer works to drive sodium into the cell. Eventually, the concentration gradient driving sodium into the neuron and the electrical gradient driving sodium out of the neuron balance with equal and opposite strengths, and sodium is at equilibrium."
"The membrane potential of the neuron at which equilibrium occurs is called the equilibrium potential of an ion, which is approximately +60 mV for sodium. It is possible to predict which way an ion will move by comparing the ion’s equilibrium potential to the neuron’s membrane potential. Let’s assume we have a cell with a resting membrane potential of -70 mV."
"Sodium’s equilibrium potential is +60 mV. Therefore, to reach equilibrium, sodium will need to enter the cell, bringing in positive charge. On the other hand, chloride’s equilibrium potential is -65 mV."
"Since chloride is a negative ion, it will need to leave the cell in order to make the cell’s membrane potential more positive to move from -70 mV to -65 mV. As covered in the previous chapter, at rest there is an uneven distribution of ions on either side of the membrane. The inside of the neuron is more negatively charged than the outside."
"The resting membrane potential of a typical neuron is around -65mV to -70mV, though it can vary. How the ions are distributed across the membrane plays an important role in the generation of the resting membrane potential. When the cell is at rest, some non-gated, or leak, ion channels are actually open."
"Significantly more potassium channels are open than sodium channels, and this makes the membrane at rest more permeable to potassium than sodium. Since the membrane is permeable to potassium at rest due to the open non-gated channels, potassium will be able to flow across the membrane. The electrochemical gradients at work will cause potassium to flow out of the cell in order to move the cell’s membrane potential toward potassium’s equilibrium potential of -80 mV."
"The resting membrane potential of a neuron is typically around -65mV to -70mV . You might ask, though, if the cell has these open non-gated ion channels, and ions are moving at rest, won’t the cell eventually reach potassium’s equilibrium potential if the membrane is only permeable to potassium? If the open non-gated potassium channels were the only structural ion flow element present in the cell membrane, the membrane potential would eventually reach potassium’s equilibrium potential."
"However, the membrane has other open non-gated ion channels as well. Although, there are fewer of these channels compared to the potassium channels. The permeability of chloride is about half that of potassium and the permeability of sodium is about 25 to 40 times less than that of potassium."
This leads to enough chloride and sodium ion movement to keep the neuron at a resting membrane potential that is slightly more positive than potassium’s equilibrium potential. There are negatively charged anions trapped within the cell that contribute to the negative intracellular charge when compared to the extracellular charge. It is critical the ion gradients that exist across the membrane be maintained for proper neuronal function.
"As ions move across the membrane, both at rest and when the neuron is active, the concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell would change. This would lead to changes in the electrochemical gradients that are driving ion movement. What, then, maintains the concentration and electrical gradients critical for the ion flow that allows the neuron to function properly?"
"The sodium-potassium pump is the key. The pump uses energy in the form of ATP to move three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in. This moves the ions against their electrochemical gradients, which is why it requires energy."
The pump functions to keep the ionic concentrations at proper levels inside and outside the cell. The pump is removing three positively charged ions from inside the cell and adding two positively charged ions. This leaves the inside of the cell always more negative than the outside of the cell.
"Importantly, membrane potential is affected by all of the ions that exist around the membrane. It is possible to calculate the membrane potential of a cell if the concentrations and relative permeabilities of the ions are known. Recall from the last chapter, the Nernst equation is used to calculate one ion’s equilibrium potential."
"Knowing the equilibrium potential can help you predict which way one ion will move, and it also calculates the membrane potential value that the cell would reach if the membrane were only permeable to one ion. However, at rest, the membrane is permeable to potassium, chloride, and sodium. To calculate the membrane potential, the Goldman equation is needed."
"Clearly, potassium levels must be tightly regulated due to the permeability of potassium for the neuronal membrane. Due to the importance of maintaining appropriate potassium levels, the brain has a specialized structure called the Blood Brain Barrier that helps to maintain proper extracellular potassium in the brain by limiting the amount of potassium that can move from capillaries into the brain. Without the blood brain barrier, eating foods that are high in potassium, like a banana, could completely halt the function of your brain!  Typically, capillaries are very leaky vessels, allowing a variety of different nutrients and waste products to pass between the capillaries and the body tissues."
"The capillaries in the brain, however, are surrounded by astrocytes . The addition of the astrocytes makes it more difficult for substances to pass between the blood and the brain tissue. In addition to blocking the movement of potassium from the blood to the brain tissue, astrocytes also have potassium pumps in the astrocyte membranes that actively pump potassium out of the extracellular fluid and into the astrocytes to help regulate extracellular potassium levels."
"This is called potassium buffering. The membrane potential will always fall into one of the following categories:  Resting membrane potential Graded Potentials  Action potentials When the neuron is at rest, there is a baseline level of ion flow through leak channels. However, the ability of neurons to function properly and communicate with other neurons through action potentials relies on ion flow through channels other than the non-gated leak channels."
We will cover how these channels open in a later lesson. This chapter will examine ion flow through these channels after a stimulus and how the membrane potential changes in response. Postsynaptic potentials  are changes in membrane potential that move the cell away from its resting state.
"For our purposes, postsynaptic potentials are measured in the dendrites and cell bodies. Ion channels that are opened by a stimulus allow brief ion flow across the membrane. A stimulus can range from neurotransmitters released by a presynaptic neuron, changes in the extracellular environment like exposure to heat or cold, interactions with sensory stimuli like light or odors, or other chemical or mechanical events."
The change in membrane potential in response to the stimulus will depend on which ion channels are opened by the stimulus. An Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential  occurs when sodium channels open in response to a stimulus. The electrochemical gradient drives sodium to rush into the cell.
"When sodium brings its positive charge into the cell, the cell’s membrane potential becomes more positive, or depolarizes. This change is called a depolarization because the cell’s membrane potential is moving toward 0 mV, and the membrane is becoming less polarized. At 0 mV, there is no potential or polarization across the membrane, so moving toward 0 would be a decrease in potential."
"This depolarization increases the likelihood a neuron will be able to fire an action potential, which makes this ion flow excitatory. Therefore, an EPSP is an excitatory change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron. A postsynaptic potential is typically brief, with ion channels closing quickly after the stimulus occurs."
"If there is not another stimulus, the cell will return to the resting membrane potential. An inhibitory postsynaptic potential, or IPSP, on the other hand, is caused by the opening of chloride channels. The equilibrium potential of chloride is -65 mV, so if the neuron is at rest at -60 mV, the electrochemical gradients drive chloride to flow into the cell when chloride channels open."
"Chloride brings its negative charge into the cell, causing the cell’s membrane potential to become more negative, or hyperpolarize. This change is called a hyperpolarization because the cell’s membrane potential is moving away from 0 mV, and the membrane is becoming more polarized. An IPSP decreases the likelihood a neuron will be able to fire an action potential, which make this ion flow inhibitory."
"Therefore, an IPSP is an inhibitory change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron. An IPSP can also be caused by the opening of potassium channels. The equilibrium potential of potassium is -80 mV, so if the neuron is at rest at -60mV, the electrochemical gradients drive potassium out of the cell when potassium channels open."
"As positively charged potassium ions leave the cell, this causes the cell’s membrane potential to hyperpolarize. This demonstrates the importance of the equilibrium potential in driving ion movement. Like an EPSP, an IPSP is also typically brief, and the membrane potential will return to rest if no additional stimulation occurs."
"In the previous example, the resting membrane potential of that cell was -60 mV, so chloride moved into the cell. If the resting membrane potential was instead equal to chloride’s equilibrium potential of -65 mV, then chloride would be at equilibrium and move into and out of the cell; there would be no net movement of the ion. Even though this would lead to no change in membrane potential, the opening of chloride channels continues to be inhibitory."
"Increased chloride conductance would make it more difficult for the cell to depolarize and to fire an action potential. If the resting membrane potential of the cell was more negative than chloride’s equilibrium potential—for example, at -70 mV—then chloride would leave the cell in order to move the membrane potential toward -65 mV. This would result in a depolarization of the membrane potential."
"However, the overall effect is still inhibitory because once the cell reaches -65 mV, the driving forces acting on chloride would try to keep the cell at that membrane potential, making it more difficult for the cell to depolarize further and fire an action potential. A good rule of thumb is to remember that opening of sodium channels is excitatory whereas opening of potassium or chloride channels is typically inhibitory. If an excitatory stimulus is followed by additional excitatory stimuli, the sodium channels will either remain open or additional sodium channels will open."
"The increased sodium conductance will cause the EPSPs to summate, depolarizing the cell further than one EPSP alone. Each neuron has a threshold membrane potential at which the cell will fire an action potential. The summation of EPSPs causes the neuron to reach that threshold."
Summation can occur in two ways. Temporal summation occurs when one presynaptic input stimulates a postsynaptic neuron multiple times in a row. Spatial summation occurs when multiple presynaptic inputs each stimulate the postsynaptic neuron at the same time.
"Both types of summation result in a depolarization of a higher magnitude than when only a single excitatory input occurs. In addition to the summation of excitatory inputs, EPSPs can also summate with inhibitory inputs. The addition of an inhibitory stimulus will result in either a weaker depolarization compared to a single excitatory stimulus, or possibly no depolarization at all depending on the strength of the inhibitory input."
"In the case of combined inhibitory and excitatory stimuli, both chloride and sodium channels will open. As sodium enters the cell, trying to move the membrane potential to +60 mV  chloride will also enter, trying to keep the cell near -65 mV . As covered in previous chapters, the action potential is a very brief change in the electrical potential, which is the difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell."
"During the action potential, the electrical potential across the membrane moves from a negative resting value to a positive value and back. The propagation of the action potential from the axon hillock down the axon and to the presynaptic terminal results in the release of chemical neurotransmitters that communicate with a postsynaptic neuron. The change in membrane potential during the action potential is a function of ion channels in the membrane."
"In the previous lessons, we have learned about the principles of ion movement and have discussed non-gated  channels at rest, as well as ion channels involved in the generation of postsynaptic potentials. In this chapter, we will examine a different type of ion channel: voltage-gated ion channels. For our purposes, these channels are located primarily at the axon hillock, along the axon, and at the terminal."
They are necessary for the propagation of the action potential. Voltage-gated channels allow ions to cross the membrane using the same ion movement principles covered in previous lessons. The main difference between voltage-gated channels and leak channels are how they are opened or “gated”.
"Voltage-gated channels open when the cell’s membrane potential reaches a specific value, called threshold. The neuron reaches threshold after enough EPSPs summate together. The action potential begins when the cell’s membrane potential reaches threshold."
"Once initiated in a healthy, unmanipulated neuron, the action potential has a consistent structure and is an all-or-nothing event. It will run through all the phases to completion. The rising phase is a rapid depolarization followed by the overshoot, when the membrane potential becomes positive."
"The falling phase is a rapid repolarization followed by the undershoot, when the membrane potential hyperpolarizes past rest. Finally, the membrane potential will return to the resting membrane potential. The rising phase is caused by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels."
"These ion channels are activated once the cell’s membrane potential reaches threshold, opening immediately. The electrochemical gradients drive sodium into the cell causing the depolarization. The falling phase of the action potential is caused by the inactivation of the sodium channels and the opening of the potassium channels."
"After approximately 1 msec, the sodium channels inactivate. The channel becomes blocked, preventing ion flow. At the same time, the voltage-gated potassium channels open."
"This allows potassium to rush out of the cell because of the electrochemical gradients, taking its positive charge out of the cell and repolarizing the membrane potential, which returns the cell’s membrane potential back near rest. Like the voltage-gated sodium channels, the voltage trigger for the potassium channel is when the cell’s membrane potential reaches threshold. The difference is that the sodium channels open immediately, whereas the potassium channels open after a delay."
"As the membrane potential returns to resting level, the sodium channels will de-inactivate, returning to the closed position, ready to be opened again by another voltage change. The potassium channels will also close, but they remain open long enough to cause a hyperpolarizing undershoot as potassium continues to move toward its equilibrium potential of -80 mV. Once the voltage-gated channels close, the sodium-potassium pumps will reestablish the proper ionic concentrations needed for the electrochemical gradients."
"This action, along with open leak channels, will return the cell to its resting membrane potential. Each neuron does have a maximum firing rate. And even if the stimulus continues to increase in strength, the neuron cannot fire at a higher frequency."
"The maximum firing rate of a cell is determined by the status of the ion channels in the neuronal membrane during the different phases of the action potential. During the absolute refractory period, a second action potential cannot be fired under any circumstances, regardless of the strength of the stimulus. The voltage-gated sodium channels are either open  or inactivated ."
"When the cell repolarizes and the voltage-gated sodium channels de-inactivate and return to a closed state, the cell is again able to fire another action potential. However, during the end of the falling phase and the during the undershoot, voltage-gated potassium channels are still open. During the undershoot, while the neuron is hyperpolarized, a larger-than-normal stimulus is needed to make the cell reach threshold again."
"This segment of the action potential is called the relative refractory period. Action potentials can be fired, but a stronger stimulus is needed than when the cell is at rest. For a given cell, all action potentials have the same characteristics; they depolarize to the same membrane potential value and take the same amount of time."
"However, different neurons may exhibit different action potential characteristics. Likewise, if a neuron has a change in its environment, like altered extracellular ion concentrations, the shape of the action potential would change due to a change in the electrochemical gradients. For example, if the external concentration of sodium is decreased, the equilibrium potential of sodium  will change, which will result in a slower rate of rise and a lower amplitude of the action potential."
"The strength of a stimulus needs to be encoded by the neurons. We need to be able to perceive the difference, for example, between a dim light and a bright one. The frequency, or rate, of action potential firing informs the nervous system of stimulus strength."
"Since the height of the action potential is always the same for a given neuron, the strength of the stimulus is determined by the frequency of action potential firing. A weak stimulus would cause fewer action potentials to be fired than a strong stimulus. The action potential moves down the axon due to the influx of sodium depolarizing nearby axon segments to threshold."
"Action potentials only move in one direction, from the cell body to the presynaptic terminal. The refractory period keeps the action potential from moving backward down the axon. As the action potential moves from one Node of Ranvier to the next, the inactivated sodium channels in the previous axon segment prevent the membrane from depolarizing again."
"Therefore, the action potential can only move forward toward axon segments with closed sodium channels ready for rising phase depolarization. The presence of myelin leads to a significant increase in action potential conduction speed compared to an unmyelinated axon. For a myelinated axon, the action potential “jumps” between Nodes of Ranvier in a process called saltatory conduction."
"The nodes have a high density of voltage-gated channels, and the action potential is able to skip the axon segments covered by the myelin. In an unmyelinated axon, the action potential moves in a continuous wave. In additional to the saltatory conduction process, the presence of myelin also insulates the axon, preventing charge loss across the membrane, which also increases speed of the action potential."
"The diameter of the axon also affects speed. The larger the diameter of the axon, the faster the propagation of the action potential down the axon. A larger axon leads to less resistance against the flow of ions, so the sodium ions are able to move more quickly to cause the regeneration of the action potential in the next axon segment."
"In the previous chapter, we covered ion flow and membrane potential changes that occur in the neuron during the action potential. We have this level of understanding about how ions move during the action potential because of a special technique called a voltage clamp experiment that was used in the 1950s. The voltage clamp method allows researchers to study voltage-gated ion channels by controlling the membrane potential of a neuron."
"To conduct a voltage clamp experiment, a portion of the axon, which would include the cell membrane and all the voltage-gated ion channels located there, is removed from a neuron and placed into a solution that mimics that of physiological extracellular solution. The ion concentrations across the membrane, as well as the electrochemical gradients, would remain the same. The initial step in the voltage clamp method is to measure the membrane potential of the axon."
A recording electrode is placed into the axon and a reference electrode  is placed into the extracellular solution. The voltage difference between these two electrodes is the membrane potential of the axon. The researchers running the experiment can set a desired membrane potential for the cell.
"The equipment then compares the desired membrane potential with the measured membrane potential from the electrodes. If these values differ, current is injected into the cell to change the measured membrane potential and make it equal to the desired potential. The equipment continues this cycle for the length of the experiment."
"It constantly measures and compares the actual membrane potential with the desired potential, and then uses current to correct any changes, “clamping” the potential at one value. The important aspect of the depolarization seen in the example is that it is above threshold. Moving the membrane potential above threshold will activate the voltage-gated ion channels."
"Sodium channels will open immediately, and sodium will begin rushing into the cell. This influx of positive ions would normally cause the membrane potential to depolarize, but the voltage clamp equipment will measure the ion flow and inject a current of equal strength and opposite charge into the axon to maintain the membrane potential at 0 mV. This happens almost instantly and is a constant process, so, as the ion flow changes, so does the injected current."
"Since the ion channels function as expected during the voltage clamp experiment, the voltage-gated sodium channels will inactivate and the delayed voltage-gated potassium channels will open. This is because, like the sodium channels, they are also activated when the membrane potential reaches threshold. This causes the ion flow to change from inward to outward."
"Normally, potassium efflux would cause a repolarization of the membrane potential, but the voltage clamp equipment will again inject a current that is equal in strength and opposite in charge to the potassium flow to keep the membrane potential steady at 0 mV. Researchers can determine how much current is moving through the voltage-gated ion channels by observing how much current the equipment must inject into the cell to keep the membrane potential steady. If the equipment has to inject negative current in for 2 milliseconds, then the researchers know that positive ions were flowing in for 2 milliseconds."
"The voltage-clamp setup allowed researchers in the 1950s to learn about how the voltage-gated ion channels were functioning during an action potential. For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to communicate with each other and they do this through structures called synapses. At the synapse, the terminal of a presynaptic cell comes into close contact with the cell membrane of a postsynaptic neuron."
There are two types of synapses: electrical and chemical. Electrical synapses are a direct connection between two neurons. Imagine two neurons that are connected by an electrical synapse.
"First of all, both of them are complete cells on their own. Each one contains a complete plasma membrane surrounding the neuron, a nucleus, and all the individual organelles needed to carry out that cell’s basic life processes. Cell membrane proteins called connexons form gap junctions between the neurons."
"The gap junctions form pores that allow ions to flow between neurons, so, as an action potential propagates in the presynaptic neuron, the influx of sodium can move directly into the postsynaptic neuron and depolarize the cell. The response in the postsynaptic cell is almost immediate, with little-to-no delay between signaling in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Since the gap junctions allow diffusion of ions without any obstruction, the signal can flow bidirectionally through an electrical synapse."
"The electrochemical gradients will drive direction of ion flow. This means that a signal does not always move sequentially from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. Rather, ions and signaling molecules are free to move through the connexons in either direction."
"Also, each cell within an electrically-coupled network can receive inputs at any of the cells, making it able to detect several signals at once—the same way a huge satellite dish can detect more signals than a small dish. Electrical synapses likely evolved because of evolutionary pressures that selected for speed. These synapses can pass signals as fast as electrical charges can move through an electrolyte-rich fluid like cytoplasm; almost instantaneous."
"Another advantage of electrical synapses is that they can form a large network of interconnected neurons with synchronized activity. For example, neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus are connected by electrical synapses. When the “go” signal arrives, all the cells depolarize at once, which can result in the massive release of hormones into the bloodstream."
"A network can also cause sudden, powerful inhibition. Like an angry mob of people chanting, a network of electrical synapses connecting inhibitory interneurons allows the network to send an immediate “shutdown” signal under specific circumstances. Electrical synapses share the cytoplasm between the two connected cells, so ions, ATP, and larger signaling molecules and proteins are able to move between the two cells."
"These signaling molecules play an important role in cellular mechanisms, which we will see in a later chapter. At a chemical synapse, a signaling molecule is released by the presynaptic cell to influence the postsynaptic cell by binding to postsynaptic receptors. Since chemical synapses do not rely on a direct physical protein “tunnel” to connect the two neurons, the distance between the two cells can be much larger."
"On average, a chemical synapse is a distance of about 20-40 nanometers, roughly a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. A chemical synapse can pass a variety of signals, depending on the neurotransmitter and the receptor. For example, some signals are directly excitatory and allow positively charged cations to enter the neuron causing depolarization."
"Other signals are hyperpolarizing, and therefore inhibitory. And yet other signals are much more complex, inducing changes in protein expression that can modify cellular excitability over the course of minutes or hours. At a chemical synapse, the depolarization of an action potential reaching the presynaptic terminal causes release of neurotransmitters."
"These neurotransmitters are synthesized and stored in neurons. After being released, these neurotransmitters diffuse randomly across the synapse, where they are able to affect nearby neurons once the chemical binds to its corresponding receptor located in the cell membrane of the postsynaptic neuron. The structure and function of chemical synapses make them slower than electrical synapses and permit signaling in only one direction."
"Because of the complexity of the signals that chemical synapses can convey, evolutionary development through time has allowed for a tremendous variety of responses. Chemical synapses allow for fine-tuning of neural networks, giving these nervous systems a larger range of possibilities. The nervous systems of “higher” organisms like humans tend to have several chemical synapses since these signals are likely necessary for complex behaviors and cognition."
"As we discuss synaptic transmission, we will focus mainly on axodendritic synapses, in which the presynaptic terminal  synapses on the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell. But synapses can also be located between the terminal and the cell body of the postsynaptic cell, called axosomatic, or even between the terminal and the axon of the postsynaptic cell, called axoaxonic. As we have covered, when an action potential propagates down the axon to the presynaptic terminal, the electrical signal will result in a release of chemical neurotransmitters that will communicate with the postsynaptic cell."
"At a chemical synapse, the process of neurotransmitter release is very tightly regulated. If there were no mechanisms to control the release of chemicals at the synapse, nerve cells would deplete their entire stock of neurotransmitter. Regulation of release depends on several proteins that are important parts of the process."
"These proteins are often embedded within cell membranes of the vesicles or the neuronal membrane. There are a series of steps that take place during chemical synaptic transmission. First, an action potential propagates down the axon until it arrives at the axon terminal, depolarizing the membrane of the presynaptic terminal."
"When the action potential reaches the terminal, there is an influx of sodium ions. This inward positive current causes a depolarization of the terminal, activating voltage-gated calcium channels that are embedded in the cell membrane of the axon terminals. Due to the electrochemical gradient of calcium, when the voltage-gated calcium channels are opened, calcium will rush into the cell."
"The concentration of intracellular calcium, generally in the range of 100 nM, is much lower than the concentration outside the cell, therefore there is a strong electrochemical gradient that moves calcium into the terminal. As it turns out, an elevation of Ca2+ in the intracellular space is the “go ahead” signal that causes neurotransmitter release. The voltage-gated calcium channels are concentrated in the presynaptic terminal at active zones, the regions of the membrane where small molecule neurotransmitters are released."
"At active zones, some synaptic vesicles are docked and are ready for immediate release upon arrival of the action potential. Other neurotransmitter-filled vesicles remain in a reserve pool outside of the active zone. Vesicles filled with neuropeptides do not dock at active zones."
"They are located outside of the active zone, further away from the membrane and the high density of voltage-gated calcium channels. They are, therefore, slower to release than the small molecule transmitters. Synaptic vesicles can be found in one of three places at the axon terminal."
"Readily releasable pool. These vesicles are located close to the cell membrane at the axon terminal. In fact, many of them are already “docked”, meaning that their coat proteins are already interacting closely with the proteins on the inside of the cell membrane."
"When the depolarizing charge of an action potential reaches the terminal, these vesicles at the readily releasable pool are the first ones that fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents. Recycling pool. These vesicles are the ones that have been depleted due to release."
"They are currently in the process of being refilled or reloaded with neurotransmitter. They are farther from the cell membrane, and the protein machinery is not primed for release, so it requires a more intense stimulation to release the contents of these vesicles. Reserve pool."
"These vesicles are the farthest from the surface of the cell membrane, and most vesicles are held in this reserve pool. For these neurotransmitters to be released, very intense stimulation is required. Docking of synaptic vesicles packaged with small molecule neurotransmitters occurs through the interaction of three membrane-bound proteins called SNARE proteins."
"Synaptobrevin is called a v-SNARE because it is located on the Vesicular membrane. Syntaxin and SNAP-25 are called t-SNARES because they are located on the terminal membrane, which is the Target membrane. The interaction of these three proteins leads to vesicle docking at the active zone."
The influx of calcium through the voltage-gated calcium channels initiates the exocytosis process that leads to neurotransmitter release. Calcium enters the cell and interacts with a vesicle-bound protein called synaptotagmin. Synaptotagmin is a calcium sensor that detects elevated levels of calcium in the axon terminal.
"In the presences of calcium, the v-SNAREs and the t-SNAREs interact with one another, forming a molecular structure called a SNARE complex. The SNARE complex looks a lot like two twist ties that are wound tightly together. As they twist tighter together, it causes the vesicle membrane to approach the inside of the cell membrane, which results in vesicular fusion."
"The last step of neurotransmitter release is the fusing of the cell membrane. In order to release their chemical contents into the synapse, vesicles need to fuse with the cell membrane. As the vesicular membrane merges with the interior of the neuronal membrane, the membranes fuse and the contents of the vesicle become exposed to the extracellular space."
"The neurotransmitters then float across the aqueous synapse, giving them the opportunity to interact with postsynaptic receptors. After exocytosis of the transmitter molecules, neurotransmitters traverse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Receptors fall into two main categories: ionotropic receptors  and metabotropic receptors ."
These two types of receptors will be covered in upcoming chapters. Recall the process of summation from Chapter 8. The postsynaptic potentials generated from neurotransmitter binding summate at the axon hillock.
"If the membrane potential is over threshold potential for the cell, then a new action potential will be generated in the postsynaptic cell. Postsynaptic potentials  can occur following different types of stimulation. When neurotransmitters bind to receptors on postsynaptic cells, they cause the receptor proteins to undergo a conformational change, and open ligand-gated ion channels that produce depolarization or hyperpolarization."
It is important that neurotransmitter signaling be tightly regulated. This means that there needs to be ways to terminate chemical signaling. Inactivation can be accomplished in three different ways.
"After being released, neurotransmitters can be altered into inactive substances. Neurotransmitters can go through the reuptake process, where they are recycled by being transported back into the presynaptic cell and repackaged into synaptic vesicles. Some neurotransmitters simply float away from the synapse due to the aqueous environment surrounding neurons."
"Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at the synapse. In this chapter, we will introduce basic information about neurotransmitters and how they are identified. Next, an overview of neurotransmitter receptors will be provided."
Receptors are proteins located on the postsynaptic cell that are capable of sending a signal to change the function or activity of the postsynaptic neuron. Most receptors that function in neurotransmission are large transmembrane proteins. On the extracellular surface of the protein is a specific series of amino acid residues called the active site.
"The active site, also called the orthosteric site, is shaped to allow molecules of neurotransmitter to bind to the receptor. Receptors are classified into one of two main categories: Ionotropic receptors and Metabotropic receptors . Neurotransmitters are the chemicals released at the presynaptic terminal that then bind to the postsynaptic cell."
"A neurotransmitter system is the neurotransmitter and everything needed for the synthesis of the transmitter, the packaging of the transmitter into vesicles, the proteins necessary for reuptake of the transmitter into the presynaptic cell, degradation of the transmitter, and postsynaptic signaling of the transmitter. In the following chapters, we will discuss various neurotransmitter systems. Though there are neurons that can release more than one type of neurotransmitter , most neurons release just one type of neurotransmitter, allowing neurons to be identified by the neurotransmitter they release ."
"The different neurotransmitters can be separated into three different chemical categories:  Amino Acids  Amines  Peptides  To identify whether a chemical can be classified as a neurotransmitter, it must meet the following requirements:  The chemical has to be stored or located within the presynaptic neuron. Both immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry can use antibodies directed against a specific protein important for neurotransmitter synthesis or storage to localize the protein to a neuron and determine whether a neuron has the appropriate machinery to make the neurotransmitter and thus likely release the neurotransmitter. The chemical has to be released from the presynaptic neuron following appropriate stimulation."
"When the chemical is applied to the postsynaptic cell by an experimenter, the response of the postsynaptic cell should be similar to the response following normal release from the presynaptic cell. Neurotransmitters can be classified on their function as either ‘excitatory’ or ‘inhibitory’. In the following chapters, we will see that glutamate is an example of an excitatory neurotransmitter."
"This is because the binding of glutamate to the postsynaptic cell typically generates excitatory postsynaptic potentials, which makes the inside of the cell closer to zero and thus closer to threshold potential for the cell, increasing the likelihood of firing an action potential. GABA and Glycine, however, are typically considered as inhibitory neurotransmitters. This is because the binding of either GABA or glycine to the postsynaptic cell typically generates inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which makes the inside of the cell more negative and further from threshold potential of the cell, decreasing the likelihood of firing an action potential."
"Most neurotransmitters, however, can produced either excitatory postsynaptic potentials or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials depending on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor that they bind to. Neurotransmitters each bind to specific receptors that produce specific postsynaptic responses. The subsequent chapters will review the main neurotransmitters including their synthesis, storage, and their receptors."
"Ionotropic receptors are also called neurotransmitter-gated or ligand-gated channels. They are ion channels that open in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. They are primarily located along the dendrites or cell body, but they can be present anywhere along the neuron if there is a synapse."
"Ionotropic receptors are important for receiving incoming information from other neurons. Physically, ionotropic receptors are transmembrane proteins with a large-diameter pore through which ions can pass. Although ionotropic receptors are ion channels, they open in a different way than the voltage-gated ion channels needed for propagation of the action potential."
"The ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated, which means that a specific molecule, such as a neurotransmitter, must bind to the receptor to cause the channel to open and allow ion flow. As seen in previous chapters, the voltage-gated channels open in response to the membrane potential reaching threshold . Ionotopic channels are often said to use a direct signaling mechanism because the neurotransmitter binds directly to the ion channel that it is going to open."
"These channels only open when a specific ligand binds to the active site on the extracellular side of the protein. Neurotransmitters and receptors fit together like a lock and key; only certain neurotransmitters are able to bind to and open certain receptors. Once a neurotransmitter activates the ionotropic receptor, ions will move through the channel based on the electrochemical gradient for that ion."
"As a result of ion movement, the cell’s membrane potential will change. For example, if the ionotropic channel allowed for movement of sodium, the electrochemical gradient for sodium will promote sodium rushing into the cell, causing the inside of the cell to get more positive . Ionotropic receptors are able to induce a change in membrane potential very rapidly, on the scale of milliseconds."
"Due to the nature of the amino acid residues that make up the pore of ionotropic receptors, they can be very selective for certain ions. For example, negatively charged residues lining the inside of the pore repel negatively charged Cl– ions while allowing positively charged cations to pass through the channel. Metabotropic receptors , are membrane-bound proteins."
"These receptor complexes cause the cell to change its metabolism in a way that leads to either excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic cell. Like ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors are primarily located along the dendrites or cell body, but they can be present anywhere along the neuron if there is a synapse. Unlike ionotropic receptors , ions do not pass through GPCRs."
"Instead, metabotropic receptors use the actions of G proteins, proteins which induce changes in neuronal excitability through the action of second messenger signaling molecules. Due to these extra steps, GPCRs have slower effects than ionotropic receptors, but they can have long-lasting effects, unlike the brief action of a postsynaptic potential. G-proteins are enzymes with three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma."
"There are multiple types of alpha subunits , and each initiate different cellular cascades in the neuron. Functionally speaking, these G-proteins are capable of binding to molecules of guanosine triphosphate  or guanosine diphosphate . Chemically similar to ATP, GTP can function as a source of energy."
"G-proteins themselves exhibit catalytic activity of GTP. This means that they are capable of breaking down GTP into the less-energetic GDP. When GTP is bound to the GPCR, the receptor is active."
"When this molecule is hydrolyzed into GDP, the receptor becomes inactive. A metabotropic receptor or GPCR is a transmembrane protein that has an extracellular binding site for a neurotransmitter. Metabotropic receptors are physically linked to G-proteins, which exist on the inner surface of the cell membrane."
"When a neurotransmitter binds to a GPCR it undergoes a conformational change, which allows the receptor to interact with an associated inactivated G-protein complex. The complex that binds is specific to the receptor; different metabotropic receptors for the same neurotransmitter can have different effects in the cell due to which G-protein binds. Once coupled to the receptor, the GDP molecule is exchanged for a GTP molecule and the G-protein becomes activated."
"After activation, the G-protein complex will separate into the alpha-GTP subunit and the beta-gamma subunit. Both components can alter the function of effector proteins in the cell. Effector protein functions can range from altering ion permeability across the membrane by opening ion channels to initiating second messenger cascades."
"Second messenger cascades can have long-term, widespread, and diverse cellular effects including activation of cellular enzymes or altering gene transcription. The cyclic AMP  second messenger pathway is used by many GPCRs. When a neurotransmitter binds to a GPCR, it causes activation of the Gαs alpha subunit."
"The Gαs subunit  translocates within the cell to stimulate an effector enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. When activated, adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP in the cytoplasm. cAMP is considered a 2nd messenger ."
"As a second messenger, cAMP has the ability to alter proteins inside the cell. Specifically, cAMP activates another enzyme called protein kinase A  by binding to the regulatory subunits, allowing the catalytic  subunits to separate and become active. PKA is a kinase, a group of enzymes that add a phosphate molecule to proteins, a mechanism called phosphorylation."
"The addition of the phosphate changes the activity of the protein and how it functions in the cell. Typically, phosphorylation activates proteins within the cell. The end effects of this pathway will depend on which proteins are targeted."
"For example, cAMP can gate ion channels and PKA can phosphorylate ion channels altering permeability and membrane potential. Phosphorylation can open the channel, or it may modulate the activity of the channel, making the channel easier to open or remain open longer. In addition to altering ion channel function, PKA can phosphorylate other proteins important for neuron function, such as proteins involved with neurotransmitter synthesis and release."
"One other critical target of PKA phosphorylation is the transcription factor CREB . Transcription factors bind to DNA in the nucleus and change the rate of gene transcription. Phosphorylation by PKA can cause CREB to initiate transcription of genes, creating new proteins for the neuron."
"Depending on which genes are transcribed, the effects on the neuron can be long-lasting. Overall, neurotransmitters working through GPCRs and second messenger cascades  can cause a diverse range of cellular effects: from opening ion channels, to changing protein activity via phosphorylation, to altering the proteins synthesized in the neuron. Alternatively, a GPCR that is coupled with Gαi causes a decrease in excitability."
"In many ways, Gαi proteins serve the opposite function as Gαs proteins—the “i” stands for inhibitory. Whereas activation of Gαs increases the action of adenylyl cyclase, Gαi proteins decrease adenylyl cyclase activity. Therefore, Gαi activation decreases the intracellular concentration of cAMP, in turn decreasing PKA activity."
"Given the function of PKA as a kinase that increases cellular excitation as described above, a GPCR coupled to Gαi that causes decreased PKA activity inhibits cellular activity through multiple mechanisms, some of which include decreased current through receptors, decreased trafficking of receptors to the presynaptic neuronal membrane, and decreased transcription of certain genes. Generally, Gαq is an excitatory G-protein alpha subunit. The Gαq subunit initiates a separate signaling pathway in the cell by activating the effector enzyme phospholipase C."
"Phospholipase C targets PIP2 , which is a phospholipid present in the plasma membrane of the cell. PLC will split PIP2 into two separate second messenger molecules: the soluble IP3  and membrane-embedded DAG . DAG remains in the membrane and interacts with protein kinase C ."
"PKC is an enzyme that can act to increase neurotransmitter release probability. One function of IP3 is to move to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it opens calcium channels embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum and allows calcium to flow into the cytosol, elevating intracellular calcium levels. This increase in calcium concentration can depolarize the cell and activate calcium-dependent processes, which often lead to cellular excitation."
"Calcium also acts as a second messenger in the cell. One important effect is the binding of calcium to the calmodulin protein. This complex can then activate another kinase, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ."
"Both PKC and CaMK can phosphorylate specific cellular and nuclear proteins like PKA. So, depending on the type of Gα subunit that the G-protein is associated with, there will be different outcomes for the cell. In general, Gαs will “stimulate” the cell by activating adenylyl cyclase."
Gαi will “inhibit” the cell by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. Gαq will “stimulate” the cell by activating phospholipase C. One characteristic of GPCR activation is the signal amplification that takes place.
"One receptor is able to activate more than one G-protein complex. The effector protein activated by the G-protein can create many second messengers, and the activated protein kinases can each phosphorylate multiple cellular proteins. This means that one neurotransmitter can have a significant effect on cellular function."
"Eventually, the cascade initiated by binding of the neurotransmitter to the GPCR needs to end. The alpha subunit of the G-protein is able to convert the bound GTP back to GDP after a short period of time, inactivating the G-protein. The alpha subunit will then interact with a beta-gamma subunit and stay in the resting state until activated by another GPCR."
"Enzymes in the cell called protein phosphatases find and remove the phosphate groups added to cellular proteins by the protein kinases. Finally, other cellular mechanisms exist to remove calcium from the cytoplasm and degrade other second messengers. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at the synapse."
"In this chapter, we will introduce basic information about neurotransmitters and how they are identified. Next, an overview of neurotransmitter receptors will be provided. Receptors are proteins located on the postsynaptic cell that are capable of sending a signal to change the function or activity of the postsynaptic neuron."
"Most receptors that function in neurotransmission are large transmembrane proteins. On the extracellular surface of the protein is a specific series of amino acid residues called the active site. The active site, also called the orthosteric site, is shaped to allow molecules of neurotransmitter to bind to the receptor."
"Receptors are classified into one of two main categories: Ionotropic receptors and Metabotropic receptors . Neurotransmitters are the chemicals released at the presynaptic terminal that then bind to the postsynaptic cell. A neurotransmitter system is the neurotransmitter and everything needed for the synthesis of the transmitter, the packaging of the transmitter into vesicles, the proteins necessary for reuptake of the transmitter into the presynaptic cell, degradation of the transmitter, and postsynaptic signaling of the transmitter."
"In the following chapters, we will discuss various neurotransmitter systems. Though there are neurons that can release more than one type of neurotransmitter , most neurons release just one type of neurotransmitter, allowing neurons to be identified by the neurotransmitter they release . The different neurotransmitters can be separated into three different chemical categories:  Amino Acids  Amines  Peptides  To identify whether a chemical can be classified as a neurotransmitter, it must meet the following requirements:  The chemical has to be stored or located within the presynaptic neuron."
"Both immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry can use antibodies directed against a specific protein important for neurotransmitter synthesis or storage to localize the protein to a neuron and determine whether a neuron has the appropriate machinery to make the neurotransmitter and thus likely release the neurotransmitter. The chemical has to be released from the presynaptic neuron following appropriate stimulation. When the chemical is applied to the postsynaptic cell by an experimenter, the response of the postsynaptic cell should be similar to the response following normal release from the presynaptic cell."
"Neurotransmitters can be classified on their function as either ‘excitatory’ or ‘inhibitory’. In the following chapters, we will see that glutamate is an example of an excitatory neurotransmitter. This is because the binding of glutamate to the postsynaptic cell typically generates excitatory postsynaptic potentials, which makes the inside of the cell closer to zero and thus closer to threshold potential for the cell, increasing the likelihood of firing an action potential."
"GABA and Glycine, however, are typically considered as inhibitory neurotransmitters. This is because the binding of either GABA or glycine to the postsynaptic cell typically generates inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which makes the inside of the cell more negative and further from threshold potential of the cell, decreasing the likelihood of firing an action potential. Most neurotransmitters, however, can produced either excitatory postsynaptic potentials or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials depending on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor that they bind to."
"Neurotransmitters each bind to specific receptors that produce specific postsynaptic responses. The subsequent chapters will review the main neurotransmitters including their synthesis, storage, and their receptors. Ionotropic receptors are also called neurotransmitter-gated or ligand-gated channels."
"They are ion channels that open in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. They are primarily located along the dendrites or cell body, but they can be present anywhere along the neuron if there is a synapse. Ionotropic receptors are important for receiving incoming information from other neurons."
"Physically, ionotropic receptors are transmembrane proteins with a large-diameter pore through which ions can pass. Although ionotropic receptors are ion channels, they open in a different way than the voltage-gated ion channels needed for propagation of the action potential. The ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated, which means that a specific molecule, such as a neurotransmitter, must bind to the receptor to cause the channel to open and allow ion flow."
"As seen in previous chapters, the voltage-gated channels open in response to the membrane potential reaching threshold . Ionotopic channels are often said to use a direct signaling mechanism because the neurotransmitter binds directly to the ion channel that it is going to open. These channels only open when a specific ligand binds to the active site on the extracellular side of the protein."
"Neurotransmitters and receptors fit together like a lock and key; only certain neurotransmitters are able to bind to and open certain receptors. Once a neurotransmitter activates the ionotropic receptor, ions will move through the channel based on the electrochemical gradient for that ion. As a result of ion movement, the cell’s membrane potential will change."
"For example, if the ionotropic channel allowed for movement of sodium, the electrochemical gradient for sodium will promote sodium rushing into the cell, causing the inside of the cell to get more positive . Ionotropic receptors are able to induce a change in membrane potential very rapidly, on the scale of milliseconds. Due to the nature of the amino acid residues that make up the pore of ionotropic receptors, they can be very selective for certain ions."
"For example, negatively charged residues lining the inside of the pore repel negatively charged Cl– ions while allowing positively charged cations to pass through the channel. Metabotropic receptors , are membrane-bound proteins. These receptor complexes cause the cell to change its metabolism in a way that leads to either excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic cell."
"Like ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors are primarily located along the dendrites or cell body, but they can be present anywhere along the neuron if there is a synapse. Unlike ionotropic receptors , ions do not pass through GPCRs. Instead, metabotropic receptors use the actions of G proteins, proteins which induce changes in neuronal excitability through the action of second messenger signaling molecules."
"Due to these extra steps, GPCRs have slower effects than ionotropic receptors, but they can have long-lasting effects, unlike the brief action of a postsynaptic potential. G-proteins are enzymes with three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma. There are multiple types of alpha subunits , and each initiate different cellular cascades in the neuron."
"Functionally speaking, these G-proteins are capable of binding to molecules of guanosine triphosphate  or guanosine diphosphate . Chemically similar to ATP, GTP can function as a source of energy. G-proteins themselves exhibit catalytic activity of GTP."
"This means that they are capable of breaking down GTP into the less-energetic GDP. When GTP is bound to the GPCR, the receptor is active. When this molecule is hydrolyzed into GDP, the receptor becomes inactive."
"A metabotropic receptor or GPCR is a transmembrane protein that has an extracellular binding site for a neurotransmitter. Metabotropic receptors are physically linked to G-proteins, which exist on the inner surface of the cell membrane. When a neurotransmitter binds to a GPCR it undergoes a conformational change, which allows the receptor to interact with an associated inactivated G-protein complex."
"The complex that binds is specific to the receptor; different metabotropic receptors for the same neurotransmitter can have different effects in the cell due to which G-protein binds. Once coupled to the receptor, the GDP molecule is exchanged for a GTP molecule and the G-protein becomes activated. After activation, the G-protein complex will separate into the alpha-GTP subunit and the beta-gamma subunit."

"Finally, other cellular mechanisms exist to remove calcium from the cytoplasm and degrade other second messengers. Neurotransmitters are the substances that are released at chemical synapses, and they are the signaling molecules that allow neurons to communicate with one another. To date, scientists have identified more than 100 neurotransmitters."
"A few criteria must be met for a molecule to be called a neurotransmitter. First, the neurotransmitter must be synthesized within the presynaptic neuron. Second, the neurotransmitter must be released by the presynaptic neuron in response to stimulation."
"Third, when a postsynaptic neuron is treated with the neurotransmitter by a researcher, the molecule must cause the same effect in the postsynaptic neuron as when it is released by a presynaptic neuron. The next several chapters will cover a subset of neurotransmitter systems. For each neurotransmitter system, we will provide information on: the synthesis and storage of the neurotransmitter in the presynaptic cell; the receptors that the neurotransmitter binds to on the postsynaptic cell and the postsynaptic effects; and how neurotransmitter signaling is terminated."
There are two main categories of neurotransmitters: small molecule neurotransmitters and peptide neurotransmitters . Synthesis and storage of these neurotransmitter groups differ. Small molecule neurotransmitters are synthesized and stored in the terminal for fast release.
"Neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body and must be transported to the terminal, which can lead to slower release. Additionally, a neuron typically will synthesize and release only one type of small molecule neurotransmitter, but can synthesize and release more than one neuropeptide. Molecules of neurotransmitters are often stored in synaptic vesicles before being released."
Synaptic vesicles are tiny spheres of neurotransmitter enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer just like the cell membrane. These vesicles can be roughly characterized into two classes:  Small vesicles. Small vesicles are responsible for storage of small molecule neurotransmitters.
"Given the size of neurotransmitters, we can estimate that thousands to tens of thousands of molecules of neurotransmitter can be stored in each vesicle. Small vesicles store many of the neurotransmitters we most often think of, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Small vesicles are almost always exclusively found in the axon terminals."
"Large dense-core vesicles. These vesicles are much larger than small vesicles. They store peptides such as dynorphin or enkephalin, which have chemical structures much larger than the small molecule neurotransmitters."
"Since these peptides are packaged into their vesicles near the nucleus, large dense-core vesicles can be found in the cell bodies and all along the axons in addition to the axon terminal. Let’s first discuss the small molecule neurotransmitters. The small molecule neurotransmitters can be divided into two main groups: amino acid neurotransmitters and biogenic amines ."
"In addition to acting as neurotransmitters, the amino acids glutamate and glycine are used to synthesize proteins in all cell types throughout the body. GABA  is a metabolite of glutamate, but is not used in protein synthesis in the body. The biogenic amines include serotonin, histamine, and the subgroup catecholamines: dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine."
Acetylcholine does not fit into either division but is still considered a small molecule neurotransmitter. Most small molecule neurotransmitters are synthesized by enzymes that are located in the cytoplasm . This means that small molecule neurotransmitters can be synthesized and packaged for storage in the presynaptic terminal using enzymes present in the terminal.
"In the last chapter, the mechanisms of ionotropic and metabotropic  were covered. In the chapters that follow, we will focus on a subset of neurotransmitter systems and identify the different neurotransmitter receptors and their function. Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter discovered and chemically isolated, a feat which earned two researchers the shared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936."
"One of the two scientists, a German pharmacologist named Otto Loewi, stimulated the vagus nerve connected to an isolated frog heart, which caused the heart rate to slow down. When he applied the surrounding solution from this experiment to a second heart, he observed that the second heart also slowed down, despite having no physical connection to the first heart. From this, he concluded that a chemical was being released by the vagus nerve that was decreasing the heart rate."
"This chemical was first called Vagusstoff, the German word meaning Vagus substance. Today, we know it as acetylcholine. Acetylcholine  is a small molecule neurotransmitter best known for its role at the neuromuscular junction, the synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber."
"In the presynaptic terminal, acetylcholine is synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A  and choline via the enzyme choline acetyltransferase . The level of enzyme activity is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis pathway. The presence of ChAT in a neuron is used as a biochemical marker for neurons that produce acetylcholine."
"Acetylcholine is packaged into small vesicles for storage in the terminal via the vesicular acetylcholine transporter , a protein found in the synaptic vesicle membrane. Acetylcholine is able to act at both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and activity at both receptor classes is essential for normal function. The ionotropic receptors of the nervous system are called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors because they can be activated by nicotine in addition to acetylcholine."
"Nicotinic receptors are located primarily outside of the central nervous system in the periphery. Specifically, the nicotinic receptors are used at the neuromuscular junction, which is the junction of a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine is released by motor neurons, where it activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle cells."
This excites the muscle cells and causes them to contract. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are non-selective cation channels. The channel is closed when acetylcholine is not bound to the receptor.
"The nicotinic receptor has two binding sites for acetylcholine. When acetylcholine is bound to both sites on the receptor, the pore of the channel opens to allow movement of both sodium and potassium. This ionotropic receptor is an example of a direct mechanism of action, due to the fact that the receptor and the channel are located on the same protein."
"The properties of the receptors cause more sodium to enter than potassium leaves, ultimately causing the membrane to depolarize. Thus, nicotinic receptors are always excitatory  and cause depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. On the other hand, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are GPCRs  and utilize an indirect mechanism of action."
"When acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors, the beta-gamma subunit of the G-protein complex translocates in the cell to affect potassium channels in the cell membrane, causing them to open. Due to the electrochemical gradient of potassium, potassium will leave the cell and cause membrane hyperpolarization, or IPSPs. Muscarinic receptors are located in the heart, and their activation causes a decrease in heart rate due to this hyperpolarization caused by the muscarinic receptors  Different drugs have the ability to interact within a neurotransmitter system, in many cases by directly interacting with a neurotransmitter receptor protein."
There are two main classes of drugs that we will discuss: agonists and antagonists. An agonist is a drug that binds to a receptor and acts to activate the normal function of that receptor. An antagonist is a drug that binds to a receptor that acts to block the normal function of that receptor.
"The acetylcholine neurotransmitter system can be used as an example to see the function of both agonists and antagonists. Nicotine is an agonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor . Normally, the nicotinic receptor causes excitatory postsynaptic potentials."
"Because nicotine is an agonist for this receptor, when it binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor it also causes excitatory post synaptic potentials and lead to an overall increase in activity. There are also antagonists for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Curare, a substance that comes from the resin of a tree in South America and α-bungarotoxin, a toxin found in Krait snake venom, are both examples of antagonists for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."
"Recall that normally the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor causes excitatory post synaptic potentials. As antagonists, curare and α-bungarotoxin will block excitatory postsynaptic potentials, leading to an overall decrease in activity. Muscarine, a substance found in certain mushrooms, is an agonist for the muscarinic receptor ."
"As an agonist, muscarine will promote the normal function of the receptor. Normally, muscarinic receptors produce inhibitory post synaptic potentials. Thus, muscarine binding to muscarinic receptor will cause inhibitory post synaptic potentials, causing an overall decrease in activity."
"Atropine is a drug that acts as an antagonist at the muscarinic receptor. Antagonists block the normal function of the receptor. Because normally the muscarinic receptor is inhibitory, atropine will block the normal inhibitory effects, leading to an overall increase in activity."
"The enzyme acetylcholinesterase, located in the synaptic cleft and within the postsynaptic membrane, chemically breaks down acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline. Choline can also undergo the process of reuptake which will remove choline from the synapse  and bring it into the presynaptic cell through the choline transporter. Acetylcholinesterase is an important enzyme to regulate acetylcholine within the body."
"Recall that acetylcholine is used at the neuromuscular junction between motor neurons and skeletal muscles. The acetylcholinesterase enzyme prevents continuous stimulation of our muscles, allowing tight control. In fact, acetylcholinesterase is one of the fastest acting enzymes within the body."
"Nerve gas and neostigmine  both act to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing excessive acetylcholine signaling. Glutamate is an amino acid transmitter and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Glutamate is the same as the amino acid glutamic acid."
"There is more glutamate per volume of brain tissue than any other neurotransmitter. In the presynaptic terminal, glutamine is converted into glutamate via the enzyme glutaminase, which is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis pathway. Glutamate is packaged into small vesicles for storage via the vesicular glutamate transporter ."
Staining for the presence of vGLUT is one way that researchers are able to identify glutamatergic neurons. Glutamate can activate both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and opens non-selective cation channels.
"There are three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors: AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. The AMPA  and kainate receptors allow both sodium and potassium to cross the membrane. Although potassium can leave the cell when the receptors open, the electrochemical gradient driving sodium ion movement is stronger than the gradient driving potassium movement, resulting in a depolarization of the membrane potential."
"The NMDA  receptor requires the binding of glutamate to open, but it is also dependent on voltage. When the membrane potential is below, at, or near rest, a magnesium ion blocks the open NMDA receptor and prevents other ions from moving through the channel. Once the cell depolarizes, the magnesium block is expelled from the receptor, which allows sodium, potassium, and calcium to cross the membrane."
"The voltage change needed to open the NMDA receptor is usually a result of AMPA receptor activation. Glutamate action is terminated by two mechanisms. Reuptake of glutamate molecules into the presynaptic terminal can occur, or glutamate can be transported into nearby glial cells."
"The excitatory amino acid transporters are sodium co-transporters and use the sodium electrochemical gradient to drive neurotransmitter transport. Within glial cells, glutamate is converted into glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is then transported out of the glial cell and back into the presynaptic terminal for use in future glutamate synthesis."
"If glutamate is transported back into the presynaptic terminal, it can be repackaged in synaptic vesicles. Glutamate is then used to synthesize Gamma-aminobutyric acid , the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. According to one estimate, about 25% of neurons in the brain are GABAergic."
"In the presynaptic terminal, glutamate is converted into GABA via the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase , which—like the other synthesis pathways—is the rate-limiting step. GAD is often used as a biochemical marker for the presence of GABAergic neurons. GABA is packaged into small vesicles for storage in the terminal via the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter ."
"Glycine is another inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter, but unlike GABA, is mostly used by neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase converts the amino acid serine into glycine in the presynaptic terminal. The rate-limiting step for glycine synthesis occurs earlier in the pathway prior to serine synthesis."
"Glycine is packaged into small vesicles by the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter  like GABA. GABA and glycine receptors are chloride channels. Since an increase in chloride permeability across the membrane is inhibitory, the binding of GABA or glycine to their respective ionotropic receptor will cause inhibition."
"Like glutamate, GABA and glycine action are terminated by either reuptake into the presynaptic terminal and packaging in synaptic vesicles or through transport into glial cells where breakdown can occur. The GABA and glycine transporter also use the sodium electrochemical gradient to drive the movement of the transmitter across the membrane. The biogenic amines encompass multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, histamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine."
"Included within the biogenic amines is a separate group of neurotransmitters, the catecholamines. This chapter will provide information for only serotonin and histamine. Catecholamines are covered in the following chapter."
"Serotonin, a biogenic amine neurotransmitter, is known for its role in mood. As with dopamine , there are only a few areas of the brain that synthesize serotonin, the major one being the Raphe nucleus in the brain stem. The enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase is the first step of serotonin biosynthesis, converting the amino acid tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan and is often used as a marker to identify serotonergic neurons."
"This is also the rate-limiting step of the synthesis pathway. Then aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase converts the 5-hydroxytryptophan into serotonin. Serotonin is packaged into small vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter similar to the other monoamine neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine."
"Serotonin binds to many different classes of receptors, including both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Most of the serotonin receptors are metabotropic receptors that utilize G-proteins to cause the opening of ion channels, or alter the activity of phospholipase C or adenylyl cyclase. Due to the large number of different serotonin receptors, the effects of serotonin can vary depending on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor."
"Only one class of serotonin receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and utilize a direct mechanism of action. Like the other monoamines, serotonin goes through reuptake and is transported back into the presynaptic terminal via the serotonin transporter . The difference between serotonin and the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine is that monoamine oxidase is the only enzyme used for degradation."
"Finally, histamine is another biogenic amine transmitter that is synthesized from histidine through the action of histamine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting step of the pathway. Like the other monoamine neurotransmitters, it is packaged into small synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter. Though histamine has known roles in the immune system with allergic reactions and the inflammatory response, this chemical can also act as a hormone and a neurotransmitter within the central nervous system."
"Catecholamines are a class of neurotransmitters that are found within the larger class of neurotransmitters, biogenic amines. The catecholamines share many characteristics. Dopamine, a catecholamine transmitter, plays many roles in the nervous system, but it is best known for its roles in reward and movement."
"In the presynaptic terminal, the amino acid tyrosine is converted into DOPA via tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of all the catecholamines. DOPA is then converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. Dopamine is packaged into small synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter ."
"Unlike glutamate or GABA, dopamine-producing neurons are not widely abundant in the brain. Instead, there are generally only a few patches of neurons that produce dopamine, most of which are found in the midbrain. Two areas include the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra."
Dopamine binds to metabotropic receptors on postsynaptic cells. There are two classes of dopamine metabotropic receptors: D1-like receptors and D2-like receptors. D1-like receptors are typically associated with Gαs and cause activation of the cAMP/adenylyl cyclase second messenger system and the generation of EPSPs in the postsynaptic cell.
"D2-like receptors, however, are typically associated with Gαi that inhibits the cAMP/adenylyl cyclase second messenger system and generate IPSPs in the postsynaptic cell. Dopamine action is terminated by reuptake into the presynaptic terminal via the dopamine transporter . Once inside the cell, dopamine is either degraded via the actions of either monoamine oxidase  or catechol-O-methyltransferase , or it is repackaged into vesicles."
"Norepinephrine-producing cells are localized in the pons of the brain stem, a structure called the locus coeruleus. The locus coeruleus is very small, but these neurons send projections widely throughout the brain. Outside of the brain, we think of norepinephrine as being responsible for triggering the sympathetic nervous system response of the body, the “fight-or-flight” reaction that prepares the body for physical activity in times of fear or acute stress."
"In neurons that release norepinephrine, which is another catecholamine transmitter, once dopamine is packaged into small synaptic vesicles, a membrane-bound enzyme called dopamine beta-hydroxylase converts dopamine into norepinephrine. Therefore, unlike the other small molecule neurotransmitters, norepinephrine is synthesized within the vesicles, not in the cytoplasm. Like dopamine, the rate-limiting step of this synthesis pathway is the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase."
"Norepinephrine binds to metabotropic adrenergic receptors . The binding of norepinephrine to its receptor activates second messenger signaling cascades that will cause either EPSPs or IPSPs, depending on the receptor subtype. Termination of norepinephrine signaling is similar to the termination of dopamine signaling."
"Reuptake into the presynaptic terminal occurs via the norepinephrine transporter , and then the transmitter is either degraded within the cell by MAO or COMT or repackaged into synaptic vesicles. Epinephrine, also called adrenaline, is a catecholamine, but it is often considered a hormone instead of a neurotransmitter. Epinephrine is primarily released by the adrenal medulla into the circulation; it is used as a neurotransmitter in only a small number of neurons."
"Epinephrine is synthesized from norepinephrine in the cytoplasm by the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, so epinephrine synthesis requires norepinephrine to exit the vesicles where it was synthesized. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, epinephrine is repackaged into small vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter. Epinephrine also binds to α and β adrenergic receptors  and causes similar activity when bound to these receptors."
"Epinephrine, similarly to norepinephrine, also goes through reuptake into the presynaptic cell. Further, it is also degraded within the cell by both MAO or COMT or repackaged into synaptic vesicles. Although we generally think of neurotransmitters as neurochemicals that function as described above, there are a few atypical neurotransmitters that don’t quite fit the mold of the other chemical signals."
Neuropeptides are a class of large signaling molecules that some neurons synthesize. Neuropeptides are different from the traditional neurotransmitters because of their chemical size. Neuropeptides are a short string of amino acids and are known to have a wide range of effects from emotions to pain perception.
"Unlike small molecule neurotransmitters, neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body and transported to the axon terminal. Like other proteins, neuropeptides are synthesized from mRNA into peptide chains made from amino acids. In most cases, a larger precursor molecule called the prepropeptide is translated into the original amino acid sequence in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
"The prepropeptide is processed further to the propeptide stage. The remaining processing and packaging of the final neuropeptide into a vesicle occurs in the Golgi apparatus. Monoamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin have a molecular weight around 150-200, while one of the smaller neuropeptides, enkephalin, has a molecular weight of 570."
"One of the largest neuropeptides, dynorphin, has a molecular weight greater than 2,000. Because of their large size, neuropeptides have to be packaged in dense core vesicles very close to the site of production near the nucleus, rather than in clear vesicles right at the terminal. These large vesicles must then move from the soma to the terminal."
"The packaged peptides need to be transported to the presynaptic terminals to be released into the synaptic cleft. Organelles, vesicles, and proteins can be moved from the cell body to the terminal via anterograde transport or from the terminal to the cell body via retrograde transport. Anterograde transport can be either fast or slow."
The packaged neuropeptides are transported to the synaptic terminals via fast anterograde axonal transport mechanisms. Neuropeptides such as enkephalin and dynorphin are agonists at a class of receptors called the opioid receptors. These opioid receptors fall into four main types.
"The three classical opioid receptors are named using Greek letters: δ , μ , and κ ; the fourth class is the nociceptin receptor. All of these receptors are inhibitory metabotropic receptors which signal using the Gαi protein. These receptors are expressed in several brain areas, but expression is particularly heavy in the periaqueductal gray, a midbrain area that functions to inhibit the sensation of pain."
"Drugs that activate the opioid receptors, like morphine, oxycontin, or fentanyl, are the most effective clinical treatments that we know of for acute pain. Unfortunately, these same drugs also represent a tremendous health risk, as opioid drugs can be lethal in overdose and have a high risk of substance use disorder. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid neurotransmitters that are a bit unusual compared to the other neurotransmitters that we have covered."
"First, they signal in a retrograde manner. This means that the endocannabinoids neurotransmitters are released by the postsynaptic cell and bind to receptors on the presynaptic cell. Additionally, endocannabinoids are not packaged into vesicles and released by fusion with the cell membrane."
"Instead, when the postsynaptic cell has an action potential, it causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the postsynaptic cell to open, and for calcium ions to rush into the postsynaptic cell. The local increase in calcium concentration within the postsynaptic cell triggers the cell to synthesize endocannabinoids. Again, these neurotransmitters are not stored in vesicles like the other neurotransmitters that have been discussed."
"Instead, these lipid neurotransmitters are made on demand, or synthesized ‘de novo’. As lipids, the endocannabinoids are membrane permeable and can diffuse out of the cell through the cell membrane. The two most well-characterized eCBs in humans are called 2-Arachidonoylglycerol  and Anandamide ."
"The endocannabinoids bind to one of two receptors, CB1 or CB2. Both receptor types are inhibitory metabotropic receptors that are located on the presynaptic cell and coupled to Gαi. Generally, CB1 receptors are found in the nervous system, while the CB2 receptors are found elsewhere in the body, such as in the immune system."
"Activity of the metabotropic CB1 receptors causes presynaptic calcium channels to close, reducing the concentration of calcium in the presynaptic cell, and thus decreasing the amount of neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic cell. The endocannabinoid system is widely used by various systems in the body. It is estimated that endocannabinoid receptors are the most abundant GPCRs in the whole body."
These substances were named because they are endogenous chemicals that are functionally similar to compounds found in plants of the genus Cannabis. One reason cannabis is used is because of its ability to interact with our endocannabinoid receptors. The nervous system is capable of signaling via the gas nitric oxide .
"This gas transmitter is not stored in vesicles, but is synthesized as it is needed. NO is formed when the amino acid arginine is degraded by the enzyme NO synthase . Because NO is a gas, it easily permeates across cell membranes."
"Therefore, the receptors for NO do not need to be transmembrane proteins expressed on the cell surface. Instead, the receptor for NO is an intracellular receptor called soluble guanylate cyclase . SGC works through a signaling pathway that is different from other metabotropic receptors so far described."
"SGC is linked with the signaling molecule cyclic GMP , which activates protein kinase G . PKG can either be excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the intracellular components. Drugs and toxins can alter neuron functioning in a range of ways, from activation to inhibition and all levels of modulation."
"Although many drugs exist that alter molecular process typical of many cells, this lesson will focus on neuron-specific targets. As we have seen, the synapse is an incredibly complex structure, and for small molecule neurotransmitters, the entire “lifecycle” of the transmitter occurs in this space: synthesis, packaging, release, action, and termination. This means there are numerous targets upon which drugs and toxins can act to alter synaptic communication."
"Drugs can alter neurotransmitter synthesis pathways, either increasing or decreasing the amount of neurotransmitter made in the terminal, affecting how much transmitter is released. An example of this is administration of L-DOPA, a dopamine precursor molecule in the dopamine synthesis pathway that results in increased dopamine production; it is used as a treatment for Parkinson’s Disease. Neurotransmitter packaging is another site of possible drug action."
"Reserpine, which has been used to treat high blood pressure, blocks the transport of the monoamine transmitters into vesicles by inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter . This decreases the amount of neurotransmitter stored and the amount of neurotransmitter released in response to an action potential. The neurotransmitter receptors are another critical location for drug and toxin action."
"Agonists mimic neurotransmitter effects, whereas antagonists block neurotransmitter effects. Muscimol, a component of some mushrooms, is an agonist for the ionotropic GABA receptor. Bicuculine, a component of some plants, is an antagonist to this receptor and blocks the action of GABA."
"Additionally, many chemicals are able to modulate receptors in either a positive or negative fashion. Alcohol binds to the GABA receptor and increases the time the receptor is open when GABA binds. Finally, neurotransmitter degradation and reuptake can also be altered by drugs and toxins."
"Depending on the neurotransmitter, enzymes located in either the synapse or in the terminal are responsible for degradation of the transmitter, and these enzyme can be blocked by drugs. Organophosphates are found in many pesticides and prevent the action of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synapse. This inhibition increases acetylcholine action on the postsynaptic neuron."
"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors  prevent monoamine oxidase from degrading the biogenic amine neurotransmitters. MAOIs have been used as antidepressants since they increase the amount of transmitter available. Additionally, drugs can prevent the reuptake of neurotransmitters into the presynaptic terminal."
"Cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter, which results in increased action of dopamine in the synapse. Drugs and toxins can also affect neuron function by acting outside of the synapse. For example, some chemicals change voltage-gated ion channel dynamics."
"Veratridine, a compound found in plants from the lily family, prevents voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivating. Initially, this causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, but it can quickly lead to excitotoxicity. The nervous system is one of the most complex systems that we know of."
"Parts of this system malfunction frequently, and the results are a wide range of neurological disorders that affect humans, from injury to genetic disorders. The gross anatomy of the nervous system is an important foundation to the studies of other aspects of neuroscience. This chapter covers some of the major anatomical structures in the nervous system."
"Broadly speaking, the nervous system can be divided into two main categories: The central nervous system  and the peripheral nervous system . Simply put, the CNS is the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS is all the other nerve cells in the body in the periphery. The two systems are not isolated from each other; information passes rapidly between the PNS and the CNS, and vice versa."
"When a signal that originates in the PNS moves to the CNS, we sometimes say that the signal is incoming or ascending, while the CNS to PNS direction is outgoing or descending. Information that arrives into the CNS is also called an afferent signal, while information leaving the CNS is an efferent signal. These two terms are frequently confused, but you can use the knowledge of other words that start with “e” to remember that an “exit” or an “escape” is something that moves away for ‘efferent’, and “arrive” for ‘afferent’."
"Alternatively, an efferent signal is something that has an effect on the outside world, while an afferent signal affects the person. Anatomically, the CNS consists of two organs, the brain and the spinal cord. The brain is the main organ where movement originates, where thoughts and plans develop, and where consciousness is housed."
"The brain is what pushes us to act on our drives and desires, where language begins, and where memories are stored. The intact adult brain weighs about 1. 5 kg , which is barely 2% of total body weight."
"Despite this relatively small size, it is extremely power hungry, and uses up about one-fifth of the body’s total energy expenditure. When talking about parts of the brain, it is helpful to have a set of directional terms that can describe the location of various anatomical structures unambiguously. Familiarity with the terminology used to describe location and relationships within the nervous system is critical as we move forward into examining brain systems."
"Directional terms are used to locate one structure, usually in relation to another structure. Some terms, like dorsal or ventral, are relative to the axis of the central nervous system, so the direction these terms define changes if used for brain regions versus other body regions. Other terms, like superior or inferior, keep their meaning across the entire body."
"Anterior: In front of; toward the face Posterior: Behind; toward the back Superior: Above; toward the head Inferior: Below; toward the feet Medial: Toward the middle Lateral: Toward the edge Dorsal: Toward the top of the brain or the back of the spinal cord Ventral: Toward the bottom of the brain or the front of the spinal cord Rostral: Toward the front of the brain or the top of the spinal cord Caudal: Toward the back of the brain or the bottom of the spinal cord Often anterior and rostral are used interchangeably and posterior and caudal are used interchangeably. Neuroanatomists use all of these terms to describe the relationship of one structure to another. For example, we’ll see in Chapter 22 that introduces the four lobes of the brain, the frontal lobe is anterior or rostral to the parietal lobe, and the parietal lobe is dorsal to the temporal lobe."
"These anatomical words can also be combined to subdivide complex brain regions. For example, a structure called the thalamus has many small subsections, such as the dorsomedial nucleus or the ventropostero-lateral nucleus. Naming structures with this anatomical language is useful in identifying where they are located in a brain scan or autopsy, but these words tell us nothing about function."
"As a three-dimensional structure, the brain can be sectioned, or cut, for visualization or analysis in several ways. Here, we will describe the three main orientations, each at right angles to the others. The frontal or coronal plane is a vertical plane in a medial to lateral direction, dividing objects into front and back pieces."
"The sagittal plane is also a vertical plane but in a rostral-caudal direction, meaning it divides objects into right and left regions. Finally, the horizontal plane divides objects into top and bottom regions. In a sliced section of the brain, you might notice that brain tissue has different colored areas."
"Some brain tissue is pale and almost white, and these areas are described as white matter. Generally, white matter represents pathways of communication. White matter regions are comprised of axons."
"It appears white due to the myelin sheath on the axons. Other sections of brain tissue have a darker pink/gray color, appropriately called gray matter. These areas are usually dense with cell bodies and dendrites."
"Gray matter is the location of most synapses. The brain has two very similar halves, the left and right hemisphere. Oftentimes, in the neurotypical individual, information passes between both hemispheres rapidly: what one hemisphere senses or learns, so does the other hemisphere."
"It is the white matter tracts that allow for this transfer of information. When a white matter pathway crosses from one side of the body to another, we call it a decussation. Commissures are white matter tracts that connect gray matter between the left and right hemispheres of the brain."
The main commissure that allows for the passage of information between the two hemispheres is called the corpus callosum. Association fibers are white matter tracts that connect different bits of gray matter within the same hemisphere of the brain. These connections do not cross the midline.
"Projection fibers are white matter tracts that connect the hemispheres of the brain with lower brain structures or with the spinal cord. They “project” from the cortex to the lower brain structures or spinal cord. In the following chapters, some of the many structures that make up the brain will be introduced."
"To begin this discussion, we will identify some of the basic development of the nervous system to understand how different areas of the brain are organized. Very early in development, an embryo looks like a flat disc with 3 different layers of cells. Endoderm: will eventually develop into the viscera  Mesoderm: will eventually develop into the bones and muscles Ectoderm: will eventually develop in the nervous system and the skin Let’s focus on the ectoderm that will develop into the nervous system."
"The ectoderm layer will fold together in a process called neurulation to form a neural tube. Neurulation  occurs within the first month following conception in humans. During neurulation, the middle of the neural plate folds first, followed by the anterior and posterior ends."
"The central nervous system will develop from the walls of the neural tube and the hollow lumen of the tube will become the cerebral ventricles and spinal canal within the central nervous system. Early in pregnancy, there can be problems with the process of neurulation and the formation and closure of the neural tube. Collectively, these are referred to as neural tube defects that include defects that occur within the brain, spine, or spinal cord."
"One of the more common neural tube defects is spina bifida. In spina bifida, the neural tube fails to close completely, and as a result the backbone that typically protects the spinal cord also does not form appropriately. This event can occur anywhere along the spine, and will typically result in nerve damage at that particular site that will potentially lead to physical and / or intellectual disability ranging in severity with the degree of damage."
"Anencephaly is a neural tube defect that is caused by the failure of the anterior portion of the neural tube to close. Anencephaly is a serious birth defect that typically prevents the development of the anterior portion of the brain and associated skull. Unfortunately, many neural tube defects occur very early in pregnancy, such that many women do not yet know that they are pregnant."
"As a result, daily folic acid supplements or a diet that includes foods rich in folate is recommended to all women of reproductive age to help prevent neural tube defects in the event of a pregnancy. Early in development, the anterior portion of the neural tube has three distinct vesicles, which will each develop into different structures. These vesicles, from most anterior to most posterior, are the prosencephalon , the mesencephalon , and the rhombencephalon ."
"Through development, the walls of these vesicles will differentiate into adult brain structures. Differentiation is the process by which structures become more complex and functionally specialized during development. The names of these early vesicles can be used to describe either the stages through development, or a grouping of structures that eventually form in adulthood."
"In the following chapters, we will learn more about some of these anatomical structures. The prosencephalon, or the forebrain, is most anterior in the neural tube and eventually develops into the “higher order” brain regions, including the cerebral cortex. Most of the time, when you see an image of an intact brain from the side or the top, the structures that are visible to you are the forebrain structures."
"The prosencephalon is made up of the telencephalon and the diencephalon. As the prosencephalon continues to develop, additional structures will form that are associated with the cerebral hemispheres. For instance, the optic vesicles that bud off the surface of the prosencephalon will differentiate into the retinas of the eyes—thus, the retina is made up of neural tissue."
"The olfactory bulbs will differentiate from the ventral surface of the cerebral hemispheres. Note that as the walls of the tube develop into these structures, the lumen of the tube remains and will become the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain. The lateral ventricles will form from the tube within the cerebral hemispheres and the third ventricle will be found ventrally surrounded by the diencephalon."
"The cerebral cortex makes up the outermost layer of the brain. The word “cortex” comes from the word meaning “bark”, the outer layer of a tree. The cerebral cortex is the most evolved structure of the human brain and is responsible for higher order thinking."
"Here, the brain processes behaviors such as attention, memory, and language. The basal ganglia are made up of a series of brain structures  that are used for such behaviors as motor and habit learning, emotional processing, and action selection. The thalamus is often referred to as a “sensory relay station” in the brain, since almost every sensory modality  passes information through the thalamus before being directed to the appropriate area of the cortex."
The hypothalamus is also within the diencephalon. This structure serves as an autonomic control center to alter visceral function and a communication route to the body’s endocrine system through control of anterior pituitary hormones and production of posterior pituitary hormones. Neural signals originating in the hypothalamus have the capability to influence the chemistry and function of the entire body.
"The hypothalamus also has nuclei that function in emotional responses, and regulate body temperature, food intake, water balance, and sleep. Moving more caudally, the mesencephalon  differentiates into the tectum and the tegmentum. The tectum  is the dorsal portion of the midbrain and it has two major structures: the superior colliculus and inferior colliculus."
The superior colliculus is important in reflexive eye movements that allow you to quickly orient to something changing in your environment. The inferior colliculus relays auditory information to the thalamus for auditory function. The tegmentum  is the ventral portion of the midbrain.
"There are many structures in the tegmentum and they can perform a wide variety of functions. For example, the periaqueductal gray allows us to respond to painful stimuli, the red nucleus and substantia nigra coordinate complex movements, and the ventral tegmental area is important for the processing of reward and motivation. The most posterior/caudal portion of the neural tube is the rhombencephalon ."
"Evolutionarily speaking, the rhombencephalon represents the oldest part of the central nervous system. These structures likely evolved some 570 million years ago. The more rostral portion of the hindbrain differentiates into two structures: the cerebellum and the pons."
"The cerebellum, or “little brain”, is best known as a structure that enables motor control functions, such as balance, coordination, posture, and learning physical actions. The cerebellum helps us recognize and predict sequences of events during motor learning. More recently, the cerebellum has also been recognized to play a role in non-motor functions like learning."
The pons  is an important structure that relays impulses between the motor cortex and the cerebellum. It has a critical function to help us perform involuntary functions like breathing. The caudal portion of the hindbrain differentiates into the medulla.
"The medulla is found at the far posterior end of these three early developmental vesicles. The medulla contains many clumps of neurons that are responsible for functions that an organism carries out unconsciously. It contains a cardiovascular center that is especially important in maintaining and changing blood pressure and heart rate, and also has connections to the pons to help regulate breathing."
"The medulla contains areas that can detect toxins in the blood that come from dietary sources, triggering vomiting. Other behaviors like hiccupping, swallowing, coughing, and sneezing are also controlled by the medulla. Moving beyond this anterior portion of the neural tube that contains the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, the neural tube continues down the length of the embryo."
"The remainder of the neural tube will differentiate into the spinal cord, with the lumen of the tube becoming the central canal of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is important in relaying information to and from the body. The brain is comprised of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem."
The cerebrum is the most prominent region of the brain. It is divided into left and right hemispheres. The hemispheres have many of the same functions.
"For example, each perceives touch on one side of the body, but some functions demonstrate laterality, meaning they are primarily controlled on one side of the brain. Most of what we think of when we imagine the brain is the cerebral cortex in humans. The cortex has many folds to increase the surface area of the brain."
"The bumps or raised ridges on the outer surface are called gyri  and the grooved indentations are called sulci . A large, deep sulcus is sometimes also called a fissure. Although each gyrus and sulcus has a name that either identifies its function or location, there are only three sulci that we will introduce here to help orient us around the neuroanatomical features of the cortex."
"The longitudinal fissure is the most obvious fissure in the brain. It divides the two hemispheres, running along the anterior–posterior axis, visible from a dorsal view of the brain. If you were to cut along the longitudinal fissure completely, you would get two symmetrical portions of brain: the left and right hemispheres."
"The central sulcus is a large fissure that starts at the dorsal part of the brain at about the halfway point on the anterior–posterior axis. In a sagittal view, the central sulcus runs ventrally about half the length of the brain. The other groove worth noting is the lateral fissure."
"This one runs roughly along the anterior-to-posterior direction, and curves gently dorsally. Again, in a sagittal view, it is roughly seen in the middle third of the brain in the anterior–posterior axis. The cortex is roughly divided into four major lobes, which are named after the bones of the skull that surround each section of brain."
"The lobes are paired, meaning that the whole brain contains two of each, a left and a right. In general, the structures are roughly symmetrical. The frontal lobes are the most rostral, located in the front of the brain."
"The posterior border of the frontal lobe is the central sulcus. Among mammals, it is the largest of the four lobes. The frontal lobes are responsible for higher level executive functions like attention, critical thinking, and impulse control."
"The frontal lobes allows us to do mental math, to hold a string of letters in our head to be repeated backward, and to suppress socially unacceptable actions. Our personality is influenced by the frontal lobe. An injury to these brain structures can result in a radical change in a person’s behavior."
"They are the last brain region to fully develop, not completing development until individuals reach their mid 20s. The frontal lobes are also the location of the primary motor cortex, the region of the brain responsible for planning and executing movement. Specifically, the primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus, which is directly anterior to the central sulcus."
"Phineas Gage, who was mentioned back in Chapter 1, is one of the most famous case studies in neuroscience. The mid-1800s saw an expansion of industry in the United States. The most reliable and quickest way to move goods and people was with the railways that were starting to zig-zag across the growing country."
"The factor slowing down railway expansion was terrain: land had to be relatively flat for the tracks to be laid down. Terraforming mountains was a dangerous ordeal, and in the years before TNT  was developed, work accidents were a risk that these demolition workers faced. Phineas Gage was one of those workers."
"In the green mountain hills of Vermont, Gage was putting explosive powder into a crack in a mountain to clear land for a new railway. As Gage packed the explosive using a three-foot-long metal rod, a spark accidentally ignited the blast prematurely, causing the tamping iron to rocket cleanly through Gage’s skull. Miraculously, Gage survived the blast."
"Within a month, he had made an almost complete recovery. Gage was talking excitedly with his doctors, he was eating voraciously, and even reported experiencing no pain. While the doctors noticed that his entire frontal lobe had been destroyed, it was his friends who noticed the dramatic change in his personality: whereas he was once a friendly man, adored and respected by his coworkers, the new Gage was irreverent, generally unlikable, and prone to using profanity at the most inappropriate times."
"The pre-injury Gage was a shrewd businessman who followed through with his plans, but Gage now was unreliable and at times, acted in a more like an animal. Because of the injuries to his frontal lobe, his friends described him as being “no longer Gage”. The central sulcus lies caudal to the frontal lobe and divides the frontal lobes from the parietal lobes."
"The primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe and is responsible for the perception of touch and pain. With our skin, we are able to detect light touch, temperature, pain, vibration, and many other modalities. This ability to sense different tactile properties of things in the world around us with our body is one of the major functions of the parietal lobe."
"Another closely related sense, proprioception , is also processed by neurons of the parietal lobe. The parietal lobes also perform higher-level visual processing. The temporal lobes are located on the side of the brain, separated from the frontal and parietal lobes by the lateral fissure."
"Like the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe plays a role in sensory processing, specifically with hearing, smell, taste, and higher-level visual processing. The auditory system allows our brain to interpret sound waves. The ability to remember important facts depends on memory-related processes."
"These functions are carried out in part by a brain structure called the hippocampus, which is buried medially and ventrally in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe also houses some structures that are important for language. The occipital lobes, the most caudal lobes, are located in the back of the brain."
"Anatomically, there is not an obvious border that separates the occipital lobe from adjacent areas of the cortex. The occipital lobe is the smallest of the four lobes. The main function of the occipital lobe is for processing of visual stimuli."
"Our eyes are capable of capturing light and converting that light into signals. The primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe, also called V1, interprets those signals into a representation of the visual world. Other vision-related stimuli, such as objects in motion, object orientation, and color are also processed by neurons in the occipital lobe."
"The cerebellum lies inferior to the occipital lobes. The cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres like the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum is best known for its role in regulation and control of movement, but it is also involved in cognitive functions like emotions."
"The brainstem is located between the cerebrum and the spinal cord. It is important for regulating critical functions like heart rate, breathing, and sleep. It is also the location of most of the cranial nerves."
"The spinal cord, which is part of the central nervous system but not part of the brain, is responsible for receiving sensory information from the body and sending motor information to the body. Involuntary motor reflexes are also a function of the spinal cord, indicating that the spinal cord can process information independently from the brain. Viewing the brain from above shows the bilateral symmetry of the left and right cerebral hemispheres, which are separated by the longitudinal fissure."
"The frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes can be seen. Similar to the lateral view, the central sulcus divides the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. The precentral gyrus—which is the location of the primary motor cortex—sits rostral to the central sulcus, whereas the postcentral gyrus—which is the location of the primary somatosensory cortex—lies caudal to the central sulcus."
"Underneath the brain, the frontal and temporal lobes are visible, as is the cerebellum. Like the dorsal view, the longitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum into right and left hemispheres. The pons and medulla  connect the cerebrum to the spinal cord."
"Cranial nerves are also visible on the ventral surface of the brain. The olfactory tract leads out to the olfactory bulb, which connects to the olfactory nerve. The optic tract crosses the midline at the optic chiasm, and then the optic nerve projects to the retina."
Other cranial nerves enter or leave the brain at the level of the brainstem. The hypothalamus is located caudal to the pons and the mammillary bodies project out from the hypothalamus. A mid-sagittal section slices the brain through the longitudinal fissure and separates the right hemisphere from the left.
"It also reveals more structures. In a mid-sagittal view, all four cortical lobes are visible. The frontal lobe is separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus, the occipital lobe is in the posterior region of the brain, and the temporal lobe can be seen behind the brainstem."
"The cerebellum, pons, medulla, and spinal cord are seen caudal to the cerebrum, but in this view, the midbrain—which is made up of two regions: the tegmentum and tectum—is also visible superior to the pons. The corpus callosum is located in the center of the cerebrum and is a white matter bundle made up of axons crossing from one hemisphere to the other. Surrounding the corpus callosum is the cingulate gyrus, a region important for emotion."
"The diencephalon region of the brain consists of the region around the thalamus and hypothalamus. It is located inferior to the fornix and lateral ventricle, posterior to the anterior commissure, and superior to the brainstem. The fornix is a nerve fiber bundle containing primarily output from the hippocampus."
"The anterior commissure sits above the hypothalamus and is a white matter tract  that allows information to cross from one hemisphere to the other. The thalamus is best known for its role as a relay and processing location for the sensory and motor systems. The hypothalamus has a variety of functions including control of stress and the “fight or flight” response of the autonomic nervous system, reproduction, sleep, thirst, hunger, and other homeostatic functions."
"The mamillary bodies sit in the posterior part of the hypothalamus and are important for memory. The optic nerves from the retina cross at the optic chiasm and then the optic tracts continue back into the diencephalon. In the brainstem, the tectum of the midbrain consists of the superior and inferior colliculi, which are important for vision and hearing, respectively."
"Finally, the reticular formation is located throughout the brainstem. Networks within the reticular formation are important for regulating sleep and consciousness, pain, and motor control. Coronal sections of the brain allow deep tissue structures to be visible."
"A cut through the anterior portion of the temporal lobe shows the amygdala, a region important for emotion, located in the medial temporal lobe. The regions of the basal ganglia are also visible: the striatum  and the globus pallidus. The basal ganglia has multiple functions, but is best known for its role in regulation of movement."
"The lateral ventricle sits medial to the basal ganglia and below the corpus callosum. The third ventricle is located in the middle of the brain, inferior to the lateral ventricle. The longitudinal fissure separates the left and right cerebral hemispheres and the lateral sulcus is the border between the frontal and temporal lobes."
"A coronal section taken closer to the central sulcus will make the hippocampus visible. The hippocampus is known for its role in memory and spatial awareness. At this location, the basal ganglia is more defined; the caudate and putamen are still present, but the two separate regions of the globus pallidus  can be seen, as well as the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra."
The thalamus is located on either side of the third ventricle. The corpus callosum is superior to the lateral ventricle. The cerebrum is divided in half by the longitudinal fissure and the lateral sulcus separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes.
"Although we mostly think about the neurons that make up the brain and spinal cord as being the main characters of the nervous system, there are many other anatomical features that play important supporting roles. These are often non-neuronal structures that are still critically important in allowing the nervous system to do what it needs to do. The brain is a soft and delicate internal organ housed inside the skull."
"If there weren’t some protective buffer separating the soft brain matter from the rigid bone, the jelly-like brain would be smashed up against the inside of the skull and get injured as the head moves around. The meninges are a series of protective membranes that minimize this kind of damage. They surround the brain and extend all the way down the spinal cord."
"Think of the meninges as an organic type of “bubble wrap” that encases a fragile nervous system. There are three types of membranes that collectively make up the meninges. From the outermost to innermost layer, they are:  Dura mater."
"The dura is made of thick, fibrous material and can get to be 0. 8 mm thick in the adult body . The dura mater is physically attached to the inside of the skull with highly resilient connections found at the sutures between the plates of the cranium."
The name originates from Latin meaning “tough mother”. Arachnoid mater. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges.
"The fibers are very delicate and resemble a spider web, which is where the name comes from. Within this space, there are protrusions that allow for CSF to drain into sinuses, which allow for recycling of soluble substances. Most of the CSF in the brain exists underneath this layer in the subarachnoid space."
"Pia mater. The pia mater is the third layer of the meninges. It is very fragile, is in direct contact with the surface of the brain, and closely follows the sulci and gyri."
The name means “pious mother”. Inflammation of the meninges is a potentially deadly condition called meningitis. Exposure to infectious agents like viruses or bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis  is a common cause of the inflammation.
"When the meninges are inflamed, the brain gets compressed from all sides, increasing intracranial pressure, producing many of the same symptoms seen in hydrocephalus: fever, stiff neck, headache, seizures, and altered mental status. The N. meningitidis bacteria and the viruses are highly transmissible in close contact, but vaccinations are highly effective at minimizing the infection rate."
"As with bacterial infections, broad-spectrum antibiotics are effective at treating the infection. Like every other organ in the body, the brain requires oxygen and nutrients to function. In humans, this function is accomplished by the blood that is pumped around the body using a network of blood vessels called the circulatory system."
"The brain has a very high demand for oxygen and nutrients: at only 2% of total body weight, it receives about 15% of total cardiac output. Stroke is an extremely common, life-threatening medical condition that results in a loss of blood flow to the brain. According to 2016 statistics from the World Health Organization, stroke is the second-highest cause of death worldwide."
"The number one risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. There are two common types of strokes that a person may experience. More than 80% of all strokes are ischemic strokes , which happens when normal blood flow is interrupted, causing cell death by deprivation of oxygen and nutrients to brain tissue."
"Generally, this type of injury can happen when a blood clot forms, travels through the circulatory system, and gets lodged in a tiny brain blood vessel, thus, blocking the passage of blood. The other 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes, which result from a burst blood vessel that causes bleeding into the brain. The presence of uncontrolled blood inside the brain causes an increase in intracranial pressure, which can be lethal."
"Many brain cells may die since they cannot take up oxygen directly from the blood. Additionally, blood has dramatically different properties than the normal solution brain cells live in, and this can cause the neurons to trigger a self-destruction program. Generally, hemorrhagic stroke is more deadly than ischemic stroke."
"Because the different blood vessels of the brain’s circulatory system are responsible for providing blood to specific areas of the brain, it is possible to diagnose the specific area where the stroke is happening based on the presentation of symptoms. For example, if the middle cerebral artery blood is occluded by an ischemic stroke, the left hemisphere motor cortex will lose blood flow. Because of the contralateral organization of the descending motor pathway, the patient may therefore present with paralysis or weakness in the right half of the body."
"It is vitally important to correctly diagnose and differentiate between the two types of strokes. An ischemic stroke may be treated with injection of a “clot-busting” drug, a substance that helps the body break down the offending blockage. However, these clot-busters could make the bleeding from a hemorrhagic stroke even worse."
"It is important for oxygen and nutrients to pass from the blood into the brain tissue. Small blood vessels outside of the brain, such as the capillaries in the fingertips, have very thin walls—sometimes the width of a single cell—and are, therefore, highly permeable to gases. These vessels can either contain tiny holes or large protein structures that physically transport substances across the blood vessel."
"On the other hand, it is also advantageous to separate toxins and foreign pathogens in the bloodstream from getting into brain tissue. The blood–brain barrier  is an anatomical adaptation that selectively transports substances necessary for normal biological function, while simultaneously excluding potentially harmful invaders from the brain. The BBB physically surrounds blood vessels in the brain."
"It is made up of endothelial cells and a type of glial cell called an astrocyte. The BBB is injured in a variety of medical disorders, ranging from stroke, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease, just to name a few. It is still unknown what role the disruption of the BBB plays in brain disorders."
"The exclusive nature of the BBB can be a double-edged sword. It is difficult to deliver a drug into the brain from the blood stream if that drug is unable to pass through the BBB. For example, the current gold standard pharmaceutical treatment for Parkinson’s disease is to increase the brain’s levels of dopamine."
"However, dopamine does not pass through the BBB. To get around this, physicians give the BBB-permeable substance L-DOPA, which the brain is able to convert into dopamine. Many other therapeutic drugs do not cross the BBB, so researchers are developing methods using electromagnetic fields to temporarily weaken the barrier, or surround the drugs in nanoparticles so small that the body cannot identify them as foreign."
"There are hollow spaces within the brain called ventricles. The human brain has a total of four ventricles. The two very large, paired ventricles  are the lateral ventricles."
"They are connected medially to the third ventricle, which extends to the posterior aspect of the brain. From here, the cerebral aqueduct that runs ventrally extends into the fourth ventricle before continuing into the central canal: a narrow space that runs all the way through the length of the spinal cord along the midline. The entire ventricular system is interconnected."
"The ventricles are filled with a liquid called cerebrospinal fluid . CSF is basically a high-salt water solution. Because of the high osmolarity of CSF, it is a very buoyant solution."
"Like a fully grown person who can float easily on the surface of the extremely salty Dead Sea, CSF allows the brain to remain “floating” inside the skull. Without CSF, the brain weighs almost 1. 5 kg ."
"Cells and blood vessels at the ventral base of the brain would be crushed under the weight of the brain itself. But when the brain is surrounded by CSF, it weighs less than 50 grams, almost two orders of magnitude lighter!  CSF is also found within the meninges that encase the brain. In fact, more than 80% of the CSF in the body exists in this space outside the brain."
"This liquid serves as a form of “cushioning” that protects the brain from rapid head movements. If it weren’t for this physical protection, the inertia of head movement may cause your brain to smash against the inside of the rigid skull if you move your head too quickly. The CSF layer allows the head to withstand some sloshing of the brain, but a movement that is too abrupt can cause a traumatic brain injury."
"CSF can also function as a way to wash impurities out of the brain. The volume of CSF in the typical human body is about 150 mL, a little more than half a cup. Because there is frequent turnover of CSF, the material gets absorbed back into the body regularly."
"Each day, the body produces about half a liter of CSF, so the brain cycles through the entire volume a few times. Hydrocephalus, historically called “water on the brain”, is a common condition affecting the brain of about 1 in 200 newborns and a small number of adults. In patients with hydrocephalus, the volume of CSF increases, which elevates intracranial pressure, causing symptoms such as fever, stiff neck, headache, seizures, or altered mental status."
"In adults, the skull is rigid and unmoving. But in newborns with hydrocephalus, the plates of the skull are not completely fused together. Often, these children will have a bulging parts on the skull and an expansion of the forehead."
"Increased CSF volume can happen in a couple ways. The clearance of CSF may fail while production remains normal, or the entrance to the central canal in the spinal cord may be narrowed or blocked by a tumor, leading to an increase in the volume in the brain. A common treatment for hydrocephalus is to surgically implant a shunt  that allows for drainage, thus decreasing intracranial pressure."
The earliest methods of analyzing nervous system anatomy were crude: manual dissection of the brain post-mortem . The techniques discussed below were developed to allow scientists to see some aspect of the anatomy of the nervous system—either gross anatomical differences or connectivity. Additional techniques were developed to see how the living brain functions.
The following techniques are used to analyze brain structure. “Does the patient have a brain tumor and where is the brain tumor located? ”  “Are the meninges intact?
"”  The CT scan relies on X-ray technology. X-rays are high energy beams of electromagnetic radiation that are capable of passing through many physical objects. Traditional two-dimensional X-rays, such as those used to image a broken bone or tooth decay, use radiographic film to detect where the X-rays get blocked."
"When an X-ray passes unimpeded, it causes the film to darken. But, wherever the X-rays are blocked, the film remains white. Therefore, material that is more dense  appears as white, less dense material  appears dark."
"Other tissue are some shade of gray in between. The CT scan is essentially a three-dimensional X-ray that revolves around the person as they move through the scanner. Instead of using radiographic film, the CT scan uses a computer that detects the passage of X-rays, located directly across the emission source of the X-ray."
"Instead of a flat, two dimensional-image, the CT scan uses an X-ray gun that revolves around the person’s body as they advance slowly through a large circular hole. The computer is then able to compile the series of two-dimensional images and turn them into a three-dimensional reconstruction that can be used to see the brain from any projection. CT scans give us a spatial resolution of about 0."
"5 mm. CT scans are generally used clinically to assess diagnostic changes over several days , so temporal resolution is not a major consideration. As an anatomical analysis that can easily identify tissues of different density, it is great for identifying and diagnosing particular brain conditions."
"Brain tumors can be visualized in a CT scan, since they are identified by an increase in tissue density compared to normal brain tissue. Hydrocephalus, an abnormal and potentially deadly expansion of the CSF-filled ventricles, can be quickly identified by this analysis. Meningitis, an inflammation of the meninges, may present as increased contrast in the CT scan."
"The big advantage of the CT scan is that it is noninvasive. You can use a CT scan in order to diagnose and identify the cause of a condition while a person is still alive, and hopefully work towards developing an intervention. It is also a relatively quick technique."
"A full-head CT scan takes only minutes, which allows for a rapid diagnosis of anatomical structures. However, X-rays are highly mutagenic. Prolonged exposure to X-rays dramatically increases the risk of developing various cancers, since X-rays interfere with the process of DNA replication."
"It is estimated that the radiation exposure in a single head CT scan is similar to the background exposure of X-rays in a few months. When a CT scan is prescribed, the diagnostic information gained from a CT scan is more important than the risks from increased radiation exposure. Example questions answered:  “Are their structural abnormalities in a brain structure?"
”  “What are the measurements of a brain structure? ”  Magnetic resonance imaging  is used for imaging brain structures. An MRI is able to more clearly differentiate between different types of tissues with high resolution.
"It can be used in place of CT scan for visualization of structures that are very small or need finer detail than can be seen with a CT scan. The MRI machine is a circular tunnel through which a person on a table moves. As the person moves through the scanner, an extremely powerful magnet revolves around their head."
"The power of a typical magnet used in a hospital MRI may be as powerful as 10,000 gauss —strong enough to lift a car. The more powerful fMRI machines can be as powerful as 100,000 gauss . The stronger the magnets, the better the spatial resolution that the machine can produce ."
"MRI technology detects and quantifies the movement of water molecules, which moves differently in gray matter than white matter. The movement of a water molecule in biological tissue is not completely random, largely because the brain is made up of heterogeneous tissue. Although the technique has a great capacity for analyzing brain structure, the nature of the machine itself presents limitations."
"The machine can also be very loud, which is not trivial if you are interested in using this technology on younger patients. The use of a tremendously powerful magnetic field presents a different set of limitations. At the risk of severe injury or death, the patient entering the scanner cannot have any magnetosensitive implants, such as metallic aneurism clips, intrauterine devices, or shrapnel."
Even older generation tattoos have trace amounts of metal that cause burns when exposed to the magnets of the MRI machine. “Is the volume of the white matter tract medial longitudinal fasciculus important for normal language processing? ”  “Does spinal cord compression cause neurological deficits?
"”  While a CT scan is great for detecting gross anatomical anomalies like tumors or intracranial bleeding, it has a difficult time with subtle anatomical changes like differences between gray matter and white matter tracts. A technique for identifying these differences was proposed in 1994, called diffusion tensor imaging . DTI quantifies white matter because of the morphological features of white matter."
"More specifically, DTI uses MRI technology to detect and quantify the movement of water molecules, which move differently in gray matter than white matter. The movement of a water molecule in biological tissue is not completely random, largely because the brain is made up of heterogeneous tissue. White matter is very different from gray matter."
"A water molecule is more easily able to diffuse along the same direction as a tract of white matter but has a difficult time moving perpendicularly across such tissue. When looking at DTI images, they will have coloring added to the figure to show the different white matter tracts. Axonal projections are directional, with the soma at one end and the axon terminal at the other."
One of the shortcomings of DTI is that it cannot give us information about the directionality of the axonal projections. The following techniques are used to study brain function. Example questions answered:  “Which areas of the brain decrease in activity when a person experiences mild cognitive impairment?
"”  “Do drug-dependent people have a high density of opioid receptors? ”  The positron emission tomography  scan is an application of nuclear medicine best known for its applications in the medical setting for the diagnosis of cancer. Before the PET scan, a radioactive compound called a tracer is injected into the bloodstream."
"The PET scanner itself is a large circular device that looks similar to the CT scanner. The tracer is chemically unstable, and it produces a signal within the body that can be detected by the PET scanner as the person moves through the machine. A common tracer is a radioactive analog of glucose."
"Areas of the brain that are active will metabolize glucose for energy. Therefore, when an area of the brain increases in energetic demand, that change can be detected by identifying the increase in glucose movement. PET scans can be effective at diagnosing and identifying the location of tumors in the nervous system."
"It also provides an overall picture of brain activity, which may be useful in diagnosing disorders of cognitive deficits, like dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease. PET scans have also been used to image the activity of specific brain areas as a person performs behavioral tasks, but this use of PET scan has largely been replaced by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Another application of PET scanning is to visualize levels of receptors in vivo."
"When looking at PET images, they will have coloring added to the figure to show where, anatomically, activity in the brain has increased or decreased. By convention, many times an increase in brain activity is depicted with warm colors  whereas a decrease in brain activity is depicted with cool colors . The downside of the PET scan as a diagnostic tool is similar to a limitation of the CT scan."
"A person is exposed to radioactive compounds and gamma wave radiation, which are potentially mutagenic. In images produced by a PET scan, it is often difficult to identify boundaries between tissue, even between dramatically different internal organs. To make up for this deficit, PET scans are frequently performed simultaneously with an anatomical analysis like a CT scan."
PET scans generally have very poor spatial and temporal resolution. Example questions answered:  “Do neurons in the right hemisphere cingulate gyrus increase in activity when a person sees their loved ones? ”  “Which areas of the brain change in activity when a person is planning a motor action?
"”  The functional magnetic resonance imaging  technique is probably the most well-known method of studying brain activity. Because fMRI can be performed while a person is engaged in a task, many research studies use fMRI as a means to correlate behavior with activity patterns in specific parts of the brain. fMRI measures differences in blood flow and oxygen levels."
"Like the PET scan, the fMRI hinges on the idea that more active areas of the brain have different metabolic demands than less active areas of the brain. When there is more activity in one area of the brain, the neurons in that area need more oxygen. This change in blood flow is detected by the fMRI."
"The main reason fMRI is useful in so many research applications is that you are able to visualize brain activity real-time during the performance of complex behavioral tasks. You can present specific visual stimuli to a person in an fMRI scan and evaluate which parts of the brain change in activity. For example, seeing pictures of faces causes increased blood flow into the fusiform face area."
"You can ask a person to perform a gambling task and evaluate the areas of the prefrontal lobe that are responsive to risk taking. When looking at fMRI images, they will have coloring added to the figure to show anatomically where activity in the brain has increased or decreased. By convention, many times an increase in brain activity is depicted with warm colors  whereas a decrease in brain activity is depicted with cool colors ."
"The limitations introduced with MRI earlier are the same for fMRI. In addition, due to the small tube, it can be difficult to study anxiety with endangering the patient. Further, the data collected by fMRI can be very difficult to analyze and are frequently subject to false positives."
"fMRI also assumes that increased blood flow is directly correlated with the amount of neural activity, which may not always be the case. It is sometimes easy to think of neuroscience as a focused study of the brain: How does activity of the brain contribute to behavior? In what ways does the brain change in disease?"
"Why do the cells of the brain behave the way they do? The truth is there are many parts of the body that also fall under the broad study of neuroscience. For example, the automatic kneejerk reflex that a clinician examines when they tap on your patellar tendon is a test of the nervous system."
"The reflex is driven by sensory neurons that detect muscle stretch, motor neurons that cause the kicking response, and interneurons that prevent the opposing muscle from acting. We have neural circuits that provoke changes in the activity of our internal organs, from the beating of our heart to the digestion of food, and the study of these systems is certainly part of neuroscience as well. Moving posterior from the brainstem is the other organ of the central nervous system: a long, thin structure of nervous tissue called the spinal cord."
"It functions to carry information both upwards towards the brain and downwards towards the body’s other organs and muscles. It can also process sensations and form an appropriate motor response in the absence of brain input. The spinal cord begins at the base of the brainstem and runs down to the small of your back, giving it a length around 44 cm ."
"The spinal cord is housed within a series of bones, called the vertebral column. Although the spinal cord itself is continuous, it can be divided based on the overlying vertebrae. A combination of a letter and a number is used to identify each section of the spinal cord; the letter corresponds to the vertebral section and the number refers to the number of bones down from the previous section ."
"The diameter and shape of the spinal cord changes over the length of vertebral column, a result of the function of the spinal nerves. For example, the region where motor neurons are located  is larger in the cervical region of the spinal cord compared to other regions of the spinal cord with minimal motor output. Branching off from each section of the spinal cord are two pairs of nerves, the afferent  sensory nerve roots, which branch from the dorsal side of the spinal cord, and the efferent  motor nerve roots, which branch from the ventral side of the spinal cord."
"These two branches meet and extend away from the spinal cord. After merging, they are called the spinal nerves. The vertebral column is divided into four main regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral."
"The spinal cord and spinal nerves that enter and exit the vertebral column are divided into these regions as well. Moving from anterior  to posterior , the four regions of the spinal cord are:  Cervical. The cervical region corresponds to C1 through C7."
"Nerves that exit through the cervical region innervate the muscles in the neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. Afferent nerves detect somatosensory inputs from these same areas. Sections C3 through C5 innervate the diaphragm, so an injury at this level or higher can quickly lead to death since the person may stop breathing."
"The spinal cord is at the widest diameter at the cervical area, as it has a swelling that corresponds to the many inputs and outputs to the arms. Thoracic. The thoracic region corresponds to T1 through T12."
"These regions innervate the middle trunk area, the intercostal muscles between the ribs, and abdominal muscles. Branches of the spinal nerves in the thoracic areas are responsible for changing the activity of the various internal organs during a fight-or-flight response . Lumbar."
"The lumbar region corresponds to L1 through L5. These pathways carry motor command information to the hips, thighs, and knees. Afferent lumbar inputs detect sensory information from the ventral side of the legs, such as the top of the thigh or the shin bone."
"As in the cervical region, the lumbar region has a swelling that increases the diameter of this section of spinal cord compared to the thoracic or sacral areas. Sacral. At the posterior-most end of the spinal cord is the sacral region, which corresponds to S1 through S5."
"Sacral spinal nerves control flexing of the toes. These nerves detect sensory information around the genital organs and the dorsal aspects of the legs, like the buttocks and the back of the thighs. There are also parasympathetic nerves that come from the sacral region and these innervate the colon, bladder, and genital organs ."
"Since information must pass through the anterior regions of the spinal cord to reach the posterior parts of the body, the more anterior an injury, the more parts of the body that are affected. From L2 through S5, the spinal cord exists as the cauda equina, meaning “horse’s tail” due to the appearance of the cord as individual nerves that branch from the main spinal cord. These nerves then innervate the pelvis area and lower limbs."
"This area of the spinal cord is where spinal tap and epidural procedures take place due to the decreased risk of spinal injury. The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, but the fibers that leave and enter the spinal cord are located in the peripheral nervous system. These spinal nerves can then extend to or from target tissues throughout the body."
"Nerves are collections of neuron axons found within the peripheral nervous system and can be classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves. The dorsal root is an example of a sensory  nerve that is responsible for carrying information toward the central nervous system. The ventral root is an example of a motor  nerve that is responsible for carrying information away from the central nervous system."
"Most nerves in the body are classified as mixed nerves that contain both sensory and motor fibers. Like the brain, the spinal cord is also made up of regions of white matter and gray matter. White matter regions are comprised of axons."
It appears white due to the myelin sheath on the axons. Gray matter regions are comprised of cell bodies and dendrites. Gray matter is the location of most synapses.
"In cross section, the gray matter of the spinal cord is found medially, and the white matter is found laterally. When referring to the spinal cord, we will typically use the directional terms “dorsal” and “ventral”. By convention, when looking a cross section of the spinal cord , the dorsal portion of the spinal cord will be located at the top of the image and the ventral portion of the spinal cord will be located at the bottom of the image."
"There are a few structures to be aware of when examining the spinal cord in cross section. The white matter in the spinal cord is divided into structures called columns because the axons in these regions are either ascending toward the brain or descending toward the appropriate spinal nerve. The dorsal column is on the dorsal or posterior side of the spinal cord, the ventral horn is on the ventral or anterior side of the spinal cord, and the lateral column lies between them."
"The gray matter is likewise divided into regions called horns. The dorsal horn is the location of sensory synapses, the ventral horn is the location of motor neuron cell bodies, and the lateral horn is the location of cell bodies of the autonomic nervous system. The dorsal root and ventral root consist of the axons of afferent  and efferent  fibers."
"They combine to form the spinal nerves. Sensory neuron cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglion, a gray matter region of the dorsal root. All somatosensory receptor neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion; a structure found just outside the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord."
"The receptor neurons  of the somatosensory system are bipolar neurons, meaning they have one process from the cell body that splits into two branches. Afferent fibers coming from the periphery through the spinal nerves enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglion."
The axons continue into the spinal cord and typically synapse in the dorsal horn. Interneurons are very short neurons that are a communication link between cell types in the spinal cord. They can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on their role.
They can also cross the midline of the spinal cord. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles are located in the ventral horn. The efferent axons of these neurons leave the spinal cord via the ventral root and then enter the spinal nerve on their way to their target tissue.
"The ventral portion of the spinal cord is concerned with motor output, or efferent signals. Muscle fibers are innervated by alpha motor neurons that have their cell bodies in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons leave the spinal cord via the ventral roots and travel to the muscle via efferent peripheral spinal nerves."
"In summary, sensory information is concerned with the dorsal portion of the spinal cord whereas motor information is concerned with the ventral portion of the spinal cord. The Peripheral Nervous System  functions as the intermediary between the central nervous system  and the rest of the body, including the skin, internal organs, and muscles of our limbs. The PNS can be divided into three main branches:  Somatic nervous system Autonomic nervous system Enteric nervous system In this chapter, the somatic and autonomic nervous systems will be compared and contrasted."
"An overview of the enteric nervous system will also be provided. The somatic and autonomic nervous system differ in their:  Target/effector organs Efferent pathways and the neurotransmitters that are used How the target/effector organ responds to the neurotransmitter The somatic nervous system represents all the parts of the PNS that are involved with the outside environment, either in sensing the environment or acting on it. For example, the nerves that detect pressure or pain on the foot are part of the afferent somatic nervous system."
We also think of the somatic nervous system as the branch that sends signals to our skeletal muscles. The nerves that innervate the muscles of the legs as we run are part of the efferent somatic nervous system. The somatic nervous system is also called the “voluntary nervous system” since it is used to cause muscle movement related to intentional actions.
"The somatic nervous system has an efferent path from the central nervous system to the target / effector organ that is made up of one neuron. The axon of this neuron is heavily myelinated, which allows for fast delivery of messages. This somatic motor neuron has its cell body in the central nervous system and has an axon that extends all the way to the target/effector organ, which—for the somatic nervous system—will be a skeletal muscle."
"All somatic motor neurons release the same neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, onto the skeletal muscle target/effector organ at the neuromuscular junction . The NMJ is one of the largest synapses in the body and one of the most well-studied because of its peripheral location. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released at the NMJ and it acts upon ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are present in postjunctional folds of the muscle fiber."
"Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and terminates its action, is present in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors allow for the influx of sodium ions into the muscle cell. The depolarization will cause nearby voltage-gated channels to open and fire an action potential in the muscle fiber."
"In a healthy system, an action potential in the motor neurons always causes an action potential in the muscle cell. The action potential leads to contraction of the muscle fiber. The autonomic nervous system encompasses all the branches of the peripheral nervous system that deal with the internal environment."
"As with the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system is comprised of nerves that detect the internal state as well as nerves that influence the internal organs. The body carries out all sorts of functions and responses unconsciously without any intentional control. It can do so by sending signals to smooth muscles and glands."
"The signals that cause us to sweat when it is hot, our pupils to dilate when it is dark, and our blood pressure to adjust when we stand up too quickly are all driven by the nerves of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has an efferent path from the central nervous system to the target/effector organ that is made up of a chain of two neurons with a ganglion in the middle. Recall that a ganglion is a collection of neuron cell bodies in the periphery."
"The neuron that has its cell body in the central nervous system is called the preganglionic neuron. The preganglionic cell axon is lightly myelinated and extends to a ganglion in the periphery where it synapses on the second neuron in the chain called the postganglionic neuron. The postganglionic neuron has its cell body in the ganglion and its unmyelinated axon extends from the ganglion to the target/effector organ, which for the autonomic nervous system will be: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands, or organs."
"The first synapse happens at the site of the ganglion. All preganglionic cells release acetylcholine onto the postganglionic cells. The acetylcholine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which results in the generation of an excitatory postsynaptic potential for the postganglionic cell body."
This effectively passes the message between the preganglionic and postganglionic cells. The second synapse occurs between the postganglionic cell and the target/effector organ. Postganglionic neurons in the autonomic nervous system release either norepinephrine or acetylcholine .
"These neurotransmitters can have either stimulatory or inhibitory activity at the target organs, dependent on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor that they bind to. Within the autonomic nervous system, synapses have a different structure than what is observed at the NMJ of the somatic nervous system. Instead, autonomic axons are highly branched and have enlarged varicosities that are spread along the axon."
"These varicosities contain synaptic vesicles that are filled with neurotransmitters. The varicosities form synapses ‘en passant’  with the target organ. These axon branches with varicosities drape over the cells of the target tissue, allowing a single axon branch to affect change over a greater area of the target tissue and better distribute autonomic activation at the target tissue."
"In summary, the somatic nervous system has a one neuron path that originates in the central nervous system. That neuron extends all the way to the skeletal muscle  where it releases acetylcholine. The acetylcholine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that cause EPSPs in the muscle fibers and giving a stimulatory effect."
"The autonomic nervous system  use a two neuron pathway between the CNS and the target tissues that are smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands, and organs. The sympathetic division consists of short presynaptic neurons that synapse on longer postsynaptic neurons in peripheral ganglia that are situated close to the spinal cord. The parasympathetic division consists of long presynaptic neurons that synapse on shorter postsynaptic neurons in peripheral ganglia that are situated close to the target organ."
"Like the somatic motor system, the primary neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic division is acetylcholine. In the sympathetic division, the preganglionic neuron releases acetylcholine, but the postganglionic neuron releases norepinephrine. The effects of these neurotransmitters at the target tissue can be either stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor."
"This information is summarized in the figure and table below. There are two branches of the autonomic nervous system, called the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, that typically have opposite effects at target tissues. Consider a scenario in which you encounter a bear on hike through Yellowstone National Park."
"Your heartrate would likely increase and your breathing rate would increase as you contemplate how to survive your encounter. This complex set of physiological reactions are due to activation of one of the branches of the autonomic nervous system: the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system mobilizes a set of physiological changes to a threat that is sometimes called the fight-or-flight response, which is activated when we are faced with a threat, either perceived or real."
"All of these rapid bodily responses result in the body preparing to attack or defend itself. Increased respiration allows the body to take in more oxygen, and dilation of blood vessels in the muscles allows that oxygen to get to the muscles, which is needed for muscle activation. Now, consider a completely opposite scenario."
"You’ve just eaten a large meal and you are spending the evening watching television on your couch. You would probably feel relaxed, satisfied, and more than a little sluggish. A different physiological response is happening, a behavior called the rest-and-digest response."
"These physiological changes are driven by the other main branch of the autonomic nervous system, called the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system are referred to as antagonistic. These branches are called ‘antagonistic’ because they typically have opposite effects at target tissues."
"There is dual innervation at many target organs of the autonomic nervous system. This means that target organs receive connections from both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. In a sense, this dual innervation provides both a ‘break’ and an ‘accelerator’ for changing the activity of our internal organs, offering a good amount of control."
"Both the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous systems influence the internal organs simultaneously. At all times, the heart is getting signals from the sympathetic nervous system which increase heart rate, and signals from the parasympathetic nervous system which decreases heart rate. However, this seesaw-like balance can shift quickly in either direction, such as inducing a sympathetic response if a fearful stimulus is encountered."
The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems differ anatomically as well. The sympathetic preganglionic neurons are short and the sympathetic postganglionic neurons are long. The parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are long and the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons are short.
"The cell bodies of the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system are located in the thoracic and lumbar sections of the spinal cord, so we can use thoracolumbar to describe the site of origin. The axons leave the central nervous system and travel only a short distance to the peripheral ganglion. In the sympathetic system, most of the ganglia are located along the spinal cord in the sympathetic paravertebral chain."
"A few sympathetic ganglia, called prevertebral, are located slightly more laterally. The preganglionic neurons synapse on the postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic ganglia. The postganglionic neurons then travel the rest of the distance to synapse on the target organs."
"One exception to this structure is the innervation of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal gland is a structure located at the top of each kidney. The gland has an outer portion called the cortex and an inner portion called the adrenal medulla, which is made up of cells called chromaffin cells."
The sympathetic preganglionic cell releases acetylcholine at the synapse with the chromaffin cells of the medulla and releases acetylcholine onto the chromaffin cell that is serving as a modified post-ganglionic neuron. Then the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla release epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. Within the bloodstream these neurotransmitters can act as hormones affecting change throughout the body leading to a rapid onset of sympathetic activity and sustained activation.
"The sympathetic preganglionic cell bodies are located in the intermediolateral cell columns in the lateral horn of the spinal cord, a gray matter region between the dorsal and ventral horns. The neurons send their axons out through the ventral root, and then can take one of multiple pathways. The axon can terminate in the paravertebral ganglion at the same spinal level as the cell body, or the axon can extend up or down the sympathetic chain to synapse on a postganglionic fiber at a different spinal level."
"Another possible pathway is to enter and exit the sympathetic chain without synapsing and continue on to terminate in a prevertebral ganglion located closer to the target organ. On the other hand, parasympathetic neurons originates predominantly in the cervical spinal cord , with some signals originating in the sacral areas . The parasympathetic nervous system usually receives signals from several cranial nerves."
"Cranial nerve X, also called the vagus nerve innervates multiple bodily organs in the midsection of the body. For the parasympathetic nervous system, the ganglia are located very close to the target tissues. Therefore, the preganglionic neuron must be very long to reach all the way to the ganglion to makes its first synapse."
"But due to the proximity of the ganglion to the target tissue, the postganglionic neuron is very short. We have already established that at the first synapse in the chain of autonomic neurons, all preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine, which binds to excitatory nicotinic receptors on the postganglionic neurons. This is true of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system."
"However, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system have different effects at target tissues because they use different neurotransmitters that produce either stimulatory or inhibitory effects at target tissues. The sympathetic postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine at target tissues. Norepinephrine  binds two major classes of adrenergic receptors: alpha adrenergic receptors and beta adrenergic receptors."
The effects of norepinephrine  can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the properties of the postsynaptic receptor. The parasympathetic postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine at target tissues. The target tissues express muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
"The effect of the acetylcholine can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the subtype of muscarinic  receptors. The location of function of these transmitters and receptors are critical for clinical use, for example, when treating high blood pressure or sexual dysfunction. Visceral functions are regulated through a number of autonomic reflexes, but they can be directly controlled by higher brain areas."
"Within the brain stem, the medulla most directly controls autonomic activity. The medulla receives most of its information via the vagus nerve . Within the medulla are a variety of control centers that regulate functions such as cardiovascular activity, respiratory rate, vomiting, and swallowing."
"The pons, another brain stem structure also serves as an autonomic control center for respiration. In addition to brain stem structures, there are also higher order brain areas that are important for autonomic control. The hypothalamus can directly regulate the medulla, and is also critical for the regulation of water balance, temperature control, and hunger."
"The Limbic System, made up of a number of structures including the the hippocampus and amygdala, functions in our expression of emotion. The limbic system structures are responsible for visceral responses associated with emotional states, including blushing, fainting, pallor, nervous cold sweats, racing heart rate, and uneasy feelings in the stomach. Further, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum also function in autonomic control."
"The cerebral cortex has been shown to regulate lower brain structures especially in autonomic control associated with emotion and personality. The cerebellum has connections to the medulla that are critical for the control of autonomic functions such as sweating and nausea. The internal organs that carry out digestive functions, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, are surrounded by a dense mesh of neurons that regulate their activity."
"Consisting of half a billion nerve cells, this net of neurons cause the digestive tract to increase or decrease the rate of these processes depending on the body’s demands The enteric nervous system receives signals from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and functions without our conscious knowledge. Historically, these digestive functions have been classified as part of the autonomic nervous system, but these responses do not share the same reflex pathway, and the enteric signals can work entirely independent of the vagus nerve, for example. Each sensory system is obviously quite different in the type of stimulation that it responds to and the manner in which environmental stimuli is converted to neuronal signaling."
"However, there are many principles that can be generalized across sensory systems. Our sensory systems work by converting different types of stimuli in the environment  into action potentials in the nervous system. This conversion is called sensory transduction and occurs in all sensory systems."
"Sensory transduction begins at the sensory receptors. Each sensory system has specialized cells that are able to detect the environmental stimuli. Photoreceptors detect light, chemical receptors in the tongue and nose detect odors and taste, mechanoreceptors detect touch, and hair cells detect sound."
"We have learned about postsynaptic potentials in neurons, receptor potentials are similar membrane potential changes that happen in sensory receptors in response to a stimulus. Receptive fields are easiest to understand in the visual and somatosensory systems. The receptive field for a neuron is the region of the retina or skin where a stimulus  will evoke a response in the neuron."
Receptive fields in the auditory system can consist of a certain frequency of sound and/or the location of sound in space. Receptive fields can vary in size and shape depending on the characteristics of neuron . Receptive fields become more complex as information travels to the brain.
"Lateral inhibition is a process used by sensory systems to enhance the perception of signals, particularly at edges, points, or other changes in the stimulus. It occurs because overlapping receptive fields can inhibit each other. This inhibition enhances the perceived differences between the stimulus and the area not stimulated."
"There are a number of different ways in which the nervous system encodes complex information. Two that are common within the sensory systems are line coding and population coding. In the labeled line coding of information, one cell encodes for one type of sensory quality."
"Pain is a good example of this. If a pain receptor is activated, the resulting sensation will be pain, regardless of the manner in which the receptor is stimulated. In other words, the sensory neurons are specifically tuned to one sensory stimulus."
"If that receptor-cell type was dysfunctional, the sensation will not be perceived. For example, there is a mutation that prevents sodium channels in pain receptors  from working. When this mutation occurs, the subject cannot feel pain."
"In populating coding, one cell can encode more than one sensory modality, and it is the combination of many cells that make up the perception. An example of this is color vision. Each color photoreceptor is most sensitive to a specific color , but a range of wavelengths can elicit changes in firing rates in the neuron."
"Therefore, the responses from a population of color photoreceptors must be combined to perceive the full spectrum of color. Higher level processing of taste and olfaction also uses population coding – sometimes the sense of smell is needed in addition to the sense of taste to fully perceive a flavor. Have you ever been congested from a cold and food just doesn’t taste the same?"
"That’s due to this combining of the senses for a full perception. In general, the route sensory information takes from the periphery to the central nervous system is similar among most of the systems. Environmental stimuli become encoded by a specialized receptor in the periphery."
"Information then enters the central nervous system via the spinal cord or brainstem and relays through the thalamus, a structure that sits deep in the forebrain. The only sensory system that does not relay through the thalamus is the olfactory system. The thalamus then sends projections out to the primary cortical regions for each sensory system."
It’s common to hear that sensory information “relays” through the thalamus on the way to the cortex . This language can give the impression that the thalamus is only responsible for making sure the sensory signal gets from periphery to the cortex. This greatly underestimates the thalamic role.
The thalamus is known to contribute to the processing and modification of the sensory signal. Humans are remarkably dependent on the visual system to gain information about our surroundings. Consider how tentatively you walk from the light switch to your bed right after turning off the lights!  The visual system is complex and consists of several interacting anatomical structures.
"Here, we will describe the process of how photons of light from our surroundings become signals that the brain turns into representations of our surroundings. Visual sensation starts at the level of the eye. The eye is an organ that has evolved to capture photons, the elementary particle of light."
"Photons are unusual because they behave as both particles and as waves, but neuroscientists mostly focus on the wave-like properties. Because photons travel as waves, they oscillate at different frequencies. The frequency at which a photon oscillates is directly related to the color that we perceive."
"The human visual system is capable of seeing light in a very narrow range of frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum. On the short end, 400 nm wavelengths are observed as violet, while on the long end, 700 nm wavelengths are red. Ultraviolet light oscillates at a wavelength shorter than 400 nm, while infrared light oscillates at a wavelength longer than 700 nm."
"Neither ultraviolet nor infrared light can be detected with our eyes. Photons pass through several anatomical structures before the nervous system processes and interprets them. The front of the eye consists of the cornea, pupil, iris, and lens."
"The cornea is the transparent, external part of the eye. The cornea refracts, or bends, the incoming rays of light so that they converge precisely at the retina, the posterior most part of the eye. If the light rays fail to properly converge, a person would be near-sighted or far-sighted, and this would result in blurry vision."
"Glasses or contact lenses bend light before it reaches the cornea to compensate the cornea’s shape. After passing through the cornea, light enters through a hole in the opening in the iris at the center of the eye called the pupil. The iris is the colored portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil and along with local muscles that can control the size of the pupil to allow for an appropriate amount of light to enter the eye."
"The diameter of the pupil can change depending on ambient light conditions. In the dark, the pupil dilates, or gets bigger, which allows the eye to capture more light. In bright conditions, the pupils constricts, or gets smaller, which decreases the amount of light that enters the eye."
"The next structure that light passes through is the lens. The lens is located behind the pupil and iris. Like the cornea, the lens refracts light so that the rays converge on the retina."
"Proper focusing requires the lens to stretch or relax, a process called accommodation. A circular muscle that surrounds the lens, called the ciliary muscle, changes the shape of the lens depending on the distance of the object of focus. The retina is the light-sensitive region in the back of the eye where the photoreceptors, the specialized cells that respond to light, are located."
"The retina covers the entire back portion of the eye, so it’s shaped like a bowl. In the middle of the bowl is the fovea, the region of highest visual acuity, meaning the area that can form the sharpest images. The optic nerve projects to the brain from the back of the eye, carrying information from the retinal cells."
"Where the optic nerve leaves, there are no photoreceptors since the axons from the neurons are coming together. This region is called the optic disc and is the location of the blind spot in our visual field. In addition to the photoreceptors, there are four other cell types in the retina."
"The photoreceptors synapse on bipolar cells, and the bipolar cells synapse on the ganglion cells. Horizontal and amacrine cells allow for communication laterally between the neuron layers. When light enters the eye and strikes the retina, it must pass through all the neuronal cell layers before reaching and activating the photoreceptors."
The photoreceptors then initiate the synaptic communication back toward the ganglion cells. Photoreceptors are the first cells in the neuronal visual perception pathway. The photoreceptors are the specialized receptors that respond to light.
"They are the cells that detect photons of light and convert them into neurotransmitter release, a process called phototransduction. Morphologically, photoreceptor cells have two parts, an outer segment and inner segment. The outer segment contains stacks of membranous disks bounded within the neuronal membrane."
"These membranous disks contain molecules called photopigments, which are the light-sensing components of the photoreceptors. Hundreds of billions of these photopigments can be found in a single photoreceptor cell. The inner segment contains the nucleus and other organelles."
"Extending from the inner segment is the axon terminal. Photoreceptors are classified into two categories, named because of their appearance and shape: rods and cones. Rod photoreceptors have a long cylindrical outer segment that holds many membranous disks."
"The presence of more membranous disks means that rod photoreceptors contain more photopigments and thus are capable of greater light sensitivity. Cone photoreceptors have a short, tapered c, and cylindrical outer segment that holds fewer membranous disks than rod photoreceptors. The presence of less membranous disks means that cone photoreceptors contain less photopigments and thus are not as sensitive to light as rod photoreceptors."
"Cone photoreceptors are responsible for processing our sensation of color . The typical human has three different types of cone photoreceptors cells, with each of these three types tuned to specific wavelengths of light. The short wavelength cones  respond most robustly to 420 nm violet light."
"The middle wavelength cones  exhibit peak responding at 530 nm green light, and the long wavelength cones  are most responsive in 560 nm red light. Each of these cones is activated by other wavelengths of light too, but to a lesser degree. Every color on the visible spectrum is represented by some combination of activity of these three cone photoreceptors."
"The idea that we have two different cellular populations and circuits that are used in visual perception is called the duplicity theory of vision and is our current understanding of how the visual system perceives light. It suggests that both the rods and cones are used simultaneously and complement each other. The photopic vision, uses cone photoreceptors of the retina, and is responsible for high-acuity sight and color vision in daytime."
"Its counterpart, called scotopic vision, uses rod photoreceptors and is best for seeing in low-light conditions, such as at night. Both rods and cones are used for mesopic vision, when there are intermediate lighting conditions, such as indoor lighting or outdoor traffic lighting at night. In addition to having different visual functions, the rods and cones are also distributed across the retina in different densities."
"Visual information from our peripheral vision is generally detected by our rod cells, which are most densely concentrated outside the fovea. Cone photoreceptor cells allow for high-acuity vision. They are most densely packed at the fovea, corresponding to the very center of your visual field."
"Despite being the cell population that we use for our best vision, cone cells make up the minority of photoreceptors in the human retina, outnumbered by about 20-times more rod cells. Rod cells are organized to have high synaptic convergence, where several rod cells  feed into a single downstream route of communication . An advantage of a high-convergence network is the ability to add many small signals together to create a seemingly larger signal."
"Consider stargazing at night, for example. Each rod is able to detect low levels of light, but signals from multiple rod cells, when summed together, allows you to recognize faint light sources such as a star. A disadvantage of this type of organization is that it is difficult to identify exactly which photoreceptor is activated by the incoming light, which is why accuracy is poor when seeing stimuli in our peripheral vision."
"This is one of the reasons that we cannot actually read text in our peripheral vision or see the distinct edges of a star. Rod photoreceptors are maximally active in low-light conditions. Unlike rod cells, cone cells have very low synaptic convergence."
"In fact, at the point of highest visual acuity, a single cone photoreceptor communicates with a single pathway to the brain. The signaling from low-convergence networks is not additive, so they are less effective at low light conditions. However, because of this low-convergence organization, cone cells are highly effective at precisely identifying the location of incoming light."
The retina is not completely uniform across the entire back of the eye. There are a few spots of particular interest along the retina where the cellular morphology is different: the fovea and the optic disk. There are two cellular differences that explain why the fovea is the site of our best visual acuity.
"For one, the neurons found at the fovea are “swept” away from the center, which explains why the fovea looks like a pit. Cell membranes are made up mostly of lipids, which distort the passage of light. Because there are fewer cell bodies present here, the photons of light that reach the fovea are not refracted by the presence of other neurons."
"Secondly, the distribution of photoreceptors at the fovea heavily leans toward cone type photoreceptors. Because the cone cells at the fovea exhibit low convergence, they are most accurately able to pinpoint the exact location of incoming light. On the other hand, most of the photoreceptors in the periphery are rod cells."
"With their high-convergence circuitry, the periphery of the retina is suited for detecting small amounts of light, though location and detail information is reduced. Another anatomically interesting area of the retina is an elliptical spot called the optic disk. This is where the optic nerve exits the eye."
"At this part of the retina, there is an absence of photoreceptor cells. Because of this, we are unable to perceive light that falls onto the optic disk. This spot in our vision is called the blind spot."
"The photoreceptors are responsible for sensory transduction in the visual system, converting light into electrical signals in the neurons. For our purposes, to examine the function of the photoreceptors, we will A) focus on black and white light  and B) assume the cells are moving from either an area of dark to an area of light or vice versa. Photoreceptors do not fire action potentials; they respond to light changes with graded receptor potentials ."
"Despite this, the photoreceptors still release glutamate onto the bipolar cells. The amount of glutamate released changes along with the membrane potential, so a hyperpolarization will lead to less glutamate being released. Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in light and depolarize in dark."
"In the graphs used in this lesson, the starting membrane potential will depend on the initial lighting condition. When the photoreceptor moves into the light, the cell hyperpolarizes. Light enters the eye, reaches the photoreceptors, and causes a conformational change in a special receptor protein called an opsin."
"The opsin receptor has a pre-bound chemical agonist called retinal. Together, the opsin + retinal makes up the photopigment rhodopsin. When rhodopsin absorbs light, it causes a conformational change in the pre-bound retinal, in a process called “bleaching”."
"The bleaching of rhodopsin activates an associated G-protein called transducin, which then activates an effector enzyme called phosphodiesterase . PDE breaks down cGMP in the cell to GMP. As a result, the cGMP-gated ion channels close."
"The decrease in cation flow into the cell causes the photoreceptor to hyperpolarize. In the dark, the photoreceptor has a membrane potential that is more depolarized than the “typical” neuron we examined in previous chapters; the photoreceptor membrane potential is approximately -40 mV. Rhodopsin is not bleached, thus the associated G-protein, transducin, remains inactive."
"As a result, there is no activation of the PDE enzyme, and levels of cGMP within the cell remain high. cGMP binds to cGMP-gated sodium ion channels, causing them to open. The open cation channels allow the influx of sodium and calcium, which depolarize the cell in the dark."
Photoreceptors synapse onto bipolar cells in the retina. There are two types of bipolar cells: OFF-center bipolar cells and ON-center bipolar cells. These cells respond in opposite ways to the glutamate released by the photoreceptors because they express different types of glutamate receptors.
"Like photoreceptors, the bipolar cells do not fire action potential and only respond with graded postsynaptic potentials. In OFF-center bipolar cells, the glutamate released by the photoreceptor is excitatory. OFF-center bipolar cells express ionotropic glutamate receptors."
"In the dark, the photoreceptor is depolarized, and thus releases more glutamate. The glutamate released by the photoreceptor activates the ionotropic receptors, and sodium can flow into the cell, depolarizing the membrane potential. In the light, the photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, and thus does not release glutamate."
"This lack of glutamate causes the ionotropic receptors to close, preventing sodium influx, hyperpolarizing the membrane potential of the OFF-center bipolar cell. One way to remember this is that OFF-center bipolar cells are excited by the dark . In ON-center bipolar cells, the glutamate released by the photoreceptor is inhibitory."
"ON-center bipolar cells express metabotropic glutamate receptors. In the dark, the photoreceptor is depolarized, and thus releases more glutamate. The glutamate released by the photoreceptor binds to the metabotropic receptors on ON-center bipolar cells, and the G-proteins close cation channels in the membrane, stopping the influx of sodium and calcium, hyperpolarizing the membrane potential."
"In the light, the photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, and thus does not release glutamate. The absence of glutamate results in the ion channels being open and allowing cation influx, depolarizing the membrane potential. You can remember that ON-center bipolar cells are excited by the light ."
"Retinal ganglion cells are the third and last cell type that directly conveys visual sensory information, receiving inputs from the bipolar cells. OFF-center and ON-center bipolar cells synapse on OFF-center and ON-center ganglion cells, respectively. The axons of the retinal ganglion cells bundle together and form the optic nerve, which then exits the eye through the optic disk."
"Retinal ganglion cells are the only cell type to send information out of the retina, and they are also the only cell that fires action potentials. The ganglion cells fire in all lighting conditions, but it is the relative firing rate that encodes information about light. A move from dark to light will cause OFF-center ganglion cells to decrease their firing rate and ON-center ganglion cells to increase their firing rate."
Each bipolar and ganglion cell responds to light stimulus in a specific area of the retina. This region of retina is the cell’s receptive field. Receptive fields in the retina are circular.
"Size of the receptive field can vary. The fovea has smaller receptive fields than the peripheral retina. The size depends on the number of photoreceptors that synapse on a given bipolar cell and the number of bipolar cells that synapse on a given ganglion cell, also called the amount of convergence."
"Let’s use an example of an ON-center bipolar cell to look at the structure of receptive fields in the retina. The bipolar and retinal ganglion cell receptive fields are divided into two regions: the center and the surround. The center of the receptive field is a result of direct innervation between the photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells."
"If a light spot covers the center of the receptive field, the ON-center bipolar cell would depolarize, as discussed above; the light hits the photoreceptor, it hyperpolarizes, decreasing glutamate release. Less glutamate leads to less inhibition of the ON bipolar cell, and it depolarizes. The surround portion of the receptive field is a result of indirect communication among the retinal neurons via horizontal and amacrine cells."
"The surround has an opposing effect on the bipolar or ganglion cell compared to the effect of the center region. That is to say, that the center and surround of the receptive field are opposite to each other. So, an ON-center bipolar or ganglion cell, can also be referred to as an “ON-center OFF-surround cell”, and an OFF-center bipolar or ganglion cell can also be referred to as an “OFF-center ON-surround cell”."
"Therefore, if light covers the surround portion, the ON-center bipolar cell would respond by hyperpolarizing. The light would cause the photoreceptor in the surround to hyperpolarize. This would cause the horizontal cell to also hyperpolarize."
"Horizontal cells have inhibitory synaptic effects, so a hyperpolarization in the horizontal cell would lead to a depolarization in the center photoreceptor. The center photoreceptor would then cause a hyperpolarization in the ON-center bipolar cell. These effects mimic those seen when the center is in dark."
"So, even though the center photoreceptor is not directly experiencing a change in lighting conditions, the neurons respond as if they were moving toward dark. The center-surround structure of the receptive field is critical for lateral inhibition to occur. Lateral inhibition is the ability of the sensory systems to enhance the perception of edges of stimuli."
"It is important to note that the photoreceptors that are in the surround of one bipolar cell would also be in the center of a different bipolar cell. This leads to a direct synaptic effect on one bipolar cell while also having an indirect effect on another bipolar cell. Although some of the images used here will simplify the receptive field to one cell in the center and a couple in the surround, it is important to remember that photoreceptors cover the entire surface of the retina, and the receptive field is two-dimensional."
"Depending on the level of convergence on the bipolar and ganglion cells, receptive fields can contain many photoreceptors. In this chapter we will learn about how the information from the retina is processed centrally within the brain. Before learning the pathway that visual information takes from the retina to the cortex, it is necessary to understand how the retina views the world around us."
"The full visual field includes everything we can see without moving our head or eyes. The full visual field can be divided in a few ways. Each individual eye is capable of seeing a portion of, but not the entire, visual field."
"The full visual field can also be divided into the right and left hemifields. The hemifields range from the most peripheral point to the center point, splitting the full visual field into two equal regions. Both eyes are involved in viewing each hemifield."
The fovea separates the retina into two sections: the nasal retina and the temporal retina. The nasal retina is the medial portion that is located toward the nose. The temporal retina is the lateral portion that is located toward the temples and temporal lobe.
"The nasal retina from one eye along with the temporal retina from the other eye are able to view an entire hemifield. Finally, the full visual field can be separated into monocular and binocular regions. Each monocular field is visual space that can only be viewed by one eye."
"The binocular region is visual space that can be viewed by both eyes. Visual information from each eye leaves the retina via the ganglion cell axons at the optic disc, creating the optic nerve. The optic nerve, or cranial nerve II, exits the posterior end of the eyeball, and travels posteriorly along the ventral surface of the brain."
"Like all other cranial nerves, the optic nerve is paired, meaning there is one for each eye. Both optic nerves merge at a spot called the optic chiasm, then diverge yet again as they travel posteriorly towards the thalamus. The axonal connections in the optic nerve are not quite as simple as its anatomical appearance."
"From each optic nerve, some of the nerve fibers cross the midline , headed towards the contralateral hemisphere. Other nerve fibers meet at the optic chiasm, but then project into the ipsilateral hemisphere. Prior to entering the brain, axons from the nasal portion of each retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm but the temporal portion of each retina does not cross at the optic chiasm."
"Since the axons from the nasal retina cross to the opposite side of the nervous system but the temporal retina axons do not, this leads to the brain processing input from the contralateral  visual hemifield. Therefore, the right side of the brain receives visual information from the left hemifield and vice versa. The easy way to keep track of this unusual system is to remember that all information from the left visual field enters the right hemisphere of the brain, while visual information from the right visual field enters the left hemisphere of the brain."
"The retinal ganglion cells that exit the retina and project into the brain can take different paths. The retinofugal projection  is one of the major projection paths of the retinal ganglion cells. Most retinal output projects to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex, however there are subsets of cells that are routed through other non-thalamic pathways."
"Not all of the axons convey direct visual information into the thalamus for visual perception. Some ganglion cells project to the superior colliculus, a midbrain region via the retinotectal pathway . This pathway communicates with motor nuclei and is responsible for pupillary control."
"Specifically, it is responsible for movements that will orient the head and eyes toward an object to focus the object in the center of the visual field, the region of highest visual acuity. A subset of specialized retinal ganglion cells project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus through the retinohypothalamic tract . It does not carry any conscious visual information."
"The retinohypothalamic tract conducts light information from a small group of intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. This structure functions to help the body adapt its sleep-wake cycle in the face of changing day-night patterns This region is critical for circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake cycle. In conscious visual perception, the first synapse of the optic nerve is formed in the thalamus at a subregion called the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN."
"The optic tract enters the brain and ascends to synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. From there, axons project to the primary visual cortex, also called the striate cortex or V1, located in the occipital lobe. The lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus  has six distinct layers when examined in cross section."
"The LGN serves as the first synaptic site of the retinal ganglion cells that exited the retina. Importantly, visual information is separated at the level of the LGN such that visual information from each visual field is all processed in the contralateral LGN. This means that information from the left visual hemifield, collected via the right temporal retina and the left nasal retina will all be processed within the right LGN."
"Information from the right visual hemifield, collected via the left temporal retina and the right nasal retina will all be processed by the left LGN. Within the LGN, input coming from each eye is kept separate by the layers of the LGN. For example, notice that half of the layers of the right LGN process information from the right eye and the other half of the layers process information from the left eye."
"The outputs of the LGN are a series of axonal bundles called the optic radiations. From the LGN of the thalamus, the optic radiations project to the occipital lobe at the caudal  end of the brain. Once visual information travels into the cortex, the process is less about sensation and mostly about perception."
"The outputs of the LGN are axons which form synapses in the primary visual cortex, which is also called V1 or the striate cortex. ‘Striate’ means ‘stripe’ and is named due to the presence of a large white stripe that can be seen in unstained tissue during surgical dissection. This white stripe is the bundle of incoming optic tract axons, which are heavily myelinated."
"Each neuron in V1 receives visual information from a specific patch of retinal cells. This organizational pattern, where a section of retinal inputs map onto neurons of a specific section of V1, is called retinotopic organization. This retinotopic organization is conserved from the retina to the LGN, and finally to the primary visual cortex."
"Visual information from the fovea, despite being only 1% of the total visual field, takes up about half of all neurons in V1. After processing in V1, visual information is passed along to other cortical areas that contribute to various aspects of visual perception. The cortex of the brain is arranged into six layers, named with the Roman numerals I-VI."
"The cells within these layers have different morphology. These cortical layers are especially visible within the striate cortex . Within this region, the thickness of the cortex between the pia mater that is in contact with the top of the cortex and the white matter underlying the cortex is very thin ."
These cells within the six layers of the cortex are arranged in what are called ‘cortical columns’. This arrangement was discovered by Dr. Vernon Mountcastle in the 1950s.
"You can imagine that due to the directionality of communication in neurons, that information travels up and down the cells within a single cortical column. Dr. David Hubel and Dr."
Torsten Wiesel followed up on this critical discovery by Mountcastle to describe neuronal processing within the visual cortex. Their discoveries in this field led to them being awarded the Nobel Prize in the field of Physiology or Medicine in 1981. Highlighted below are some of their major contributions.
"Hubel and Wiesel used microelectrodes to map the functioning of the visual cortex. In one of their famous experiments, Hubel and Wiesel used anesthetized cats to determine how the visual cortex processes visual information. During their experiment, they were showing the anesthetized cat different visual stimuli through the projection of slides with different images onto a screen while recording from neurons within the visual cortex."
"Due to when this experiment was done, these slides were large and plastic and had to be physically inserted into a projector. In the process of inserting these slides into the projector, a bar of light was projected onto the screen by the edge of the slide. Quite by surprise, the act of changing the slides  caused the neurons within the cat brain to fire action potentials."
"Hubel and Wiesel determined that the stimulus causing the neurons to fire was the angle of the bar of light projected on the screen. In fact, the neurons within the visual cortex responded best to a line in a specific orientation and the firing rate of the neuron increased as the line rotated toward the “preferred” orientation. The firing rate is highest when the line is in the exact preferred orientation and different orientations are preferred by different neurons."
"This discovery was due to some great luck for Hubel and Wiesel as they were recording from neurons that had a preferred orientation that exactly matched the angle of changing the slides in their projector! This orientation selectivity within the visual cortex is the same for all neurons located within a single cortical column. This means that the cells in each cortical column will respond optimally to a line at a preferred orientation. So, if a recording electrode is inserted vertically through the cortex to record from cells within a single cortical column, all cells will respond optimally to the same sensory stimulus."
"If the recording electrode is inserted horizontally, such that it records across multiple cortical columns, each cortical column will respond optimally to a different sensory stimulus. Another experiment by Hubel and Wiesel determined the existence of ocular dominance columns, or columns of neurons within the visual cortex that respond preferentially to either the left or right eye. For this experiment, Hubel and Wiesel injected a radioactive amino acid into one of the eyes of a monkey."
"This amino acid then travels by anterograde transport through the retinal ganglion cells of the eye through the first synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and then through the next synapse with the striate cortex. Radioactivity within the striate cortex can then be visualized through the process of autoradiography. In an autoradiograph image of the striate cortex, there are alternating areas that appear white in color with areas that appear black in color ."
"The areas of the cortex that appear white are the areas that took up the radioactive amino acid and are processing information from the injected eye. The areas of the cortex that appear black are areas that do not have the radioactive amino acid and are processing information from the eye that was not injected. Recall, that although information from the left visual hemifield is processed on the right side of the brain, the left visual hemifield information is collected from both eyes via the left nasal retina and right temporal retina."
"Therefore, both eyes are processed across both the left and right visual cortex. Interestingly, in newborn cats that had not had any visual experience, they did not observe the ocular dominance columns. Instead, they saw that the inputs of the left and right eye overlapped substantially within the visual cortex."
"Hubel and Wiesel were interested in understanding how these ocular dominance columns develop between infancy and adulthood and whether their development was dependent on visual experience. For their experiment, they took a kitten immediately after birth, and sewed the right eye of the kitten closed, so that the eye could no longer have any visual experience, a condition called monocular deprivation . After this six-week period of monocular deprivation, the eye of the cat was reopened so that it could take in the visual environment."
"A control group of cats had normal visual experience for this same six-week period. In control cats that did not experience monocular deprivation, Hubel and Wiesel found that they developed normal ocular dominance columns at six weeks post birth. The cats that experienced monocular deprivation for the first six weeks of life, however, showed abnormal development of the ocular dominance columns."
"The columns that normally served the right eye  shrank in size, and the neighboring columns that served the left eye grew into the unoccupied cortical space. Hubel and Wiesel were able to conclude that visual experience was necessary for the ocular dominance columns to develop. In fact, they found that there was a critical period in cat visual development in the first six weeks of life where visual experience is required for normal visual development."
"Importantly, these structural changes also translated into functional changes for the vision of the cat. Cats that experienced monocular deprivation had decreased visual function in the eye that was sewn shut for the rest of the cat’s life. Even though the sewn shut eye was reopened after the critical period, the development of the ocular dominance columns in the brain was already complete and thus the brain could never process visual information from the sewn shut eye."
Sensory system processing of input does not end upon reaching the primary sensory cortex in any sensory system. Information typically gets sent from the primary sensory cortex to other sensory association regions throughout the brain. The characteristics of sensory information becomes more complex as this higher-level processing occurs.
"In the visual system, there are two broad streams of information that leave the striate cortex. Visual information passes through two streams of communication: the dorsal stream and the ventral stream. In the ventral stream, information travels from the primary visual cortex down through the inferior temporal lobe is responsible for determining object recognition, or what an object is."
"Differentiating between an apple and a person occurs in this stream. In the dorsal stream, information travels from the striate cortex up through the parietal lobe and is responsible for motion or spatial components of vision. The dorsal stream is described as the “where” pathway because these structures help us identify where objects are located in the space around us."
"One of the most important regions in the dorsal pathway is region MT, also called V5, which contributes to perception of motion. In this region, neurons are preferentially activated by a specific direction of movement by an object – for example, left to right or up to down. As an example, remember the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex were activated by lines at a specific orientation."
"Like that, in V5, the neurons would be activated by lines moving in a specific direction. As information continues to be processed through the dorsal stream, the neurons become selective for more complex motions. The dorsal stream is also important for processing our actions in response to visual stimulation, for example, reaching for an object in the visual field or navigating around objects while walking."
"These structures also guide us when we move through our environments, contributing to our sense of spatial awareness. For example, a task such as reaching out to grab an object in front of you uses a combination of these features, so this task is guided largely by dorsal stream structures. The ventral stream is the “what” pathway, and helps in the identification of objects that we see."
"Object identification is a key function of our visual system. The ventral visual stream is responsible for this process. Further, ventral stream structures are important for visual memory."
"Like the more complex activation characteristics of region MT in the dorsal stream, neurons in Area V4 in the ventral stream show more complex receptive fields and show sensitivity to shape and color identification. In fact, there is a rare clinical condition in humans called achromatopsia, in which individuals have partial or complete loss of color vision. These individuals still have normal functioning cones within the retina, and normal LGN and primary visual cortex function."
"Instead, they typically have damage to occipital and temporal lobes, where the ventral stream is located. A major output of area V4 is area IT, located within the inferior temporal lobe. As information travels to area IT it continues to be processed and differentiation of objects occurs."
"Neurons located in area IT are important in learning and memory in visual perception , and have been found to respond to colors and shapes. Another region within the ventral stream called the fusiform face area, located in the fusiform gyrus, which lies on the ventral aspect of the temporal lobe, contains neurons that are activated by faces and can be specialized to one specific face. When the visual system senses these complex stimuli, those signals get processed through these ventral stream pathways."
"These incoming stimuli are compared with the memories stored in the ventral stream, and this comparison contributes to our capacity for perception and identification. The two streams are not independent of each other. Rather, successful organisms require the melding of both components of visual perception."
"For example, imagine you are a prehistoric organism living in a food-scarce environment. Approaching a small berry tree, you would use ventral stream structures to correlate the berries with memories: Did these berries taste good and give me the calories I need to survive? Or did these berries make me violently ill, and are therefore probably poisonous?"
"If they are the delicious berries that I want, I will use the dorsal stream structures to take note of their precise location so I can reach out for them and pick the berries . In this example, proper interaction of the dual streams contributes to goal-driven actions. The inferior temporal lobe also makes reciprocal connections with the structures in the limbic system."
"The limbic system plays an important role in processing emotions and memory, both of which are significant components to visual perception. The amygdala ties visual stimuli with emotions and provides value to objects. A family member will have emotional ties that a stranger will not."
"The hippocampus is responsible for learning and memory and helps establish memories of visual stimuli. Our nervous system is equipped with a variety of specialized biological “tools” that can detect much more than just photons of light. We can detect the shape of air waves, and interpreting those signals give us sound information and the perception of music."
"In this chapter we will trace how sounds travel through the structures of the ear, ultimately causing the auditory receptors to alter their activity and send their signals to the brain. Unlike photons of light, sound waves are compressions and rarefactions of a medium. For us land animals, that medium is usually air, but sound waves can propagate very well in water or through solids."
"Before we get to the anatomical structures involved in sound perception, it is important to first understand the physical nature of sound waves. All sounds, from the clattering of a dropped metal pan to the melodies of a Mozart violin concerto, are contained in their corresponding sound waves. Two components of sound waves are frequency and amplitude."
"Frequency, or “How often do the sound waves compress? ” The greater the frequency, the higher the pitch. The highest notes humans are able to hear is around 20,000 Hz, a painfully-shrill sound for those who can hear it."
"People often tend to lose their high frequency hearing as they age. On the opposite end of the spectrum, low frequency sounds are the deep rumbles of bass, and the human ear can hear sounds down in the 20 Hz range. Amplitude, or “How much do the waves displace the medium from baseline?"
"” The larger the amplitude of the wave, or the greater distance between the peak and the trough of the signal, the louder the sound is. Loudness is measured in decibels . To give you an idea of approximate sound intensities, the background noise of a quiet library is about 40 dB, and a typical conversation is close to 60 dB."
"A rock concert or lawnmower is between 100 and 110 dB, which is right around the pain threshold. Prolonged exposure to these high amplitude sound waves can lead to permanent damage to the auditory system resulting in hearing loss or tinnitus . Our auditory system is a series of physical structures and nervous system components that are responsible for conveying sound waves into meaning and context."
"The external component of the auditory system begins with the pinna. Its shape functions as a funnel, capturing and channeling sound waves into the auditory canal. The pinna and the auditory canal are parts of the outer ear."
"Also, because the pinna is asymmetrical, its shape helps us determine where a sound is coming from. In some nonhumans, the pinna serves these functions and more. For instance, some animals are able to disperse excess heat through their ears , and some even use them to display emotion ."
"At the end of the auditory canal is the tympanic membrane, or ear drum. This membrane is a very delicate piece of tissue at only 0. 1 mm thin and is subject to damage by physical injury such as head trauma, nearby explosions, or even changes in air pressure during scuba diving."
"When incoming sound waves reach the tympanic membrane, it vibrates at a matching frequency, and amplitude. The tympanic membrane also represents the boundary between the outer ear and the middle ear. The middle ear is an air-filled chamber."
"Physically attached to the tympanic membrane are the ossicles, a series of three bones that convey that vibrational sound information. These bones in order, called the malleus, incus, and stapes, conduct vibrations of the tympanic membrane through the air-filled middle ear. The stapes has a footplate that attaches to a structure called the oval window, which serves as the junction between the middle ear and the inner ear."
"The middle ear serves important functions in both sound amplification and sound attenuation. The tympanic membrane and the ossicles function to amplify incoming sounds, generally by a tenfold difference. This amplification is accomplished through 2 mechanisms:  Due to the ossicles being connected, the ossicles act in a lever-like fashion to amplify the movements of the tympanic membrane to the oval window The stapes has a smaller area on the oval window than the tympanic membrane, thus movements of the larger tympanic membrane must be transformed into smaller and stronger vibrations at the oval window."
"This amplification is important because the inner ear is filled with liquid rather than air, and sound waves do not travel very well when moving from air into a denser medium – think about how muffled sounds are when you submerge your head underwater. The movement of the ossicles are partially regulated by two different muscles, the tensor tympani muscle which connects with the malleus, and the stapedius muscle which connects to the stapes. When these muscles contract, it causes the ossicles to be more rigid and for the ossicles to move less, which decreases the intensity of loud sounds."
"This response, called the acoustic reflex, dampens incoming sound by about 15 dB. The muscles contract at the onset of loud noises with a slight delay of 50-100ms. The inner ear is a fluid-filled structure made up of two structures: the cochlea that functions in hearing, and the semicircular canals that function in balance."
"The auditory part of this structure is a small spiral-shaped structure about the size of a pea, called the cochlea  The cochlea has two small holes at its base: the oval window and the round window. When we examine a cross-section of the cochlea, we can see that there are 3 distinct fluid-filled chambers called the scala vestibuli, the scala media, and the scala tympani. These chambers are separated from each other by membranes."
The fluid found within the scala vestibuli and scala tympani is called perilymph and it has a low concentration of potassium and a high concentration of sodium. The scala media is filled with a fluid called endolymph that has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium. Reissner’s membrane separates the scala vestibuli from the scala media.
"The basilar membrane separates the scala tympani from the scala media. Think of the cochlea as a rolled-up cone. If this cone was theoretically unrolled, the widest diameter portion, called the base, would be closest to the oval window, while the narrowest portion, called the apex, would be at the center of the spiral."
The basilar membrane runs down the middle of the cochlea. The width of the basilar membrane changes as it runs down the length of the cochlea from the base to the apex. This change in shape from the base to the apex is important: objects with different stiffness vibrate at different frequencies.
"The base of the cochlea is stiff and rigid and will vibrate at high frequencies. Whereas the apex is wider and less stiff, so it vibrates at lower frequencies. Because different frequencies of sound affect different areas of the basilar membrane, the basilar membrane is what is referred to as tonotopically organized."
"In fact, you can think about the way that frequencies are mapped to the basilar membrane similar to a backwards piano. Let’s consider how sounds will affect the cochlea. For simplicity’s sake, the figure here shows only the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani  with the basilar membrane running down the middle."
"Keep in mind that due to the flexibility of Reissner’s membrane that separates the scala vestibuli from the scala media, we can assume that pressure changes in the scala vestibuli are transferred through the scala media, ultimately affecting the basilar membrane. When sounds move through the outer and middle ear, it causes vibration of the stapes footplate at the oval window. The movement of the stapes at the oval window is similar to a piston pushing at the oval window at the same frequency and amplitude as the incoming sound."
"When the stapes pushes into the oval window, it causes movement of the perilymph within the scala vestibuli. This causes the sounds to move through the cochlea as a wave from the base to the apex, displacing the flexible basilar membrane at different locations dependent on the frequency of sound. At the apex of the basilar membrane is a hole called the helicotrema that connects the perilymph of the scala vestibuli to the perilymph of the scala tympani and allows for the pressure to be transferred from the scala vestibuli to the scala tympani."
The pressure then moves through the scala tympani back towards the base of the cochlea until it pushes out at the round window. Embedded within the basilar membrane is a structure called the Organ of Corti. The Organ of Corti is the first nervous system structure that is responsible for processing physical vibrations and converting them into signals that the nervous system can interpret.
"The Organ of Corti contains the components necessary for converting sound waves into action potentials. Recall that the scala media that surrounds the Organ of Corti contains endolymph, a fluid that has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium. A separate membrane hangs over the Organ of Corti called the tectorial membrane."
"Recall that “tectum” means roof. The tectorial membrane acts as a roof over the Organ of Corti. Embedded along the interior surface of the Organ of Corti are the somata of hair cells, the primary sensory neurons that interpret physical movement."
"They are named “hair cells” because of their cellular structure; each hair cell has somewhere between 30 and a few hundred hair-shaped stereocilia that protrude away from the Organ of Corti, reaching into the endolymph. Importantly, hair cells are not neurons. They do not produce action potentials and do not have axons."
"In fact, hair cells are a specialized type of epithelial cell. We have two different populations of hair cells, the inner hair cells and outer hair cells. The outer hair cells are arranged in three rows."
Their stereocilia extend into the endolymph  and are physically embedded within the tectorial membrane. The inner hair cells are arranged in a single row. Their stereocilia extend into the endolymph but are not embedded within the tectorial membrane.
"Instead, the stereocilia of the inner hair cells freely float within the endolymph. Although the hair cells themselves are not neurons, the mechanical bending of the hair cell stereocilia will be converted into a neural signal. Hair cells synapse on spiral ganglion cells ."
"The axons of the spiral ganglion cells make up the auditory nerve, which will project into the cochlear nuclei of the medulla. As we have learned, when a vibration reaches the oval window, this causes the basilar membrane to move in response to the change in pressure. The basilar membrane is located at the base of the hair cells, and as the basilar membrane moves up and down, it pushes the hair cell stereocilia into the tectorial membrane above, causing the stereocilia to bend."
Let’s take a closer look at the structure of the hair cell. The stereocilia of the hair cell have different lengths and are arranged from shortest to tallest. At the tip of each stereocilium are mechanically-gated ion channels.
These are mechanically-gated because they open and close in response to physical movement. The stereocilia are linked together with spring-like proteins called linker proteins. These linker proteins are specifically attached to small covers that block movement through mechanically-gated ion channels when closed.
"The stereocilia can bend in two different directions, toward the shortest stereocilium or towards the tallest stereocilium. At rest , the stereocilia are not bent. Some of the mechanically-gated ion channels are open, and some are closed."
"When the stereocilia bend towards the tallest stereocilium, the distance between the stereocilia increases and the spring-like linker proteins are stretched, causing the opening of the covers on the mechanically-gated ion channels. Recall that the stereocilia are surrounded by endolymph, which is high in potassium and low in sodium. When the mechanically-gated ion channels are opened, potassium ions will flow into the hair cells, moving down its concentration gradient."
"As the positively charged potassium ions move into the hair cell, it causes the hair cell to depolarize. If the stereocilia instead bend towards the shortest stereocilium, the distance between the stereocilia gets smaller. The mechanically-gated ion channels cannot open and the channels that were previously opened when the cell was at rest, will now be shut."
"As a result, there is less potassium influx into the hair cell and thus less positive charge in the hair cell than there was at rest, leading to hair cell hyperpolarization. Located within the hair cell are vesicles that are filled with glutamate . When hair cells are depolarized, this causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the hair cell membrane."
"The influx of calcium will ultimately cause the vesicles full of glutamate to fuse with the hair cell membrane and release the glutamate into the synapse with the spiral ganglion cell. Most of the spiral ganglion cells  collect information from the inner hair cells. In fact, one inner hair cell will synapse onto many different spiral ganglion cells."
"Whereas a small number of spiral ganglion cell  collect information from the outer hair cells. Thus, the inner hair cells are responsible for sending the majority of auditory signals from the cochlea into the brain for processing. Although the outer hair cells are not responsible for the majority of the signal to the spiral ganglion cells, they serve another function."
The outer hair cells function as the cochlear amplifier to increase the intensity of vibrations within the cochlea. It is estimated that the outer hair cells increase sound by anywhere between 20 and 80 dB. There is a motor protein called prestin within the outer hair cell membrane.
"As a motor protein, prestin can mechanically contract and elongate within the outer hair cells, changing the length of the outer hair cell. The membrane of the outer hair cell shortens and lengthens with the movement of the basilar membrane. When the basilar membrane is displaced upwards, this causes the prestin protein to contract, further shortening the length of the outer hair cell."
"When the basilar membrane is displaced downward, the prestin protein elongates the length of the outer hair cell. Essentially, the prestin within the outer hair cells amplifies the movement of the basilar membrane in both directions. When the cochlear amplifier is functional, it doesn’t only change the displacement of the basilar membrane, but it also has effects on the inner hair cells."
"The cochlear amplifier will cause the inner hair cells to bend more than they would without the amplifier present. In this way, although the outer hair cells have fewer direct signals to the spiral ganglion cells, they still contribute to the firing of the auditory nerve through their influence on the inner hair cells. Many people experience permanent hearing loss, a decrease in volume by 25 dB or more."
"Hearing loss is divided into two categories. Conductive hearing loss is a result of changes to the auditory system up to the oval window, such as a tumor in the ear canal, a perforation of the tympanic membrane, or changes in middle ear pressure . Sensorineural hearing loss results from changes at the level of the inner ear or further up in the neural pathway, such as hair cell damage, a brain tumor, bacterial or viral infections, or exposure to various toxins or drugs."
"The most common cause of hearing loss is excessive noise exposure. Although the acoustic reflex is capable of dampening the intensity of the incoming vibrations, prolonged exposure to high amplitude sound waves can still cause damage. Motorcycles, the maximum volume on headphones, or loud venues like concerts and clubs can produce sounds in the 95-110 dB range, which can cause some permanent hearing loss."
"Additionally, the acoustic reflex is not fast enough to minimize damage from sudden, loud sounds in excess of 120 dB, such as a gunshot. All of these sources of acoustic trauma are preventable by wearing appropriate hearing protection, which can decrease the intensity of sounds by up to 30 dB. Old age is another common cause of hearing loss, likely because older people have had more accumulated exposure to noise."
"An estimated 1 in 3 people older than 65 have hearing deficits. We are born with about 15,000 hair cells, but throughout the course of our life, many get damaged irreparably. Hair cells at the base of the cochlear are more sensitive to injury, so it is common for people to lose sensitivity to high-frequency sounds."
"The loss of these hair cells can begin as early as a person’s 20s. Partial hearing loss can be reversed with the help of medical devices. A hearing aid is a processor that helps to filter out background noise, decrease pitch, and amplify incoming sounds."
"A cochlear implant is a surgically-implanted device that receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve via electrodes, bypassing the external components of the auditory system. All sensory systems follow the same general path of communication into our nervous systems and awareness. First, the incoming signal must reach a that can change its electrical properties in response to the stimulus."
"Then, that information initiates a series of signals into the CNS, reaching structures such as the thalamus, primary sensory cortical areas, and finally, higher order perception. Although there are several sensory components throughout our body that detect these signals, there are no sensory receptors in our central nervous system. We previously saw this pattern for the visual system, and now we’ll see it mirrored in many ways by the auditory system."
"For the auditory system, following the activation of hair cells within the cochlea, sound information is transmitted to brain structures including the thalamus and cortex for processing to be perceived as sounds. Hair cells within the cochlea form glutamatergic synapses onto spiral ganglion cells. The axons of these neurons make up the vestibulocochlear nerve ."
"Neurons project to and synapse on neurons within the ipsilateral cochlear nuclei of the medulla. Because the medulla neurons only process sound from one ear, these cells are referred to as monaural. ."
"The cochlear nuclei neurons within the medulla have axons that split and synapse on both the ipsilateral and contralateral superior olive within the pons. The superior olive is the first structure that processes sound information from both ears, so it is referred to as binaural. All remaining structures in the central auditory pathway process sounds from both ears, and thus are also binaural."
"From the pons, neurons travel via the lateral lemniscus  and then synapse on the inferior colliculus of the midbrain tectum. Signaling within the inferior colliculus is important for interactions between multiple sensory inputs and a motor response. These inferior colliculus neurons are particularly responsive to biologically-relevant sounds, such as unexpected noises, which may signal an approaching predator."
"Processing in the inferior colliculus helps the animal focus their attention on these stimuli. The inferior colliculus then conveys that auditory information into the medial geniculate nucleus, one of the nuclei of the thalamus. These thalamic neurons then send projections into the primary auditory cortex located dorsally in the temporal lobe."
"The structures responsible for the central processing of sound, including the basilar membrane, the spiral ganglion, the cochlear nucleus, the inferior colliculus, and the auditory cortex are tonotopically organized, meaning that adjacent physical areas are responsible for conveying information from adjacent frequencies. For example, the hair cells that respond most to 440 Hz vibrations are right next to cells that respond maximally to 441 Hz, but far away from cells that respond most to 14,000 Hz. Likewise, in the auditory cortex, the cells that best process 440 Hz are adjacent to those that best process 441 Hz, but far away from those that maximally respond to 14,000 Hz."
"The auditory cortex  is located within the temporal lobes in both hemispheres of the brain. Similar to the visual cortex, the auditory cortex is also made up of 6 layers of cells that have columnar organization. Each cortical column responds to a specific frequency."
"The auditory cortex is tonotopically organized like the other structures in the central auditory pathway. It is organized as isofrequency bands, like strips, that respond to relatively the same frequency. Sound localization is an important function for animals."
"We can localize sounds in the horizontal plane and the vertical plane via different mechanisms. When considering how we localize sounds in the horizontal plane, we assume that the sound does not change in elevation. As humans, our ears are located on the sides of our heads, which means that sounds will arrive at our ears at different times depending on the origin of the sound."
"The time between when sound reaches the first ear until the time it reaches the second ear is referred to as the interaural time difference . If we assume that there are 20 cm between the two ears of a human, then we can determine the ITD for the left ear. If a sound is coming directly from the right, then there will be a 0."
"6 msec ITD for the left ear. If sounds are coming from directly in front of a person, then the time that it takes to reach the right ear will be exactly the same as the time that it takes to reach the left ear, thus there is no ITD . If we consider an intermediary angle of sound origin coming from 45° we can determine that the ITD will be 0."
"3 msec, exactly between the values from when sounds originate directly in front and directly to the right. In order for us to locate sounds in the horizontal plane, we need a brain structure that can process information from both ears. Recall from the central auditory pathway that the first structure that processes information from both ears  is the superior olive."
One of the primary functions of the superior olive is to help us figure out if a sound originates from the left or the right side of our head by determining this interaural time difference. Let’s imagine a sound wave originating from the left. The sound will interact with the left ear before it interacts with the right ear.
"When the sound interacts with the left ear, it will activate the hair cells in the left cochlea, the left spiral ganglion, and then the left cochlear nucleus . The left cochlear nucleus cells will generate action potential that will travel along their axons toward the superior olive. After a short delay, the sound wave will interact with the right ear, thus activating the hair cells of the right cochlea, the right spiral ganglion, and the right cochlear nucleus."
"The right cochlear nucleus will then generate its own action potential that will travel toward the superior olive. While this is occurring, the action potential generated by the left cochlear nucleus has traveled further along the left cochlear nucleus cell axon. The action potentials generated from both the left and right cochlear nucleus will converge within the superior olive ."
"The axons of the cochlear nucleus cells have different length paths before they reach the neurons of the superior olive, allowing them to act as ‘delay lines’. The neurons of the superior olive act as coincidence detectors. When the action potentials arrive at one superior olive neuron at the same time, the postsynaptic potentials will summate, leading to maximal activation of this superior olive neuron and the generation of an action potential."
"If the action potentials do not arrive at the same time, then summation will not occur. The specific superior olive neuron that experiences the summation translates to where in the horizontal plane the sound originated, allowing us to localize sounds. Humans are better at localizing sounds in the horizontal plane when we can detect the onset of the sound."
"However, when there are continuous tones, we need to utilize different ways to localize sounds in the horizontal plane. We can use interaural intensity  differences to localize sounds when they are continuous. Sounds are louder the closer you are to them."
"A difference in volume between what one ear and the other ear perceives can also be evaluated by neurons in the superior olive. Interaural intensity differences are also useful in localizing high frequency sounds in the horizontal plane. At high frequencies , the head creates a ‘sound shadow’ for the ear opposite the sound."
"When a high frequency sound is coming directly from the right side, the head creates a sound shadow for the left ear, making the sound louder for the right ear than it is for the left ear. Again, if a high frequency sound originates from directly in front of a person, then the sound will reach the ears with the same intensity, as the sound shadow will be behind the head. When a high frequency sound originates from an intermediate angle, then there will be intermediate intensity differences between the two ears."
"Low frequency sounds do not create a sound shadow like high frequency sounds. This is because the wavelength of low frequency waves  have a wavelength longer than the width of the distance between the ears, so the intensity will be the same at both ears but the sound will arrive at the two ears at different times . High frequency sounds  have a wavelength that is shorter than the width of the distance between the ears, which is why the head creates a sound shadow that will alter the intensity of the sound between the two ears."
"Interaural time difference is used for low frequency sounds in the 20-2000 Hz range, whereas interaural intensity difference is used for high frequency sounds in the 2000-20,000 Hz range. Together these two processes are called the duplex theory of sound localization. Because both ears  are at the same height, sounds in the vertical plane that change in elevation alone can be difficult to localize."
This is because the interaural time difference and interaural intensity between the two ears remains constant as elevation changes. This is why sometimes people and animals tilt their heads to try to hear better. The structure of our pinna is important in vertical localization.
"Recall that our pinna is the external portion of our ear that funnels sounds into the auditory canal. For sound localization, the pinna has many ridges and folds, which cause sound waves to be reflected off these bumps and take different paths on their way to the auditory canal. The pinna of humans is relatively fixed in location, but other animals  have the ability to move their pinna to better localize sounds."
"Interestingly, not all animals have ears that are located at the same height on their head. Some species of owls have ear openings at different heights on their heads, increasing their ability to localize the source of a sound on the vertical axis. By having ears at different heights, the owls are able to use interaural time differences in the vertical plane because the sound will reach their ears at different times."
"When we tilt our head to the side, or look up and down, that movement information is conveyed to our brain using the vestibular system. The vestibular system is a sort of three-dimensional compass that can detect head movement, and that information helps us figure out how our head is oriented and how to balance ourselves in changing conditions. The vestibular system is made up of two structures that are intimately tied in with the anatomical features of the inner ear."
"Adjacent to the cochlea within the inner ear is a structure called the vestibular labyrinth made up of the otolith organs  and the semicircular canals. Next to the cochlea and within the vestibular labyrinth are two membranous sacs, the saccule and the utricle. Collectively, these structures are called the otolith organs and are responsible for determining gravity through the tilt of the head and linear acceleration."
"These structures are centrally located within the vestibular labyrinth. Due to their differences in structure, the two otolith organs have slightly different functions. The saccule is more sensitive to vertical movements, like when you are standing in a moving elevator."
"The utricle is more responsive to horizontal movements, such as when driving. Similar to the other inner ear structure, the cochlea, the structures of the vestibular labyrinth also contain hair cells. The hair cells located within the otolith organs are biologically similar to the hair cells in the cochlea."
"These hair cells have stereocilia that extend into a gelatinous cap that contains otoconia, which are small crystals of calcium carbonate. The otolith organs are important in sensing gravity. Tilting the head causes the otoconia to move , which will push the hair cell stereocilia and cause them to bend."
"The tallest stereocilium  is called the kinocilium. Similar to the function of hair cells within the cochlea, movement that bends the stereocilia toward the kinocilium results in depolarization due to potassium influx through open mechanically-gated ion channels within the tips of the stereocilia. Movement that bends the stereocilia away from the kinocilium causes the mechanically-gated ion channels to close, decreasing potassium influx and causing hyperpolarization."
"The other major structure of the vestibular labyrinth are the semicircular canals. The semicircular canals are the structures that are responsible for detecting head rotation and angular acceleration. Anatomically, the semicircular canals are a series of three arch-shaped membranous tubes within the vestibular labyrinth, each one oriented at a right angle to each other."
"Because of this shape, the semicircular canals sense and convey information about any direction of head movement. These semicircular canals are filled with endolymph, the same potassium-rich solution that is in the cochlea that is important for auditory sensation. At the end of each of the three canals is a small swelling called the ampulla."
"Contained in the ampulla is a gelatinous membrane called the cupula. Here, hair cells extend stereocilia into the cupula. The tallest stereocilium is again referred to as the kinocilium."
"When we rotate our head, the endolymph within the semicircular canals has a delay in movement due to inertia, and as a result the endolymph will move the cupula in the opposite direction of head movement. The physical movement of the cupula also pushes the cilia of the hair cells within the cupula. As previously discussed in the cochlea and the otolith organs, these hair cells also have mechanically-gated ion channels located in the tips of the stereocilia and function in the same way, with deflection towards the kinocilium resulting in depolarization and deflection away from the kinocilium resulting in hyperpolarization."
"When we stop rotating, the endolymph within the semicircular canals continues to move for a brief period of time due to inertia . The vestibular system is responsible for coordinating our balance through our head and body movements. As such, the neurons of the vestibular system signal to motor neurons that adjust head, eye, and body position."
"The vestibular hair cell information is passed to the brain via excitatory synapses onto a branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve . The cell bodies of these neurons are in Scarpa’s ganglion. These axons send projections to several brain areas, notably the cerebellum, which is a structure critically important for balance."
"CN VIII also projects into the vestibular nuclei of the medulla. From there, neurons signal to areas of the thalamus that ultimately control motor areas of the face, extraocular motor neurons that ultimately control eye movement, and the spinal cord that is responsible for limb and neck motor movements to help maintain body and head position. Your gustatory system, which mediates your sense of taste, helps you walk the line between health and illness."
"It acts as a short-range detection system, as you must actually put something in your mouth to taste it. The gustatory system guides you towards foods that are energy rich and keeps you away from food that could make you sick. Humans can perceive five basic tastes: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami."
"These specific taste modalities all support this balance. Sweet foods taste good because foods rich in sugar, such as fruit and wheat, contain large amounts of usable energy, and humans have evolved to find these foods appetizing. In contrast, toxic compounds are often bitter, causing you to respond with feelings of disgust."
"Salty taste indicates a substance with high salt content and sour taste indicates an acidic food, and umami taste indicates a high protein food. Some of our taste is innate, like sweetness, whereas other tastes are learned like bitterness. This explains why many individuals do not initially like the taste of coffee, and why many individuals prefer to have their coffee with sugar when they first start drinking it."
"Our tastes can also be modified by our dietary needs, like craving a salty food. Although taste receptor cells are most prevalent on the tongue, there are other regions of the mouth and throat, including the palate, pharynx, and epiglottis, that also are sensitive to food and play a role in taste perception. Other sensory information is also tightly linked to our sense of taste."
Smell is important in our sense of taste as odorant compounds from food can reach odor receptors in the nasal cavity. How a food looks  is also important to how it tastes. The texture and temperature of the food is also important .
"Even a sense of pain, related to the spicy level of the food relates to our sense of taste. The surface of the tongue is covered in small, visible bumps called papillae. Taste buds are located within the papillae, and each taste bud is made up of taste receptor cells, along with supporting cells and basal cells, which will eventually turn into taste receptors cells."
"The taste cells have a lifespan of approximately two weeks, and the basal cells replace dying taste cells. The taste cells have microvilli that open into the taste pore where chemicals from the food can interact with receptors on the taste cells. Although taste cells are not technically neurons, they synapse and release neurotransmitters on afferent axons that send taste perception information to the brain."
"The entire tongue is capable of perceiving all five tastes, meaning there are taste receptors for each taste present across the entire surface. However, some regions of the tongue have a slightly lower threshold to respond to some tastes over others. The tip of the tongue is the region most sensitive to sweet, salt, and umami tastes."
"The sides are most sensitive to sour, and the back of the tongue to bitter tastes. Currently, it is believed that humans sense five basic tastes: Salty, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami. Salty and sour taste are both mediated by ionotropic taste receptors, while sweet, bitter, and umami taste are mediated by metabotropic taste receptors."
"Salt taste is mediated by the presence of epithelial sodium channels. These receptors are usually open, and when foods are ingested with high salt concentrations, sodium flows into the cell causing a depolarization. This change in membrane potential opens voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels."
The increased calcium influx causes the release of serotonin-filled vesicles. The serotonin acts on the afferent taste axon causing depolarization and action potentials. Salty foods elicit a biphasic response depending on concentration.
"Foods cooked with a low concentration of salt taste bland and are not very appetizing; however, high salt concentrations elicit a strong aversive reaction – imagine how disgusted you were when you first tried to cook and were overly generous with the salt!  Additionally, the appeal of salt at a given moment depends on our body’s need for salt at the time. Several hormones such as the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin contribute to regulating the concentration of salt in the body by mediating Na+ absorption. Current salt levels can also impact appetite for salt."
"For example, in chronically-sodium deprived animals, high salt solutions are highly rewarding. Why are we so sensitive to the taste of salt? As it turns out, both sodium and chloride are essential nutrients."
"They are critical for maintaining blood volume and pressure, for regulating body water, for maintaining muscle contractions, and mediating action potentials. Foods taste sour because of their acidity, and when acids are present in water, they produce hydrogen ions . Therefore, a sour food has high acidity and a high concentration of hydrogen ions, thus a low pH."
"The exact mechanism for sour taste transduction has yet to be worked out, but it is believed that protons enter the cell through an ion channel, and then block potassium channels. The decreased efflux of potassium, along with the presence of the protons, depolarizes the cell causing voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels to open. Like salt taste transduction, the increase in intracellular calcium causes release of serotonin into the synapse."
"The purpose for our ability to sense acids in our food is under debate. Sour tastants do not inherently provide any nutritional value, except in the case of Vitamin C. Humans and other higher primates cannot synthesize Vitamin C on their own, so it’s possible that we evolved to find a combination of sourness and sweetness attractive enough to consistently consume Vitamin C-rich fruits."
"However, sour can be aversive, motivating us to avoid spoiled or unripe foods that might contain pathogens. Bitter, sweet, and umami compounds all activate taste receptor cells via G-protein coupled receptors. The bitter receptors are from the T2R family of receptor proteins; humans have over 25."
"Each taste cell can express most or all of the different receptor types, allowing for the detection of numerous molecules, which is important when wanting to avoid dangerous substances like poisons and toxins. Activation of the G-protein receptor activates phospholipase C, which in turn increases production of the second messenger inositol triphosphate. Inositol triphosphate causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores."
"Calcium causes the opening of ion channels, allowing the influx of sodium. These ion changes depolarize the cell and cause ATP-specific channels to open, allowing ATP to flow out of the cell and enter the synapse to act on the afferent taste axon by binding to purinergic receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Sweet and umami receptors are comprised of G-protein coupled dimers, meaning two separate proteins function together as one."
The receptors are encoded by the T1R family of receptor proteins. Sweet receptors are dimers of the T1R2 and T1R3 proteins. Both proteins need to be present and functioning for activation of a sweet taste cell.
"Like bitter cells, activation of the G-protein receptor uses a second messenger system to release calcium from intracellular stores and increase the influx of sodium. These ion changes depolarize the cell and cause ATP-specific channels to open, allowing ATP to enter the synapse and act on the afferent taste axon. Sugars like glucose and sucrose are essential for the survival of a species, since they are the main source of cellular energy."
"Therefore, our ability to detect sweetness plays a central role in regulating how much energy we take into our bodies. Of all the taste modalities, sweet is the strongest driver of food selection. Umami is the taste of savory deliciousness, such as the taste of rich chicken broth, a perfect medium-rare steak, or aged cheese."
"The word is derived from the Japanese word umai, which means “delicious. ” Umami is signaled when a molecule of glutamate  binds to T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Umami receptors are comprised of the T1R3 protein, like the sweet receptor, but it is paired with the T1R1 protein."
"Once the G-protein coupled receptor is activated, the transduction pathway is the same as bitter and sweet taste cells. Through evolution, we have come to prefer the taste of umami because glutamate is a byproduct of cooking food. Cooking foods changes their chemical properties, thereby improving digestion, reducing toxicity, and increasing absorption of nutrients."
"Glutamate is one of the byproducts in the process of heating a food, and so it benefits us to appreciate these flavors. Of the five tastes, only two neurotransmitters are used to communicate information to the central nervous system, so how does our brain know what tastes to perceive? The answer is how the information is encoded."
"Most taste cells use a labeled line coding method, which means that each cell and the related afferent taste axon only responds to one type of taste. For example, bitter cells only express bitter receptors and are only activated by bitter molecules. These bitter taste cells activate bitter sensory neurons and bitter regions of the taste cortex."
"A small portion of taste cells do use population coding as well, meaning more than one tastant can activate the cell, and perception is based on a combination of multiple cells each with a different response. Most information, however, is encoded via labeled line at the level of the taste cell. The tongue is innervated by three cranial nerves."
"The front two-thirds of the tongue is innervated by cranial nerve VII . The back third is innervated by cranial nerve IX . Finally, the epiglottis and pharynx are innervated by cranial nerve X ."
"All three cranial nerves enter the brainstem at the medulla and synapse in the nucleus of the solitary tract. From there, information is sent to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. Thalamic neurons send projections to the gustatory cortex."
"The gustatory cortex is located deep in the lateral fissure in a region called the insula. Information processing taste stays primarily on the ipsilateral side of the nervous system that is to say, taste information from the left half of the tongue gets represented in the left hemisphere of the brain, and visa versa. ."
"Projections within the brain also exist between the taste regions and the hypothalamus and amygdala. How do 5 basic tastes turn into the myriad complex taste sensations we experience when eating food? Olfaction plays an important role in the perception of flavor, as do vision and touch."
"Taste information combines with information from these other sensory systems in the orbitofrontal cortex located in the frontal lobe. This region is believed to be important for the pleasant and rewarding aspects of food. Additionally, as taste is processed in higher-order regions of the CNS, information is combined using population coding mechanisms."
"Olfaction is the ability to sense and perceive volatile chemicals that are suspended in the air. The typical human can distinguish up to 10,000 distinct odors, ranging from the sweet aroma of esters produced by apples and oranges, to the putrid smells of sulfurous compounds produced by skunks and rotten eggs. Because odors can drift along in the air, some chemicals can be detected long before the source is within eyesight: think about smelling a burning bonfire from miles away."
Smells affect our conscious behavior. They can motivate us to approach freshly-baked bread or avoid a rotting animal carcass. These chemicals serve as survival cues: bread gives us energy-rich carbohydrates while a decaying carcass can expose us to disease.
"Smell is often used in communication between animals, especially  in reproductive behaviors, territory marking and identification of individuals. Olfaction is one of the oldest functions we possess as animals. While our sense of smell has seemed to take a backseat to other senses relative to other animals , scientists now appreciate that our olfactory system is simply more specialized."
"For example, humans use the smells of sweat to clue us into the emotional state of others, and we can even subconsciously detect sickness through body odor. Your sensation of smell begins when odorant molecules travel through your nostrils and pass through the nasal cavity, an empty, air-filled space just behind the front of the skull. The odorants dissolve in the mucus covered dorsal-most portion of the nasal cavity, an area called the olfactory epithelium."
"Embedded within the olfactory epithelium are olfactory receptor neurons, supporting cells, and basal cells. The axons of the olfactory receptor neurons travel through a sheet of bone called the cribiform plate before going to the olfactory bulb. Collectively, the axons of the olfactory receptor neurons make up Cranial Nerve 1 ."
"Also found within the olfactory epithelium and surrounding the olfactory receptor neurons are supporting cells and basal cells. The supporting cells help dispose of dead and dying cells, metabolize pollutants, and may also help to physically maintain the epithelium by producing mucus. The basal cells function to replace the olfactory receptor neurons."
"The olfactory receptor neurons begin processing smell. They serve as the sensory neurons for the olfactory system. Olfactory receptor neurons are bipolar neurons,  that have a single dendrite with many cilia that are exposed to the epithelial surface."
"The cilia stretch into the mucus of the olfactory epithelium and act to increase the surface area of the neurons, providing increased space for odorants to interact with the olfactory receptor neurons. When the odorants dissolve in the mucus they interact with odorant receptor proteins on the cilia of the olfactory receptor neuron. Their proximity to the air make them the only neurons that are directly exposed to the outside world."
"Unfortunately, this causes them to encounter all sorts of dangers such as toxins, particulates, and microbes. They are one of the few known populations of neurons where adult neurogenesis regularly occurs, each having a lifespan in the range of 30 days to a year. The average human olfactory system has somewhere between 6-20 million olfactory receptor neurons."
"Though taste uses different signaling systems for transduction of each of the different tastes, olfaction uses a single system for transduction. First, odorants bind to odorant receptor proteins  on the cilia of the olfactory receptor neurons. It is estimated there are about 1,000 different genes  that code for roughly 400 different odorant receptor proteins."
Each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one type of odorant receptor protein. The initial research into the genetics underlying these neurons earned Drs. Linda Buck and Richard Axel a Nobel prize in 2004.
"Odorant receptor proteins are transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors that have extracellular binding sites on their surface that bind to odorants. Each receptor differs in their specific binding pockets. Importantly, the receptor does not bind to one specific odorant, but rather binds to a specific molecular feature of the odorant."
"This means that many odorants can activate more than one odorant receptor protein, ultimately allowing each odorant to generate a unique pattern of activity across the olfactory receptor neurons. Thus, analyzing the activity of a single olfactory receptor neuron is not sufficient to understand how that odorant alters neural signaling. Rather, the olfactory system uses population coding."
"In this example we are looking at three different olfactory receptor neurons that express different types of odorant receptor proteins labeled Cell 1 , Cell 2 , and Cell 3 . These neurons are exposed to four different odorants , and their neural activity is measured via an electrode. When looking at the response to the ‘Vanilla” odor, cell 1 shows an increase in the rate of action potentials, cell 2 shows very little activity, and cell 3 shows an increase in action potentials."
"Whereas the ‘Lavender’ odor only causes a response in cell 2. The ‘Mint’ odor causes very little activity in cell 1, and increased activity in both cell 2 and cell 3. Lastly, the ‘Rose’ odor causes an increase in activity in cell 1 and cell 2, but very little activity in cell 3."
"These recordings demonstrate that a single odorant can cause changes in activity in more than one type of olfactory receptor neuron, due to the receptor proteins recognizing more than one type of molecular feature of the odorant molecules. After the odorant binds to the odorant receptor protein, the receptor activates an associated G protein called Golf. This protein complex is 90% similar to the stimulatory G protein Gs , and likewise triggers activation of adenylyl cyclase, elevating the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP."
"cAMP binds to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels that when opened, allow for the influx of calcium and sodium. The influx of calcium opens calcium-activated chloride channels. Olfactory receptor neurons have high intracellular chloride concentration, so the opening of the chloride channel results in chloride flowing out of the cell."
"Together, this causes the olfactory receptor neuron to depolarize, leading to membrane depolarization within the dendrite. This change in membrane potential is called a “receptor potential”. If depolarization crosses threshold potential within the olfactory receptor neuron cell body, then the olfactory receptor neuron will fire action potentials down its axons that make up the olfactory nerve toward the olfactory bulb."
"Olfactory receptor neurons encode the intensity of smells through the frequency of action potential firing, which changes in accordance with the concentration of odorant molecules. Imagine standing over a fresh-baked pizza and inhaling deeply. Due to the high concentration of odorant molecules in the air, several receptors will be activated, leading to frequent neuronal firing."
"Now, imagine you are down the block from a pizza restaurant, getting only a slight whiff of those same scents. Here, the concentration of odorants is low, meaning that the Olfactory receptor neurons fire less frequently. Because odorants are found in the air, they are highly mobile and can easily diffuse away, no longer having the ability to activate odorant receptor proteins."
"Olfactory signaling can also be terminated through the activity of enzymes located within the mucus of the olfactory epithelium. Our perception of smells can also fade, even if the odorant is still present in the air. The odorant receptor neurons can adapt to the presence of an odorant, and thus no longer signal its presence."
"The axons of the olfactory receptor neurons pass through the skull through a tiny series of holes at the cribriform plate. These primary neurons form synaptic connections onto neurons in the olfactory bulb called mitral cells, forming the beginning of the olfactory nerve . Like the optic nerve, the olfactory nerve runs along the ventral surface of the brain."
"The site of synaptic connectivity between the olfactory receptor neurons and the secondary neurons in the olfactory bulb  is a highly specialized clump of tissue called a glomerulus. The typical human has a little under 2,000 glomeruli, and each glomerulus only receives inputs from olfactory receptor neurons that express the same type of odorant receptor proteins. This means that even through the olfactory receptor neurons that express the same type of odorant receptor protein are spread out throughout the olfactory epithelium, the axons of those neurons all converge within the same glomerulus."
"Axons leave the olfactory bulb via the olfactory tracts and project to two different targets. First, some cells project to the olfactory tubercle, are routed through the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and then to the orbitofrontal cortex. This pathway is responsible for our conscious perception of smell."
"Other cells project directly to the olfactory cortex and other related structures found within the temporal lobes, like the hippocampus. This makes the olfactory system the only sensory system that does not have to first pass signals through the thalamus before cortical processing. This pathway may play roles in discriminating odors, and the emotional, motivational, and memory-related aspects of smell."
"Like other sensory systems, the structures involved in olfaction can be injured. An injury to the olfactory system can result in hyposmia, a reduced ability to smell, or anosmia, a complete loss of smell. The most common insult to the olfactory system is simple nasal congestion, a temporary, physical blockage of the entry to the nasal cavity that decreases airflow and, therefore, the number of particles that reach the olfactory epithelium."
"Congestion can be caused by allergies, the common cold, upper respiratory bacterial or viral infections, or sinus infections. Hyposmia is also one of the main neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Hyposmia is common among healthy, older adults, affecting about half of the population between 65 and 80 years old."
"As a person ages, spontaneous calcification causes the holes in the cribriform plate to shrink, which can impinge on and damage olfactory receptor neuron axons. Hyposmia can also be caused by abrupt head injuries. The olfactory receptor neuron axons that project through the holes of the cribriform plate are particularly sensitive to blows to the head."
"Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, contribute to smell deficiency. Usually, hyposmia precedes the major clinically observed symptoms of these disorders, hinting that smell deficiency may serve as an early diagnostic biomarker. Another olfactory deficit, phantosmia, is when a person perceives “phantom” scents, or in other words, experiences an olfactory hallucination."
"Phantosmia may be triggered by a temporal lobe seizure or a stroke. It can also be caused by a brain tumor affecting the olfactory nerve , or the subsequent surgical removal of the tumor, leading to injury. Schizophrenia, a psychiatric condition characterized by auditory hallucinations, may also cause phantosmia."
"All somatosensory receptor neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion, a structure found just outside the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. The receptor neurons, also called primary afferent fibers, of the somatosensory system are bipolar neurons, meaning they have one process from the cell body that splits into two branches. One travels to the location of the receptor  via the spinal nerves, and one travels into the spinal cord at the dorsal horn via the dorsal root."
"The axon can either synapse in the spinal cord or ascend to the brain in the dorsal column. Primary afferent axons are divided into four groups based on size and conduction speed. The groups, unfortunately, have different names depending on if the axons come from the skin  or the muscles ."
"The fastest axons are the Aα or Group I type; they have the largest diameter and are heavily myelinated. The next fastest myelinated axons are the Aβ or Group II fibers, followed by the Aδ or Group III fibers. Finally, the C fibers have the smallest diameter, are unmyelinated, and are the slowest at conducting action potentials."
Different sensory information is sent via the different types of axons. Proprioceptive information from the skeletal muscles is sent to the spinal cord via Group I fibers. Touch information from the mechanoreceptors travels along Aβ fibers.
"Aδ fibers carry pain and temperature sensation, and C fibers convey information about pain, temperature, itch, and chemoreception. The afferent axons from the dorsal root ganglion enter the spinal cord via the spinal nerves. Axons from nearby regions of the body enter the spinal cord together, and this forms regions of skin that are innervated by the same spinal nerve."
These regions are called dermatomes. Damage to a spinal nerve will cause dysfunction along the innervated dermatome. The dermatomes and spinal nerves are divided into 4 groups.
"The seven cervical spinal segments are the most rostral and are located in the neck. The twelve thoracic spinal segments are located along the chest and abdomen. The five lumbar segments are located below the thoracic segments, and the five sacral segments are the most caudal."
"Touch can come in many forms: pressure, vibration, stretch, motion, edges, points, etc. Receptors in the skin allow for perception of these different characteristics, and when this information is combined in the central nervous system, we are able to determine the location, strength, duration, movement, shape, and texture of the object interacting with the skin. Cutaneous  mechanoreceptors are responsible for sensing mechanical changes to the skin."
"We can feel different modalities of touch because of the presence of specialized sensory receptors, called mechanoreceptors, located in the skin. There are four different classes of cutaneous mechanoreceptors. These different mechanoreceptors have slightly different shapes and are therefore capable of detecting different types of stimuli."
Merkel’s discs are located at the border between the dermis and epidermis and are specialized to detect edges and points. They are very densely populated underneath our fingertips. These are the most precise mechanoreceptors with resolution at the level of 0.
"5 mm, which allow us to detect different distances in bumps while running your fingers across Braille. Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors wrapped in several layers of connective tissue. The Pacinian corpuscles are located deep in the dermis of the skin and are responsible for perception of vibrations."
Meissner’s corpuscles are located in the epidermis layer and are highly concentrated at the fingertips. They are stimulated by skin motion/movement. Ruffini endings are located in the dermis layer of the skin and respond to stretching of the skin.
"The somatosensory afferents from the cutaneous mechanoreceptor have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion , a clump of somata that are close to the dorsal side of the spinal cord. These touch receptors are the primary neurons and are classified as pseudounipolar neurons based on their morphology. Pseudounipolar neurons don’t have true dendrites; instead each soma sends a single protrusion which branches into two directions."
"One branch goes towards the skin surface where it terminates as one of the mechanoreceptors. Typically, the terminal of this branch is surrounded by a connective tissue covering. The other branch off the soma travels towards the spinal cord."
"On a molecular scale, these mechanoreceptors detect changes at the skin using mechanically-gated ion channels. In previous chapters we discussed ion channels that are gated by voltage changes and channels that are gated by neurotransmitters. In the somatosensory system, we find ion channels that are gated by physical distortion or stretch of the membrane."
"These transmembrane proteins are specialized for detecting the physical distortion of the channel and can open by stretch of the membrane itself or indirectly through movement of intra- or extracellular proteins that are linked to the channels. They are specialized for detecting the physical distortion of the channel, similar to the channels found in the stereocilia of the hair cells or vestibular cells. When pressure is applied to these proteins, the cation channel opens and sodium and calcium flow down their electrochemical gradient into the neuron, causing both a depolarization and the initiation of second messenger cascades."
"This depolarization is referred to as a ‘receptor potential’. If enough stimulus is applied, the depolarization reaches threshold potential for the cell and an action potential is sent toward the spinal cord. Each cutaneous mechanoreceptor is able to detect somatosensory information in an area of skin called the receptive field."
"When the receptive field is touched, the mechanoreceptor will be activated. The size of a receptive field can be determined by measuring the rate of action potentials from the nerve that collects somatosensory information from that patch of skin. The smaller the receptive field, the better the brain can distinguish between two different adjacent tactile stimuli."
"Additionally, different classes of mechanoreceptors have different sizes of receptive fields: deeper structures, like Pacinian corpuscles, have larger receptive fields compared to receptors found closer to the skin surface that have smaller receptive fields. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles, both of which are located near the skin surface, have small receptive fields and thus collect information from a restricted area of sensory space. Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles, located deeper in the skin layers, have larger receptive fields than the Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles and thus collect information over a large are of sensory space."
"Receptive field sizes are different among the different mechanoreceptors, but they also vary among different body regions. Even within one receptor type , receptive fields in regions like the fingers or lips are smaller than in regions like the back or leg. This allows us to have finer spatial resolution with locating and identifying objects using our fingers."
The smaller receptive fields in these regions are a result of a higher density of receptors in the skin. Receptive field sizes are important because they allow us to locate a stimulus on our bodies. Larger receptive fields are not as precise as smaller receptive fields.
"One measure of receptive field size is two-point discrimination , which determines the minimum distance needed between two stimuli to perceive two separate points on the skin and not one. The hand has a smaller threshold for discerning between two points than does the back, a result of the different sized in receptive fields. In skin areas with a large receptive field, two adjacent stimuli may feel like one."
"Skin areas with small receptive fields are better able to distinguish two similarly-spaced points. The hand has a smaller threshold for discerning between two points than does the back, a result of the different sized in receptive fields. The two-point discrimination threshold for the fingers is very small, which indicates that they have high sensitivity."
"Body areas with high sensitivity typically have higher density of mechanoreceptors, have receptors that have smaller receptive fields, and have more brain tissue devoted to processing the sensory information that comes from those structures. The two-point discrimination threshold for areas such as the leg or torso is very large, which indicates that these areas have low sensitivity. Body areas with low sensitive have a lower density of mechanoreceptors, have receptors that have larger receptive fields, and have less brain tissue devoted to sensory information that comes from those structures."
"Another important characteristic of the somatic sensory receptors is that of adaptation rate. The class of mechanoreceptors can be divided into two categories based on their electrical properties in response to stimuli: slowly adapting and rapidly-adapting. Slowly-adapting mechanoreceptors change their action potential firing rate as long as the stimulus is present, while rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors only change activity at the moment there is a change in stimulus."
"For example, imagine the stimulus of a coin that is sitting in the palm of your hand. The slowly-adapting sensory neurons may increase their firing rate as long as the coin is in your palm. When the quarter is removed, they return to their baseline firing rate."
"Slowly-adapting mechanoreceptors change their action potential firing rate as long as the stimulus is present and are most useful for determining the pressure and shape of a stimulus. Merkel cells and Ruffini endings are both slowly adapting fibers. Rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors only change activity at the moment there is a change in stimulus, but not when a stimulus is constant."
"This firing makes rapidly adapting fibers specialized for detecting movement and vibration. Considering the coin example from above, a rapidly adapting sensory neuron will change its action potential firing properties only at two timepoints: the moment the coin lands in your hand, and the moment that coin is removed. These neurons signal a change in status."
"The receptive fields of the sensory neurons become more complex as information moves up the pathway. We saw in the last lesson that mechanoreceptors have receptive fields that, when touched, activate the neuron. The mechanoreceptors synapse on neurons in the dorsal column, and those neurons have more complex receptive fields."
"The dorsal column nuclei have receptive fields that are divided into center and surround regions. The center of the receptive field is a result of direct innervation from the mechanoreceptors. If a stimulus touches the skin in the center of a dorsal column neuron’s receptive field, the neuron will increase its firing rate."
The center / surround structure is like that of bipolar and ganglion cells in the vision system. The surround region of the receptive field is a result of indirect communication between the receptor neurons and the dorsal column neurons via inhibitory interneurons. The surround has an inhibitory effect on the dorsal column neuron.
"If a stimulus touches the skin in the surround of a dorsal column neuron’s receptive field, the neuron will decrease its firing rate. The center-surround structure of the receptive field is critical for lateral inhibition to occur. Lateral inhibition is the ability of the sensory systems to enhance the perception of edges of stimuli."
"At a point or an edge of a stimulus, because of the inhibitory interneurons, the perceived stimulus strength will be enhanced compared to the actual stimulus strength. The pathway from the periphery to the somatosensory cortex consists of three neurons: a first-order sensory neuron, a second-order medulla neuron, and a third-order thalamic neuron. Specifically, the primary afferent sensory fibers  have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion, a structure that lies just outside of the spinal cord."
"The axons of these first-order neurons enter the ipsilateral dorsal side of the spinal cord. Some axon collaterals terminate in the spinal cord and are important for reflexes. The main axon branch ascends the spinal cord toward the brain, via the dorsal column, synapsing in the dorsal column nuclei located in the medulla of the brainstem."
"The axons of sensory neurons in the lower body remain separate from the axons of sensory neurons in the upper body throughout the pathway. These two populations of neurons synapse in different regions of the medulla. The lower body axons synapse in the gracile nucleus, whereas the upper body axons synapse in cuneate nucleus."
"The second-order neurons within the medulla have axons that cross the midline, or decussate, and ascend via a white matter tract called the medial lemniscus. The medulla axons synapse in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. The third-order thalamic neurons then project to the primary somatosensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe."
"The pathway from the face and head to the somatosensory cortex also consists of three neurons. Sensory receptors in the face and head send information to the brain via cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve. The first-order neurons have their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, located just outside of the brainstem, and they project to the ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus in the pons."
The second-order neurons within the pons cross the midline and project up to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. These third-order thalamic neurons then send projections to the face region of the somatosensory cortex. The primary somatosensory cortex is the postcentral gyrus located in the parietal lobe.
"It is divided into four regions, each with its own input and function: areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2. The neurons within these regions are arranged in columns, similar to other areas of the cortex. Most touch information from mechanoreceptors inputs to region 3b, whereas most proprioceptive information from the muscles inputs to region 3a."
"These regions then send and receive information from areas 1 and 2. As processing of somatosensory information continues, the stimuli required to activate neurons becomes more complex. For example, area 1 is involved in sensing texture, and area 2 is involved in sensing size and shape of an object."
"The posterior parietal cortex, an important output region of the somatosensory cortex, lies caudal to the postcentral gyrus; areas 5 and 7 are downstream structures that continue to process touch. The receptive fields of each higher order neuron increases in size and complexity, but even cortical neurons are associated with a specific region of the body. The mapping of this organization was discovered during brain surgery."
"In epilepsy surgery, parts of the operation are performed as the person is awake. The famed neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield electrically stimulated a small section of the primary somatosensory cortex , then asked the person what they felt. Patients would respond that they feel sensations in their hand when the medial S1 was activated, the little finger when a more ventral area was activated, and so on."
"In repeating this process while moving slowly across the span of S1, Penfield mapped out the organization of S1. He discovered that the sensory and motor cortices are organized by the region of the body they represent, so neurons that respond to sensation in the fingers are located close to the neurons that respond to sensation in the hand. One key observation in doing this process was the volume of brain regions corresponding to different body parts was not necessarily proportional to the volume of skin: for example, a large portion of the cortex was dedicated to sensory information from the lips or the fingertips, while very little was dedicated to the shoulders or trunk."
"This observation indicates that certain areas of the body are more densely packed  with sensory neurons compared to others . Regions with high receptor density in the skin, and, therefore, fine two-point discrimination, have more cortical space devoted to them. This means that the cortical representation of the body is not true to actual physical proportions."
"A homunculus is a cartoon representation of what a body would look like if actual body size was proportional to the cortical representation. The hands and lips would be excessively large while the torso, arms, and legs, would be relatively small. Importantly, most homunculus representations are based on the mapping of male brains, but far less research has been done on the mapping of female brains."
"The primary somatosensory cortex sends projections to other parietal lobe regions for higher-level processing of touch information. The secondary somatosensory cortex  is located in the inferior parietal lobe, just above the lateral fissure. This region, like the dorsal stream of visual processing, is responsible for object recognition, discerning texture, shape, and size."
"The SII also has receptive fields that represent bilateral regions of the body, so both hemispheres will be activated by touch on either side of the body. The SII sends projections to the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. The posterior parietal cortex recognizes touch characteristics like orientation and movement."
"It is also important for combining the touch and motor components of actions like grasping. The posterior parietal cortex outputs to the frontal motor cortex. In adulthood, the brain is plastic, meaning synaptic connections can rearrange under certain conditions."
The somatosensory cortex has been studied with regard to its plasticity. Experience-based plasticity was initially proposed by Donald Hebb and is often referred to as Hebbian plasticity. This theory postulates that experience can enhance or reduce the activity of synapses to ultimately alter their function.
"When a presynaptic neuron repeatedly signals to a postsynaptic neuron, the synapse will undergo plasticity, changing structure to stabilize and strengthen the function of the synapse. Simplistically, the phrase “neurons that fire together, wire together” is often used to describe Hebbian plasticity. Plastic changes can include altering the amount of neurotransmitter release or altering the number of postsynaptic receptors."
Multiple principles of experience-dependent plasticity have been identified to build off Hebb’s original idea. We will focus on five of those principles below. Use it or lose it.
"The idea behind this principle is that neural connections that are used consistently are maintained and strengthened. When a synapse is strengthened, it will produce stronger EPSPs that bring the cell membrane potential closer to threshold potential. If neural connections are not used consistently, then those synapses are removed, or lost."
Use it to improve it. The idea behind this principle is that connections that are consistently used continue to improve in function. Repetition of stimulation.
Synaptic strength can be enhanced by repeated stimulation. Intensity of stimulation. The intensity of the stimulation will alter synaptic strength.
"Regional and functional specificity. Experience-dependent plasticity is specific to the region and function that is receiving the experience. This is to say, providing specific experience to one region of the brain will enhance plasticity within that one region, and will not globally enhance plasticity across the entire brain."
"Michael Merzenich is a researcher that has enlightened our understanding of cortical plasticity within the somatosensory system. He used microelectrodes to stimulate and record from the somatosensory cortex to create detailed cortical maps, similar to the homunculus that we discussed earlier. Dr."
"Merzenich completed a number of experiments that demonstrated principles of experience-dependent plasticity, some of which are highlighted below. In one of his experiment, he demonstrated that amputation or loss of a finger, for example, will lead to the associated cortical space to be functionally remapped by input from neighboring regions of the hand. The cortical neurons do not die, they begin to be activated by a different region of the body."
"An additional experiment showed that when two adjacent fingers were sewn together so that they moved as a unit, a new cortical map developed that was specific to the merged fingers. Thus, cortical maps can be removed or created anew. Likewise, cortical representation can expand with use or practice."
"Repeated training of certain fingers can lead to an increase in cortical space mapped to those digits. Pain is a complex experience that has somatosensory, psychological, and affective components. Nociception is a sensory process that provides signals that trigger pain when in the presence of a noxious stimulus."
"Detection and avoidance of pain is a highly-adaptive behavior that can improve the odds of survival chances of an animal. When we feel pain, we are more likely to protect the injured site to prevent further damage, making the sensation of pain beneficial to our overall well-being. Pain detection is carried out by nociceptors that are located in the periphery at the surface of the skin."
"Nociceptors can detect a variety of noxious stimuli, ranging from crush , acid , and high heat . They are expressed on free nerve endings that innervate the skin. Many pain-detecting neurons respond to more than one type of noxious stimulus and are called polymodal nociceptors."
"These free nerve endings are found closest to the surface of the skin when compared to other mechanoreceptors. Similar to other somatosensory mechanoreceptors, the sensory end of the pseudounipolar neurons have their cell soma in the dorsal root ganglion. When a nociceptor is activated, it causes the opening of mechanically-gated ion channels that allow for cation influx, resulting in cell depolarization."
"Once depolarization occurs in response to a painful stimulus, action potential propagation depends on the action of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. Lidocaine, a common local anesthetic, dulls pain by blocking these voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing signal transmission. A special type of sodium channel, Na1."
"7, is present only in nociceptor fibers. A mutation in this ion channel that prevents it from functioning can results in the inability to feel pain. Activation of nociceptors usually occurs in response to tissue damage or the threat of damage."
"Depending on the type of stimulus, either Aδ fibers or C fibers are activated to transmit information to the CNS. Nociceptors are located throughout the body in skin, muscles, and viscera, but there are no nociceptors in the CNS. The Aδ fibers have small receptive fields which allows for precise location of pain."
"They are lightly myelinated, smaller in diameter , and transmit signals slower than the Aβ fibers that transmit touch information, around ~25 m/s. There are 2 types of Aδ fibers. Type Aδ I fibers have a low threshold for mechanical stimulation and activate following intense pressure or an incision on the skin."
"Type Aδ II fibers have a low threshold for thermal stimulation and activate in extremely hot or extremely cold environments. Type C fibers tend to be polymodal and are activated by a range of stimuli including mechanical, chemical, and thermal. They have larger receptive fields, which results in a lower ability to locate pain."
The unmyelinated C fibers have an even smaller diameter  and slower conduction velocity  than the Aδ fibers. The C fibers carry upwards of 70% of noxious signals within the body. The Aδ and C fibers transmit information to the CNS at different speeds because of their different myelination levels.
"We can often perceive this difference in the form of “first pain” and “second pain”. Think about a time where you were injured, perhaps you hit your thumb with a hammer. Immediately, you might have felt an intense, sharp, and localized pain – first pain, but then a milder, burning or aching pain, that was more widespread that continue longer – second pain."
"The myelinated Aδ fibers are responsible for first pain transmission whereas the unmyelinated C fibers are responsible for second pain transmission. Primary afferent pain fibers have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion, like the fibers of the mechanoreceptors responsible for touch. The axons of these first-order neurons enter the ipsilateral dorsal side of the spinal cord, and then they branch and travel up and down the spinal cord a couple of segments in a white matter region of the spinal cord just posterior to the dorsal horn called Lissauer’s tract."
All the branches terminate in the dorsal horn. The primary pain afferents coming from the periphery release glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These afferents can also release the neuropeptide Substance P following periods of high stimulation.
"The nociceptor fibers  make synaptic contact with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These neurons immediately cross the midline, or decussate, and then ascend to the brain through the anteriolateral aspect of the spinal cord and brainstem via the spinothalamic tract. The axons terminate in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus."
"The thalamic neurons  then project to the primary somatosensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe. Like the touch pathway , the pain pathway  is made up of three neurons that ultimately transmit the sensory information to the appropriate area of the cortex. The first order neuron is the sensory nociceptor neuron, the second order neuron is located within the spinal cord, and the third order neuron is located in the thalamus, that extends out to the primary somatosensory cortex."
"Nociceptors in the face and head send info to the brain primarily through cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve. The first-order neurons have their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, located just outside of the brainstem. The fibers enter the brainstem and descend to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla, where they synapse on a second-order neuron."
"The second-order neurons cross the midline and project up to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons then send projections to the face region of the somatosensory cortex. In summary, the touch pathway  and the pain pathway  are made up of three neurons that ultimately transmit the sensory information between the periphery and the appropriate area of the cortex."
"Because the sensations of touch and pain decussate at different levels of the CNS as they ascend to the primary somatosensory cortex for processing, damage to only one half of the spinal cord will result in a condition referred to as dissociated sensory loss. Ipsilateral to and below the damaged half of the spinal cord, individuals will have decreased touch sensation but normal pain sensation. Contralateral to and below the damaged half of the spinal cord, there will be normal touch sensation, but decreased pain sensation."
Sensation above the damage will be unchanged. One of the warning signs that a person is having a heart attack is perception of pain in the shoulders or medial aspect of the left arm. This sensation is called referred pain: the feeling of pain at a site separate from where an injury is located.
"Referred pain happens when the nervous system is unclear about how to process signals from an internal organ, and the brain interprets those afferent signals as bodily pain. Injury at different internal organs cause different patterns of somatic pain: liver injury may present as pain in the shoulder blades, lung cancer sometimes causes shoulder pain, and kidney stones can cause pain in the lower back, abdomen, and sides. Even the headache-like pain you get from a “brain freeze” from drinking cold liquids too quickly is a form of referred pain."
"It is unclear what causes referred pain. The convergence projection theory suggests that the afferent projections from the internal organs and the nociceptive somatosensory neurons of the skin form synapses onto the same population of spinothalamic tract secondary neurons. When these secondary neurons project towards the brain, there is no ability to differentiate the origin of the signal coming from the primary neuron."
"The central sensitization theory suggests that the neurons of the spinal cord change in their excitability threshold with prolonged exposure to injurious stimuli. So, when an injured internal organ repeatedly sends signals into the secondary neurons, a host of neurotransmitters cause sensitization of the nociceptive signaling, which are now activated under non-noxious conditions. In healthy individuals, nociceptors that detect pain send those signals into the spinal cord."
"But in people experiencing allodynia, noninjurious tactile stimuli, such as strands of hair brushing across your forehead or the feeling of a shirt resting on your shoulders, cause the sensation of pain. Diabetes, physical trauma, or postherpetic neuralgia may cause allodynia. Drugs that modify the action potential firing properties of the afferent somatosensory pathway, such as topical anesthetics  or calcium channel antagonists, can help relieve the pain."
"A related disorder is hyperalgesia, an abnormally heightened perception and increased persistence of pain. When you experience a cut on your finger, and the area surrounding the cut is reddened and painful, that is the area of hyperalgesia. Both allodynia and hyperalgesia can be the result of sensitization, where repeated firing of the neurons increase action potential firing of pain neurons."
"Sensitization within this system can lead to functional and structural changes wherein weak stimuli that previously did not cause pain will now result in pain perception. Sensitization can occur in first-order, second-order, or third-order neurons within the pain pathway. Allodynia and hyperalgesia can be symptoms of neuropathic pain, a broad category of pain conditions resulting from damage to the nervous system."
"People experiencing pain even in the absence of pain-producing stimuli may be diagnosed with chronic pain. Chronic pain may be localized or widespread, affecting large areas of the body at once. Up to 10% of the global population may experience chronic pain, and a variety of risk factors contribute, from advanced age, being male, low socioeconomic status, unhealthy lifestyles, and a history of surgical intervention."
"Chronic pain can lead to significantly shorter lifespans and may contribute to the opioid misuse epidemic. A philosophically-opposite condition is called congenital insensitivity to pain . People with CIP are incapable of perceiving pain, no matter how severe."
"CIP is a rare genetic condition that is observed from birth. People with CIP have significantly shorter lifespans since they do not sense that their bodies may be injured and may not learn to avoid exposure to damaging stimuli. Some patients may walk for days on a compound fracture of the shin bone, or never even notice that their back is broken."
"CIP is associated with mutations in the SCN9A gene, which codes for a component of the voltage-gated sodium channels that are expressed in nociceptors. Individuals can have horrible injuries, yet not experience any pain in the moment. How can this occur?"
"One theory for how this is accomplished is ‘The Gate Control Theory of pain modulation’ which postulates that there are descending pathways that start in the brain and signal to the spinal cord that acts to inhibit, or “gate”, the pain signals from ascending to the brain and being perceived as pain. One brain area implicated in this pathway is the periaqueductal gray  matter within the midbrain. Neurons with their cell bodies within the PAG have axons that descend to the Raphe nuclei within the medulla."
"The raphe nuclei neurons then descend the spinal cord and release serotonin onto the second-order spinal pain neuron. The second-order pain neuron is therefore receiving synapses from both the first-order pain neuron that is transmitting the pain signal from the periphery and the raphe nuclei neuron carrying the descending signal from the CNS. The serotonin released by the raphe nuclei neuron acts to inhibit activity of the second-order pain neuron, thereby inhibiting the pain signal from ascending to the brain."
"In what situations do the PAG neurons ‘gate’ the pain signals from ascending to the brain and being perceived as pain? That answer is less clear, though we do understand that the gating of the pain signal eventually stops and the pain is able to be perceived. The experience of pain can be altered through drugs that interact with the brain."
"An analgesic decreases pain without a loss of consciousness, whereas central anesthetics cause a loss of consciousness and completely eliminate all incoming sensory experiences, including pain and somatosensory information. Opioids are drugs that are very effective at short-term pain relief. They are derived from the poppy plant and include opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, and analogues of those substances."
"Opioids bind strongly to several types of opioid receptors  that are located throughout the brain, with especially high receptor density in areas such as the PAG, raphe nuclei, and in the spinal cord. Antagonists for opioid receptors block the effects of opioids and include drugs like naloxone and naltrexone. The brain also makes its own endogenous opioids including endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins, that bind to these same receptors within the brain."
"Endogenous opioids are involved in various functions within the brain including nociception, respiration, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, food intake, learning and memory, and many others. When opioids  bind to their receptors, they modulate incoming pain information and provide temporary pain relief. Opioids are known to have effects on mood and can produce euphoric feelings."
"Unfortunately, they also have several side effects, most notably drug tolerance and dependence. Individuals that have undergone amputation of a limb can experience ‘phantom limbs’, which give the sensory experience that the amputated limb is still present. In these cases, the sensory neurons can no longer provide sensory or pain information from the amputated limb, yet somatosensory and pain perception persists."
"Some individuals that experience phantom limbs can also experience phantom limb pain, where pain is experienced in a limb that has been removed. Many physicians believed that phantom limbs were caused by irritation of nerve endings that remained in the limb stump after amputation. However, the research by the neuroscientist Dr."
V. S. Ramachandran demonstrated that cortical plasticity played a major role in producing phantom limbs.
"Specifically, Dr. Ramachandran believed that cortical plasticity within the somatosensory cortex was responsible for the sensation of phantom limbs. He hypothesized that adjacent somatosensory maps within the cortex blurred together following amputation, causing the brain to rewire in the absence of incoming sensory information."
The following case study demonstrated this somatosensory reorganization following amputation. Dr. Ramachandran worked with an individual named Tom Sorenson that had lost an arm in a car accident.
"Tom was experiencing an itch on his phantom arm that he could not scratch. Due to the fact that the cortical maps for the face and the arm are adjacent to each other within the somatosensory cortex, Ramachandran methodically used a swab to stroke different areas of Tom’s face. Tom reported that in certain areas of his face, he could also feel the swab on his phantom limb."
"Functional brain scans confirmed that the maps for the face and the arm had blurred together. Ramachandran believes that phantom limb pain stems from a “learned paralysis” that occurs when an individual sends out a motor command to move a phantom limb but receives no proprioceptive or visual confirmation that the phantom limb has moved. After this experience is repeated, the brain wires in such a way that it learns that the phantom limb does not move, leading to feelings of paralysis and pain associated with the phantom limb."
"To treat this “learned paralysis” in the phantom, Ramachandran developed mirror box therapy. In mirror box therapy, an amputee uses a mirror to produce a reflection of the intact limb opposite the amputated limb. By looking at this reflection, the individual experiences visual feedback that the amputated limb is intact and can now move."
"Looking at the movement of the “phantom” limb in the mirror, provides powerful input to the nervous system and acts to alleviate the feelings of paralysis and pain associated with the phantom limb, and effectively “unlearn” the paralysis and feelings of pain. The motor system refers to the nerve cells that are used to control our body. The key roles of the motor system are to plan, control, and execute voluntary  movements, and to control involuntary  functions, such as digesting food."
"The motor system is sometimes described as a top-down process: in a voluntary movement, neural activity in the frontal lobe sends commands down to motor neurons located in the brainstem or spinal cord, which in turn activate muscle groups. In reality, motor control is more of a loop, rapidly communicating between the sensory cortex and motor cortex. Sensory information about limb position, posture, and objects in contact with the skin inform the descending motor plan."
"Simultaneously, the motor plan provides predictions about upcoming movement. There are multiple levels of control. Within the spinal cord, simple reflexes can function without higher input from the brain."
"Slightly more complex spinal control occurs when central pattern generators function during repetitive movements like walking. The motor and premotor cortices in the brain are responsible for the planning and execution of voluntary movements. And finally, the basal ganglia and cerebellum modulate the responses of the neurons in the motor cortex to help with coordination, motor learning, and balance."
This lesson explores the lowest level of control at the level of the spinal cord. Muscle fibers are innervated by alpha motor neurons. Alpha motor neurons are also called lower motor neurons because they are not located in higher brain areas.
These cells are the only cells that directly command muscle contraction. The cell bodies of the alpha motor neurons are located in the central nervous system in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons leave the spinal cord via the ventral roots and travel to the muscle via efferent peripheral spinal nerves.
"Like the sensory systems, the motor system is also organized in a topographic fashion, referred to as ‘somatotopic organization’. Within the spinal cord, alpha motor neurons that innervate muscles in the arms and legs are located in the lateral portion of the ventral horn, whereas alpha motor neurons that innervate muscles in the trunk are located in the medial portion. The structure of the spinal cord is reviewed in Chapter 26."
Examining cross sections of the spinal cord at different levels reveals that there is a non-uniform distribution of lower motor neurons. This is determined by the size of the ventral horn at the different levels of the spinal cord. At the cervical enlargement the larger ventral horns are due to the presence of more lower motor neurons that function in movement of the arms.
"At the lumbar enlargement the larger ventral horns are due to the presence of more lower motor neurons that function in movement of the legs. The lower motor neurons communicate with muscle fibers  at the neuromuscular junction . The NMJ is similar to other chemical synapses, however the postsynaptic cell is a muscle cell separated by about 30 nm."
"The presynaptic cell is the motor neuron and the postsynaptic site is the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of the long cylindrical muscle fibers . The neuromuscular junction is one of the largest synapses in the body and one of the most well-studied because of its peripheral location. The neuromuscular junction is located midway down the length of the muscle fiber."
"The muscle fiber will contract in response to depolarization traveling down the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. The synapse is located midway down the length of the muscle fiber so that the postsynaptic signal can travel in both directions down the long muscle fiber and quickly activate a contraction along the entire cell. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction , and it acts upon ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are present in postjunctional folds of the muscle fiber."
"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors allow the influx of sodium ions into the muscle cell. The depolarization will cause nearby voltage-gated channels to open and fire an action potential in the muscle fiber. In a healthy system, an action potential in the motor neurons always causes an action potential in the muscle cell."
"The action potential leads to contraction of the muscle fiber. To review, an action potential traveling down the motor neuron  will cause the release of acetylcholine into the synapse. Acetylcholine binds to postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are located in the folded sarcolemma , causing depolarization of muscle fibers and ultimately muscle contraction."
"Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and terminates its action, is present in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. Muscle contraction must be tightly controlled. Thus, the actions of acetylcholinesterase are very important to cease muscle contraction quickly."
"Myasthenia gravis  is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness, resulting in difficulty with speech, trouble with movement and swallowing, drooping eyelids, and double vision. Each year, an estimated 20 out of a million people get diagnosed with MG. The muscle weakness seen in MG results from immune system-mediated destruction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed at the NMJ."
"Thus, when the lower motor neuron releases acetylcholine, the muscle cells are unable to detect this release, so they fail to contract appropriately. One therapeutic strategy involves inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This causes the synaptic acetylcholine to remain in the synapse longer, increasing the chance that receptors get activated."
"Alternatively, autoimmune diseases like MG can be improved with immunosuppressant therapy. With successful treatment, MG usually does not result in changes in lifespan. Importantly, there are many more muscles cells than there are motor neurons."
One alpha motor neuron can innervate multiple fibers within one muscle due to the branching of motor neuron axons. Each axon terminal synapses  a single muscle fiber. A motor neuron and all the fibers innervated by it are called a motor unit.
"The muscle fibers within one motor unit are often spread throughout the muscle to spread the contraction throughout the full muscle. Further, motor units in a muscle usually contract asynchronously to help protect the muscle from fatigue. A graded contraction of the muscle is produced by activating varying numbers of motor units."
"Motor units differ in size. Small motor units are motor units that innervate fewer muscle fibers and thus control fine movements. Small motor units are located in the eyes and fingers, both of which function in fine and precise movements."
"Large motor units innervate many muscle fibers and are typically found in weight-bearing muscles like the thighs. The group of motor neurons that innervate all the fibers of one muscle is called a motor pool. In addition to the size of the motor unit, the types of muscle fibers that are innervated by motor units can also differ."
There are three different types of motor units:  Slow motor units. Slow motor units are slow to contract and generate less force but can work for a long time. They are used in endurance exercise like jogging.
"Fast fatigue-resistant motor units. Fast fatigue-resistant motor units are quick to contract . These motor units generate more force that then slow motor units, but are much more resistant to fatigue than the fast fatigable motor units."
Fast fatigable motor units. Fast fatigable motor units are quickest to contract and generate the most force. These motor units are more prone to fatigue due to decreased number of mitochondria within the muscles.
"Fast fatigable motor units generate a lot of force quickly, but also tire quickly. They are used mostly in high intensity exercise like lifting weights and sprinting. When an action potential is triggered in a muscle it causes a muscle twitch  that is followed by a period of relaxation."
"A muscle twitch shows an increase in tension after a short delay . During the contraction period, the muscle tension increased, and then has a long relaxation period, causing the muscle tension to be increased long after the initial stimulus. When a stimulus occurs during the long relaxation period following a muscle twitch, the newly generated muscle twitch will summate to increase the strength of the overall muscle contraction."
"Shortening the time between stimuli will result in unfused tetanus and if stimuli are very close together will result in fused tetanus. Therefore, a higher rate of action potentials in the alpha motor neuron will generate more muscle contraction. In addition to the rate of action potentials changing the force of the muscle contraction, muscle recruitment can also increase the strength of contraction within a muscle."
"When generating motor activity, the smallest motor units will be activated to contract first due to their size and increased excitability to move the load. Increasingly larger motor units are recruited to lift heavier loads. Recruitment of motor units allows for us to generate appropriate muscle tension to move a given load."
"For example, if you need to pick up a pencil, then we do not need to use the same force as if we were trying to pick up a 20-pound weight. Only smaller motor units would be activated to pick up the pencil, and increasingly larger motor units would be recruited to lift the heavier load of the 20-pound weight. The alpha motor neurons that directly cause muscle contraction receive inputs from three different sources."
Sensory cells from the dorsal root ganglion that provide sensory information from the muscles through proprioception. Upper motor neurons from the motor cortex in the brain and brain stem that are responsible for initiating voluntary movement. Interneurons in the spinal cord.
"These represent the largest input to the alpha motor neurons and can either provide excitation or inhibition to the alpha motor neuron. Raise your arms above your head. Even without seeing your arms, your nervous system has mechanisms that inform you about the location and position of your body parts, including how much your joints are bent."
"This sense is called proprioception and is critically important for coordinated movement and motor reflexes that contribute to those tiny, rapid adjustments that are made while maintaining balance. Proprioceptive information ascends through the spinal cord and into the brain via the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract. Proprioception is also processed in the primary somatosensory cortex."
Proprioception refers to the “body sense” that informs us about how our bodies are positioned and moving in space. Proprioceptors are receptors that provide proprioception information. There are two main types of proprioceptors:  Muscle spindles measure muscle stretch  and transmit this sensory information via 1a sensory afferent fibers.
Muscle spindles are nested within and arranged parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers. Golgi Tendon Organs measure muscle tension and transmit this sensory information via 1b sensory afferent fibers. Golgi tendon organs are located between the extrafusal muscle fibers and their points of attachment at the bone.
Muscle spindles are fibrous capsules that are located within muscles. Intrafusal muscle fibers are special muscle fibers that are located within the fibrous capsule of the muscle spindle. The intrafusal muscle fibers are innervated by gamma motor neurons that will cause them to contract.
"Extrafusal muscle fibers, however, make up the bulk of the muscle and are located outside of the muscle spindle. The extrafusal muscle fibers are stimulated to contract by the alpha motor neurons. Group 1a sensory afferent axons, which have a large diameter and are heavily myelinated, wrap around the intrafusal fibers contained within the muscle spindle."
"These sensory afferent fibers will signal when the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindle are experiencing stretch and communicate information about muscle length. Within the spinal cord, a single sensory 1a afferent axon synapses on every alpha motor neuron within the motor pool that innervates the muscle that contains the muscle spindle. This allows for a fast and powerful contraction of the muscle in response to a change in muscle stretch."
"When the muscle experiences a stretch and the extrafusal fibers are stretched, the muscle spindle and the intrafusal fibers are also stretched . When the muscle spindle stretches, the 1a sensory axon will start to fire action potentials. The sensory axon synapses with an alpha motor neuron that will then cause the extrafusal muscle fibers to contract."
"As the extrafusal fibers contract and the muscle shortens, the muscle spindle goes slack, and the 1a axon will no longer fire action potentials as it is no longer being stretched. The gamma motor neuron is then activated that innervates the intrafusal muscle fibers, causing the intrafusal fibers to contract, allowing the muscle spindle to sense stretch again. Therefore, the gamma motor neuron is critical for allowing the muscle spindle to continue providing information about muscle stretch even when the muscle has experienced contraction."
"The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptor that measures muscle tension, or the force of contraction. They also contribute to our detection of weight, as we lift something heavy for example. Golgi tendon organs are located in the tendon that connects the muscle to bone."
"The tendon is made up of collagen fibrils and the Group 1b sensory axons are intertwined within the collagen fibrils. When the muscle experiences an increase in tension, the collagen fibrils surrounding the 1b sensory axon physically squeeze the 1b axon, opening mechanically-gated ion channels within the 1b sensory axon. The purpose of the Golgi tendon organ is to allow for an optimal range of tension for the muscle and to protect the muscle from injury due to being overloaded."
"This is accomplished through a negative feedback loop controlled by the Golgi tendon organ. When the muscle experiences an increase in muscle tension, the 1b sensory axon starts to fire action potentials. The sensory neuron synapses onto an inhibitory interneuron within the spinal cord, which when active will release GABA onto the alpha motor neuron that innervates the same muscle that experienced the increase in muscle tension to begin with."
"When GABA binds to the alpha motor neuron, it will decrease firing of the alpha motor neuron, leading to a decrease in contraction of the muscle. This is an example of negative feedback as the increased muscle tension ultimately leads to physiological changes that decrease muscle tension. Reflexes are involuntary motor responses that are performed automatically and independent of brain signals ."
"Reflexes involve very simple circuits, sometimes consisting of only two populations of neurons: Sensory information comes in from the periphery, synapsing onto motor neurons in the brainstem or spinal cord. Reflexes can take place as quickly as 1/100th of a second! When a muscle is stretched, this stretches the associated muscle spindle, which activates a 1a sensory afferent neuron that has its cell body located in the dorsal root ganglion. The sensory axon enters the dorsal side of the spinal cord where it makes two synapses:  A direct synapse onto a motor neuron in the spinal cord gray matter."
"The axon of the motor neuron exits the spinal cord and innervates the stretched muscle, causing it to contract. A synapse onto an inhibitory interneuron that then synapses onto a separate motor neuron that innervates the antagonistic muscle. The myotatic reflex, also called the patellar, or knee-jerk reflex, is an example of a stretch reflex and occurs in response to activation of the muscle spindle stretch receptors."
This reflex is commonly tested at a doctor’s visit when the doctor taps your knee with a little hammer. This usually results in the lower leg kicking up slightly. The synaptic communication for this reflex takes place completely within the spinal cord and requires no input from the brain.
"The knee is tapped on the tendon that connects to the quadriceps muscle. The tapping of the tendon stretches the tendon and as a result causes the quadriceps muscle to stretch, activating the stretch receptors. Sensory information travels to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it synapses on alpha motor neurons that innervate the quadriceps muscle."
"Activation of the motor neurons contracts the quadriceps, extending the lower leg. This is called a monosynaptic communication because there is only one synapse between the sensory input and the motor output. The reflexive kick is controlled at the level of the spinal cord and cannot be intentionally suppressed by descending motor pathways no matter how hard you concentrate."
"The sensory neurons also synapse on interneurons within the spinal cord that are inhibitory . These inhibitory interneurons then synapse on alpha motor neurons that innervate the hamstring, the antagonistic flexor muscle to the quadriceps. When these motor neurons are inhibited, the hamstring muscle relaxes, allowing the contraction of the quadriceps to occur with more ease."
"This is called reciprocal inhibition. A similar process can be seen in the withdrawal reflex. In this case, instead of an extension, the muscles lead to muscle flexion in response to a stimulus."
"If, for example, you step on something painful, the reflex will be to lift the injured foot. The sensory information that initiates this reflex is activation of pain receptors, or nociceptors. Like with the stretch reflex, the sensory information enters the spinal cord at the dorsal horn."
"Unlike the stretch reflex, the withdrawal reflex is a polysynaptic reflex, meaning interneurons are present between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. Excitatory interneurons communicate with the alpha motor neurons of the flexor muscle, whereas inhibitory interneurons communicate with the alpha motor neurons of the extensor muscle. The behavioral response is flexing of the leg upward ."
"Running in parallel to the withdrawal reflex is the crossed-extensor reflex. If you step on something sharp and lift that leg, your other leg needs to be able to support your weight shift, or you would fall. This is accomplished by interneurons that cross the midline of the spinal cord and communicate with motor neurons on the contralateral side of the body."
"The painful sensory information that initiated the withdrawal reflex also initiates the crossed-extensor reflex. In addition to the ipsilateral interneurons active in the withdrawal reflex, the sensory axons also synapse on excitatory interneurons that cross the midline. These interneurons then synapse on excitatory interneurons that activate the alpha motor neurons of the extensor muscle and inhibitory interneurons that inhibit the alpha motor neurons of the flexor muscle ."
"This leads to the leg extending, providing a stable base for the weight shift. Central pattern generators  are networks of cells that are capable of producing intrinsic motor responses even in the absence of sensory or brain inputs. These motor responses are usually well-rehearsed, repetitive, and happen at the unconscious level, meaning that certain behavioral outputs can be performed independently of signals upstream in the motor cortex."
"CPGs have been observed in several organisms, ranging from insects, crayfish, birds, and mammals including humans, hinting that their evolution was highly adaptive for survival. Imagine how difficult it would be to survive if every breath required a conscious thought! The CPG is not a standalone driver of motor activity, however. The circuits receive signals from higher brain areas which can modify their characteristics."
"Imagine that you want to consciously hold your breath, or intentionally walk in some unusual or goofy way. In both cases, the descending signals from the brain are able to override the output motor command pattern that the CPG normally produces. Once you stop intentionally changing your motor behavior, the muscles return to their normal activity in response to CPG output."
"Many earlier studies of spinal cord CPGs were conducted in different animal groups with unique locomotor patterns. Mollusks have crawling activity that is rhythmic, fish swim by sending alternative patterns of muscle activity through their body, and birds fly by rhythmic flapping of their wings. In mammals, spinal CPGs were demonstrated in cats with a thoracic-level spinal cord transection."
"Following this surgery, the signals from the brain were unable to be communicated down to the hind legs, eliminating voluntary movement. They exhibited weakened muscular power, but were still able to stand for short times. If their front paws were put onto a stable platform while their hindlegs were put on a moving treadmill, the cat would involuntarily walk to keep up."
"Humans also have CPGs for movement. One remarkable study looked at 37-year-old man who had injured his spinal cord in a football accident as a young man. His injury was at the level of C5, resulting in complete paralysis and a loss of sensation from the neck down."
"Over the following years, he gradually recovered a small amount of function. Fine manipulation skills and bladder bowel control never recovered, and he had not walked unassisted for ten years, experiencing tremendous weakness after taking a few steps. Just days after beginning a physical therapy regimen consisting of assisted upright walking, upon lying down, the man reported alternating muscle flexion and relaxation of the hips, knees, and ankles similar to the pattern of activity seen in locomotion."
"He was unable to voluntarily stop these motions, and could only get some rest by turning to the side. This muscle activity was smooth and rhythmic, as would be seen in a healthy person walking. Some example motor responses driven by CPGs include diaphragm movement , alternating leg swinging and foot flexing , and the progressive contraction of up to 25 pairs of muscles in the tongue and mouth ."
"Some CPGs are located in the brain stem  and others throughout the spinal cord . Locomotion is one example of a basic, rhythmic movement that requires coordination of a number of muscle groups to work properly. Activity of extensor and flexor muscles in both legs must be coordinated to allow smooth locomotion without falling."
"These rhythmical movements are controlled at the level of the spinal cord by circuits called central pattern generators. The spinal cord has circuitry that, in the case of walking, moves the legs in opposite patterns. When one leg is lifting up to move forward, the other leg is stable, touching the ground."
The control of this system has multiple levels. Neurons themselves may have pacemaker properties that allow for a continuous cycle of depolarization and repolarization. These neurons are then located within multi-cell circuits involving a collection of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that results in reciprocal inhibition of contralateral muscles.
"Additional networks of spinal interneurons would cause reciprocal inhibition of ipsilateral antagonistic muscles. Although the spinal cord is able to control these movements on its own, there is input from both the brainstem and sensory neurons which can have an effect on modulating the pattern of neuronal activity in the spinal cord. For example, when an animal needs to slow down, speed up, or turn away from a danger, for example, those inputs can alter the spinal cord circuit."
"All voluntary  movements begin as signals in the brain. Specifically, the neurons involved in motor control are primarily found in the frontal lobe of the telencephalon, which includes areas such as primary motor cortex , premotor cortex, and supplemental motor areas. The posterior parietal cortex also contributes to movement."
"Through this section, we will walk through the brain processes leading to voluntary motor action. There are a number of steps that must take place for voluntary movement to occur. Assessment of the surrounding environment and the body’s location in space, followed by determining what action is appropriate, and then initiating that action."
"For example, after work, you sit down on the couch to watch one episode of your favorite show. As the end credits appear, you realize it is now time to head to your study space and start working on class. To do this, you need to leave the couch, grab your computer from the table, get your coffee from the kitchen and head to a different room."
"All of these voluntary movements take a great deal of processing by the brain. You must assess your surrounding environment and your body’s location in it, determine which actions need to be completed, and then actually initiate those actions. In this chapter we will focus on how the planning of voluntary movement occurs."
"Cortical Anatomy Much of the cortex is actually involved in the planning of voluntary movement. Sensory information, particularly the dorsal stream of the visual and somatosensory pathways, are processed in the posterior parietal lobe where visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information are integrated. The posterior parietal cortex is largely concerned with integrating somatosensory with visual information and determining an appropriate motor action."
"For example, if you were planning to get up from your seat to walk across the room, the posterior parietal cortex would take in the somatosensory proprioceptive information about how your body is positioned, and the visual information from the objects in the room to avoid running into them . With respect to motor control, the prefrontal cortex , located in the front of the brain in the frontal lobe initiates the long-term planning or cognitive aspects of movements. For example, consider the motor actions related to brushing your teeth."
"PFC signals are more akin to “brushing is good for my hygiene and health”, rather than “move my arm and open my mouth. ” PFC also helps determine if some motor action is appropriate for the specific situation. Think of a behavioral test where you are given two clickers, one to hold in each hand."
"You are told that when the experimenter shows you a green item, you should click with the right button. After repeating this behavior multiple times, you are told to switch – now, when you see a green item, you need to click the left button. In this experiment, PFC is responsible for deciding which motor pattern  is appropriate in response to the stimulus."
"PFC also works to weigh the consequences of motor actions and makes updates about future motor actions in similar or different circumstances. The exact same motor action produces different results depending on the specific situation, and PFC contributes to evaluating and predicting outcomes. The premotor area lies just anterior to the primary motor cortex  ."
"The premotor area helps plan and organize movement and makes decisions about which actions should be used for a situation. The premotor area modulates motor output, and generally activates prior to motor activity. The premotor regions do send some axons directly to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord using the same pathways as the motor cortex ."
"However, the premotor cortex also plays an important role in the planning of movement. Two experimental designs have demonstrated this role. Monkeys were trained on a panel that had one set of lights in a row on top and one set of buttons that could also light up in a row on the bottom."
"The monkeys would watch for a top row light to turn on. This would indicate that within a few seconds, the button directly below would light up. When the button turned on, the monkeys were supposed to push the button."
"Therefore, there were two light triggers in the experiment. The first required no motor movement from the monkey but did give the monkey information about where a motor movement would be needed in the near future. The second required the monkey to move to push the button."
"When brain activity was measured during this study, neurons in the premotor cortex became active when the first light trigger turned on, well before any movement actually took place . In another experiment, people were trained to move their fingers in a specific pattern. Cerebral blood flow was then measured when they repeated the finger pattern and when they only imagined repeating the finger pattern."
"When the movement was only imagined and not actually executed, the premotor regions along with parts of the prefrontal cortex were activated . These studies show that the premotor cortex is active prior to the execution of movement, indicating that it plays an important role in the planning of movement. The posterior parietal, prefrontal, and premotor regions, though, also communicate with a subcortical region called the basal ganglia to fully construct the movement plan."
"The basal ganglia are covered in a future chapter. There is debate about the existence of a special population of cells in the premotor area called mirror neurons. These are cells that are active during a movement, but also when that same movement is observed in another animal or person."
"Proponents argue that these neurons are involved in learning behaviors and for understanding the behaviors of others. Once the plan for movement has been created, the primary motor cortex is responsible for the execution of that action. The primary motor cortex lies just anterior to the primary somatosensory cortex in the precentral gyrus located in the frontal lobe."
"Primary motor cortex  is a major motor control center, required for deliberate, voluntary movements, movements made in response to a “command. ” Furthermore, motor cortex cells influence motor neurons, neurons located in the spinal cord that ultimately communicate with muscles or glands. This connection is so strong that the motor cortex cells are also called upper motor neurons."
"In this terminology, a lower motor neuron is found at the brain stem or spinal cord, and fires whenever the upper motor neuron sends a signal. Like the somatosensory cortex, the motor cortex is organized by a somatotopic map. In the 1930s, neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield conducted several brain operations to treat patients with severe epilepsy."
"However, since the brain has no pain receptors, he was able to remove a portion of the skull under local anesthesia while the patients were awake and responding to his questions. During surgery, the goal was to electrically stimulate portions of the cortex to determine the origin of the seizures, and to ensure that areas critical to speech and hand movement were left untouched so that the patient would not have major impairments following surgery. This is currently done in neuro-oncology to reduce the loss of critical motor function and overall morbidity."
"Penfield progressively moved across different brain areas of M1 while using an electrode to stimulate patches of the cortex. He had two major observations. First, stimulation caused contralateral activity: that is, stimulating the left side of the brain affects the muscle activity of the right side of the body."
"Secondly, by systematically moving across M1, he observed that different populations of neurons are responsible for communicating with specific muscle groups. For instance, dorsal M1 activates hip and trunk muscles, while more lateral M1 activates muscles of the face. Penfield discovered that within the motor cortex, different muscle groups are laid out in a rough topography, meaning that neurons that control the thumb are near other neurons that control the thumb, and near other populations of neurons that control the index finger."
"A graphical representation of this map is called the “motor homunculus,” in which body parts with larger representations in the brain are shown with larger size . Interestingly, the motor cortex does not map onto the body in such an exact way as does the somatosensory system. It is believed that upper motor neurons in the motor cortex control multiple lower motor neurons in the spinal cord that innervate multiple muscles."
"This results in activation of an upper motor neuron causing excitation or inhibition in different neurons at once, indicating that the primary motor cortex is responsible for movements and not simply activation of one muscle. Stimulation of motor neurons in monkeys can lead to complex motions like bringing the hand to the mouth or moving into a defensive position . The motor cortex controls movement by using population coding mechanisms."
"Upper motor neurons are broadly tuned to a certain movement in a certain direction, meaning firing rate is highest when moving in one direction, but firing also occurs when moving in nearby directions. For example, when a monkey is trained to move its hand toward the left, neurons “tuned” toward left movement will be active immediately before and during the movement. Neurons tuned to other directions will also be active but at lower rates ."
This means that the firing rate of one specific neuron does not give enough information to know direction of movement. It is the combined firing rates of an entire population of neurons that indicates direction. There are multiple descending tracts within the spinal cord that send information from the brain to the motor neurons in the ventral horn.
The lateral tracts are responsible for carrying information about voluntary movement of the arms and legs. The ventromedial pathways are responsible for carrying information about posture and balance. The largest of the lateral pathways is the corticospinal tract.
"This pathway sends information directly from the motor and premotor cortices down to the motor neurons in the spinal cord. Cortical axons travel through the brainstem and then cross the midline at the base of the medulla; like the somatosensory system, the right side of the cortex processes information for the left side of the body and vice versa. In the spinal cord, the axons travel through the lateral column and synapse in the ventral horn on motor neurons that typically innervate distal muscles."
The corticobulbar tract is another lateral tract and sends motor information to cranial nerves for motor control of the face. This path travels ipsilateral from the cortex into the brainstem where it branches off at the appropriate cranial nerve level in either the pons or the medulla and then innervates cranial nerve neurons bilaterally. There are four ventromedial pathways that travel in the spinal cord as well.
These tracts begin in the brainstem and descend through the ventromedial columns. They receive input from motor areas of the cortex as well as integrating information from multiple sensory regions. The ventromedial pathways control posture and locomotion.
The vestibulospinal tract is important for head balance as we move. This tract begins in the vestibular nucleus. The vestibular nucleus processes information from the vestibular apparatus .
The axons of the vestibular nucleus project down the cervical spinal cord to control neck and back muscles and guide head movements and also project to the lumbar spinal cord to maintain an upright posture. The tectospinal tract is responsible for moving the head in response to visual stimuli. This tract begins in the superior colliculus .
"The axons of the superior colliculus decussate and project into the cervical regions of the spinal cord to control muscles of the neck, upper trunk, and shoulders. The two reticulospinal tracts play a role in managing anti-gravity reflexes needed for posture and standing. These tracts begin in the reticular formation."
"The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei, meaning groups of neurons that lie below the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia is comprised of the striatum, which consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra The basal ganglia are intimately involved with various aspects of movement, such as voluntary motor activity, habit learning, and the selection of actions. For voluntary motor behavior, the basal ganglia are involved in the initiation or suppression of behavior and can regulate movement through modulating activity in the thalamus and cortex."
"Despite being major structures involved in motor functions, none of the components of the basal ganglia directly send projections down the spinal cord. Rather, they communicate mostly within themselves before signaling through the motor cortex. While the connections between basal ganglia structures have been largely mapped out, the specific functions of each individual structure in isolation is not entirely clear."
"Diseases of the basal ganglia include movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, Huntington’s disease, and Tourette’s, as well as complex psychiatric disorders including addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder . As we discuss the motor circuitry of the basal ganglia, it is important to understand that it is a loop. Activity from the cortex feeds into the basal ganglia, then through the thalamus, and then back to the cortex."
"The function of this loop of structures is to ultimately select and initiate willed movements. The structures of the basal ganglia are briefly defined below. Striatum: The striatum is made up of two components, the caudate nucleus and putamen."
"On a cellular level, the majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic cells. Globus Pallidus: In dissection, the globus pallidus appears as a pale globe. It is subdivided into two components with functionally different connections."
"The globus pallidus internal segment  is located more medially and is movement promoting. On the other hand, the globus pallidus external segment  is located more laterally and is movement inhibiting. The output of the globus pallidus is only via inhibitory projections that are tonically active."
"This means that in the absence of any input, globus pallidus neurons will still inhibit their targets. Subthalamic nucleus: The subthalamic nucleus is an output of the globus pallidus external segment. The output of the subthalamic nucleus are glutamatergic signals into the globus pallidus internal segment."
Substantia Nigra: The substantia nigra is a midbrain structure that appears darker in dissection due to heavy expression of neuromelanin across cells in these areas. It is the largest midbrain structure. The substantia nigra contains several dopamine expressing neurons that project into the striatum.
"Of clinical significance, these neurons experience selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease. The dorsal striatum receives both glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs. The majority of information processed by the basal ganglia enters through the striatum, with projections coming from both cortical and limbic structures such as thalamus and amygdala."
"This input into the striatum is glutamatergic and therefore, excitatory. The striatum also receives dopaminergic projections from another basal ganglia structure, the substantia nigra, a communication route called the nigrostriatal pathway. Dopamine plays an important role in basal ganglia function."
"Parkinson’s disease results when dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra degenerate and no longer send appropriate inputs to the striatum. Dopamine projections can have either excitatory or inhibitory effects in the striatum, depending on the type of metabotropic dopamine receptor the striatal neuron expresses. Dopamine action at a neuron that expresses the D1 receptor is excitatory."
Dopamine action at a neuron that expresses the D2 receptor is inhibitory. The primary output region of the basal ganglia is the internal segment of the globus pallidus . This region sends inhibitory GABAergic projections to nuclei in the thalamus.
"This inhibitory output has a tonic, constant firing rate, which allows the basal ganglia output to both increase and decrease depending on the situation. The thalamus then projects back out to the cerebral cortex, primarily to motor areas. There are multiple connections within the basal ganglia structures as well."
"For motor control, there are two main circuits: the direct pathway and the indirect pathway. These circuits have opposing actions when activated by cortical neurons. The circuits are also modulated by dopamine release by the substantia nigra into the striatum."
"It is believed that the different control mechanisms allow a finely tuned balance between the direct and indirect circuits, which allows for refined control of movement. The direct pathway begins with excitatory input from the cortex to the striatum . The striatum then sends inhibitory projections to the internal segment of the globus pallidus ."
"The GPi then sends inhibitory output to the thalamus. The direct pathway initiates and facilitates voluntary movement. To make a movement, there needs to be activation of the direct pathway."
"When input from either the cortex or substantia nigra increases in intensity, the direct pathway is activated. The neurons in the striatum involved in the direct pathway express the D1 metabotropic dopamine receptor, and the activation of this receptor is excitatory. Therefore, projections from both the cortex and the substantia nigra activate the neurons in the striatum."
"The striatal neurons are inhibitory and release GABA onto the internal segment of the globus pallidus . As described above, the neurons in the GPi are inhibitory, releasing GABA onto the thalamus. Activation of the striatum neurons causes the release of GABA onto neurons in the GPi, inhibiting the GPi neurons."
"Inhibiting the GPi neurons releases their typical inhibition on the thalamus. Inhibition of an inhibitory region is called disinhibition. Therefore, the activation of the direct pathway results in increased output from the thalamus because it is disinhibited."
"Increased thalamic activity leads to increased cortical activity, and increased movement. When at rest , there is not an increase in either glutamatergic or dopaminergic input into the striatum. As a result, there is no change in striatal activity to modulate activity of the GPi."
"The GPi will continue to tonically inhibit the thalamus, keeping cortical activity low and decreasing movement. The indirect pathway is a little more complex. Like the direct pathway, input into the basal ganglia arises from the cortex and substantia nigra, but there are more internal connections within the basal ganglia than what occurs in the direct pathway."
"Inhibitory neurons in the striatum involved in the indirect pathway project to the external segment of the globus pallidus . GABA-ergic neurons in the GPe project to the subthalamic nucleus, which then sends excitatory output to the GPi, which outputs to the thalamus. The indirect pathway is activated by excitatory cortical input, activating the inhibitory striatal neurons."
"This leads to inhibition of the GPe neurons, resulting in disinhibition of the excitatory neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. The excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus to the GPi increases inhibition of the thalamus, leading to decreased thalamic output to the cortex. The indirect pathway can be inhibited by dopamine release from the substantia nigra."
"The neurons in the striatum involved in the indirect pathway express the D2 metabotropic dopamine receptor. The activation of this receptor is inhibitory. If the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine projections from the substantia nigra, the inhibitory striatal neurons are inhibited."
"This leads to disinhibiton of the GPe neurons, resulting in inhibition of the excitatory neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. This decreased excitatory output to the GPi decreases inhibition of the thalamus, leading to increased thalamic output to the cortex. To put it all together, there is input to the striatum from two different locations: cortex  and substantia nigra ."
Cortical activation of the direct pathway leads to increased thalamic output. Cortical activation of the indirect pathway leads to decreased thalamic output. Substantia nigra activation  of the direct pathway leads to increased thalamic output.
"Substantia nigra inhibition  of the indirect pathway leads to increased thalamic output. It is the combination of these pathways that allows for precise control of motor movement, balancing the excitatory direct pathway with the inhibitory indirect pathway. There are multiple circuits that pass through the basal ganglia:  The motor circuit, which plays a role in voluntary movement."
"The oculomotor circuit, which plays a role in eye movement. The associative circuit, which plays a role in executive functions like behavioral inhibition  planning and problem solving, and mediating socially appropriate behaviors. The limbic or emotional circuit, which plays a role in the processing of emotion and reward."
"Although the circuits each use different circuits within the basal ganglia, the general loop is the same: cortical input to the striatum leads to internal processing within the basal ganglia structures. Basal ganglia output projects from the pallidum to the thalamus, which then projects back to the cortex. It is important to recognize that the basal ganglia plays an important role in a number of functions."
"For example, medications that are used to treat Parkinson’s can sometimes lead to the presentation of impulse control disorders, a result of dopaminergic changes in the limbic loop through the basal ganglia. Neurodegenerative diseases cause neurons to lose either their function or structure over time, potentially leading to cell death in either the central or peripheral nervous system. These diseases can be devastating because there are no known ways to reverse the neurodegeneration."
"There are multiple diseases that are classified as neurodegenerative diseases and affect millions of people worldwide. We will focus on the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases: The motor disease Parkinson’s disease that affects the basal ganglia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that causes bradykinesia , akinesia , a resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and changes to posture and locomotion."
"Although most symptoms are motor, there are mild cognitive and psychiatric changes, such as apathy, anhedonia, mood disturbances, or depression. Advanced age is the primary risk factor, as an estimated 2% of people over the age of 60 develop Parkinson’s disease. It is also shows a sex difference with men being diagnosed more than women."
"Other environmental factors contribute to risk, such as repeated traumatic brain injury  or occupational exposure to heavy metals, insecticides, or other neurotoxins. A small percentage of cases are early onset , and have a strong genetic component. The disease causes significant decreases in life expectancy and quality of life."
"A loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra  contributes to basal ganglia circuitry disruption in Parkinson’s disease. This loss of substantia nigra cells can be visualized postmortem without the use of histology due to the natural black pigmentation of the substantia nigra cells. When the substantia nigra cells die, they are no longer able to release dopamine at the striatum appropriately."
"When less dopamine is released into the striatum, the two populations of striatal neurons are affected differently dependent on the type of dopamine receptor that they express. Recall the basal ganglia circuitry from the previous chapter. Within the direct pathway, striatal cells  express excitatory D1 receptors that project  directly to the globus pallidus internal segment."
"In the direct pathway, typically, dopamine binds to D1 receptors on striatal neurons, increasing caudate activity. These striatal neurons release GABA onto the globus pallidus internal segment  neurons, causing the GPi neurons to be less active. When the Gpi neurons are less active, they release less GABA onto the thalamic neurons, increasing thalamic neuron activity and the excitatory projections to the motor cortex, thus increasing movement."
"In Parkinson’s disease, there is decreased release of dopamine onto the striatal caudate neurons that express D1 receptors, making them less active. Now that the striatal neurons are not as active, they release less GABA onto GPi neurons, disinhibiting them. The GPi is now more active, releasing more GABA onto thalamic neurons."
"In response, the thalamic neurons are less active and send less excitatory messages to the cortex, thus causing a decrease in movement overall. In the indirect pathway, dopamine typically binds to inhibitory D2 receptors on striatal  neurons, inhibiting striatal neuron activity. These striatal neurons then release less GABA onto the globus pallidus external segment neurons , causing the GPe neurons to be more active."
"When the GPe neurons are more active, they release more GABA onto the subthalamic nucleus neurons, decreasing subthalamic neuron activity and the excitatory projections to the GPi. Decreasing activation of the GPi causes the GPi to release less GABA onto the thalamus, which then causes more activation of the motor cortex,  thus increasing movement. In Parkinson’s disease, there is decreased release of dopamine onto the striatal neurons that express D2 receptors, making them more active."
"Now that the striatal neurons are more active, they release more GABA onto GPe neurons. This inhibits the GPe neurons, causing them to release less GABA onto subthalamic nucleus neurons, disinhibiting the subthalamic nucleus. Increasing the excitatory inputs from the subthalamic nucleus onto the GPi will cause the GPi to release more GABA onto the thalamus."
"In response, the thalamic neurons are less active and send less excitatory messages to the cortex, thus causing a decrease in movement overall. Parkinson’s disease is considered idiopathic because there is not a single known cause. Unfortunately, there are not measurable biomarkers  to diagnose Parkinson’s disease."
"Rather, diagnosis of individuals is typically done by a neurologist and a detailed exam. This can be further confirmed by giving medications that are used to treat Parkinson’s disease and determining if symptoms decrease. A diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is confirmed post-mortem through:  The loss of dopaminergic substantia nigra cells."
Presence of Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are intracellular alpha-nuclein protein aggregates that are believed to potentially displace healthy neurons and lead to the neurodegeneration observed in the disease. Dopamine cannot be administered as a treatment to those with Parkinson’s disease to replace the loss of dopamine from the substantia nigra due to the inability of dopamine to cross the blood-brain-barrier.
"Instead, the major drug treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease has been administration of the drug levodopa . L-DOPA is an intermediate in the synthesis of dopamine. Typically, it is converted into dopamine through the activity of DOPA decarboxylase."
"It is typically co-administered with other drugs to help prolong its effects. Unfortunately, there are many side effects of L-DOPA including nausea, joint stiffness, dyskinesias , and psychosis. In a medical intervention called deep brain stimulation , a surgeon implants permanently indwelling electrodes directly into brain tissue."
"These electrodes are controlled by an external battery pack that delivers preprogrammed stimulation protocols. DBS in the STN is used to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. As we age, the human brain is subject to degradation over our lifetime."
This normal aging results in moderate cell loss and a gradual loss of myelination and synapses. These structural changes result in normal age-related functional losses . Alzheimer’s disease was first described In 1907 by Dr.
"Alois Alzheimer. He had described one of his patients, a 50-year old woman named Auguste Deter, whose symptoms included profound cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and delusions. After Deter’s death, post-mortem analysis of her brain revealed anomalies: degenerating neurons that contained atypical tangles and deposits scattered between cells."
"Alzheimer’s disease  is not a natural result of the aging process, but there is an increased risk of AD as we age. It is an irreversible, slowly progressing neurodegenerative condition that leads to deficits in thinking, behavior, and memory loss. AD is a devastating disease that accounts for 60-80% of all cases of dementia and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States."
"As for prevalence, approximately 10% of people older than 65 and nearly a third older of people older than 85 has AD. Specifically, declarative memory is the first form of memory loss observed in AD patients. As the disease progresses, procedural memory loss becomes more apparent."
"In addition to memory loss, AD symptoms include problems with language, disorientation, mood swings, loss of motivation, lack of self care, behavioral problems, loss of bodily functions, and dementia. AD is divided into two categories, familial and sporadic. Familial AD is diagnosed when a person is in their 50s or 60s, and is strongly influenced by genetic risk factors."
"This form of AD only makes up about 10% of cases. Sporadic AD is by far more common than familial AD, and is believed to be caused by a combination of old age and environmental factors in addition to genetic risk factors. Several genetic risk factors are linked to AD risk."
"Apolipoprotein epsilon4  is the greatest genetic risk factor identified, where individuals who are homozygous for the e4 polymorphism have a 12-times higher risk of developing AD than people with the more common e3 variant. Additionally, mutations in genes like amyloid-precursor protein , presenilin-1  presenilin-2 , and triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2  are all associated with higher risk of developing AD. In AD, brain atrophy is observed across the brain, especially in later progression of the disease, however two structures that see the most atrophy are the hippocampus and cortex."
"One of the main structures affected in Alzheimer’s disease is the hippocampus, which is located curled up inside the temporal lobes. The hippocampus is a critical structure in learning and memory, especially in spatial memory and in consolidation of short-term memory into long-term memory. The prefrontal cortex is also heavily affected in AD."
"The prefrontal cortex is the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe and functions in intellect, cognition, recall, problem solving, planning, and personality. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the extracellular accumulation of amyloidbeta plaques  that build up in the space between neurons and intracellular hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tau tangles . The amyloid cascade hypothesis, originally proposed in 1992, has become the leading theory in the field describing how AD develops."
"The hypothesis suggests that the main driving factor of AD is the deposition of Aβ in the brain, and this in turn leads to neurodegeneration via cell death, abnormal protein buildup, and neuroinflammation. Aβ is produced from the cleavage of amyloid-precursor protein , an integral membrane protein normally expressed by neurons that typically functions as a cell surface receptor and is important in neuronal adhesion, neurite growth, and axogenesis. In AD, the extracellular soluble portion of APP is cleaved by the enzyme beta-secretase and then the enzyme gamma secretase cleaves the APP anchor, leaving Aβ protein that is no longer held within the membrane."
"Aβ is likely to clump together in unpredictable ways within the extracellular space, leading to the formation of Aβ plaques . These plaques can cause neuronal death and lead to the cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. Two major genetic risk factors for AD, presenilin 1 and 2, are mutations of the gamma secretase that leads to increased APP cleavage."
Therapies are being developed to target and control the Aβ protein to mitigate AD symptoms. Recently an antibody-based drug has been approved by the FDA. This groundbreaking drug is unique from those traditionally prescribed because it directly targets Aβ.
"However, the amyloid-cascade hypothesis does not tell the whole story. For one, there are patients who carry a heavy Aβ load but present no clinical symptoms of AD. More so, in mouse models with APP mutations, they develop significant Aβ plaques, but have no accumulation of tau  and no significant neurodegeneration."
"Additionally, there have been several drugs targeting Aβ that have failed in human trials. While these amyloid plaques seem to be the primary driving factor of AD, hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles  are also potential culprits in disease progression. NFTs are an intracellular pathological marker of AD and correlate strongly with cognitive deficits in AD."
"Tau protein is the major microtubule-associate protein  of mature neurons and helps to function to maintain cellular morphology. Excess phosphorylation of this protein causes tau to accumulate inside the cell, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. The presence of Aβ increases the levels of the tau, and vice versa, adding to the complexity and difficulty of treating AD."
"Tau pathology is also observed in other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobe dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Although most discussion of AD revolves around plaques and tangles, it is well known that a cacophony of pathological markers are also seen in AD, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, heavy metal dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, and many more. An early hypothesis proposed to explain the neuronal loss and memory deficits observed in AD is centered around changes in the signaling of acetylcholine."
"Early post-mortem analyses discovered that people with AD have profound atrophy of the basal forebrain, an area which contains a large density of cholinergic neurons. Further, patients with Alzheimer’s disease also show decreased levels of choline acetyltransferase, reduced choline uptake in cells, and reduced release of acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis suggests that it is this loss of cholinergic neurons and the loss of acetylcholine signaling that is the main pathological driver of AD."
"The theory is supported by the idea that acetylcholine plays an important role in learning and memory. To this day, only post-mortem analysis can conclusively diagnose someone with AD. As expected, this raises many issues in terms of treating these patients."
"Currently, physicians diagnose a patient with AD based on the symptoms they presented with. However, new techniques to make more accurate diagnoses are emerging, including identifying the presence of biomarkers from blood samples, certain functional characteristics as observed in PET or fMRI imaging, and possibly even through eye exams. Mild cognitive disorder/impairment represents a modest level of cognitive decline that interferes with the ability to complete everyday activities."
"Whereas major cognitive disorder/impairment is considered a major impairment and includes different dementias and Alzheimer’s disease. Most of the FDA approved drugs for AD are acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors, drugs that act to increase levels of acetylcholine. The other approved FDA drug is an NMDA receptor antagonist."
"This drug is prescribed because it is hypothesized that AD may involve glutamate excitotoxicity, where excess binding of glutamate can increase intracellular  Ca2+ levels leading to Ca2+ poisoning and neuron death. Unfortunately, these compounds show only short-term benefits for cognitive function, and these therapeutic effects subside over time. The different drugs are prescribed during different stages of AD, have modest effects and have unwanted side effects."
"Motivated behaviors are voluntary behaviors that individuals find rewarding or pleasurable. Motivation varies in intensity which will correlate to the probability of performing the associated behavior. Certain behaviors or stimuli, like food or sex, are naturally rewarding because they are necessary for the survival of a species; they are adaptive, and the nervous system has evolved to make these behaviors pleasurable."
Rewarding stimuli increases brain activation in brain regions that comprise the reward circuit. Homeostasis is maintenance of the body’s internal environment within a physiological range. The hypothalamus is important in regulating many homeostatic processes by responding to sensory input when a deviation from homeostatic set point is detected.
"The hypothalamus is located ventrally on the brain and surrounds the third ventricle. Sensory neurons within the hypothalamus measure changes in parameters that need to be regulated within the body, such as temperature, water balance, and feeding. When that parameter is sensed to be outside the normal physiological range, these hypothalamic neurons will initiate a three component process that will act to bring that parameter back within range : humoral response, visceromotor response, and somatic motor response."
"In the humoral response, neurosecretory cells within the hypothalamus regulate release of pituitary hormones into circulation. The word ‘humoral’ comes from the word ‘humor’ which is an older word that refers to different fluids within the body. In the case of the humoral response, the bodily fluid is in reference to the blood where the hormones are being released."
"The hypothalamus contains two types of neurons that secrete hormones into the pituitary: parvocellular neurosecretory cells and magnocellular neurosecretory cells. Magnocellular neurosecretory cells, the larger type of neurosecretory cell compared to parvocellular neurons, send axons from the hypothalamus down to the pituitary stalk where they terminate on capillaries of the general circulation located within the posterior pituitary. Therefore, the hormones that are released by the posterior pituitary gland are actually made within the hypothalamus."
"For this reason, the posterior pituitary is considered neural tissue, rather than endocrine tissue. The magnocellular neurons synthesize and release oxytocin and vasopressin, two neuropeptides, into the blood. Oxytocin, often referred to as the love hormone, promotes social bonding."
"It is released during reproduction and also causes uterine contractions during labor and the milk letdown reflex after birth. Vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone, plays a role in regulating salt concentration in the blood by acting on the kidneys to promote water retention and decrease urine production. Vasopressin has also been shown to be involved in bonding, parenting, territoriality, and mate guarding in some animals."
Parvocellular cells are smaller than the magnocellular neurons . These neurons release hypophysiotropic hormones into a specialized capillary system that lies between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland called the hypophyseal portal circulation. The hypophysiotropic hormones cause anterior pituitary cells to make and release their own hormones.
"The anterior pituitary gland is therefore endocrine tissue because the cells make their own hormones. There are multiple hormones that are made and released by the anterior pituitary gland. They act on multiple target tissues throughout the body, including the gonads, thyroid glands, adrenal glands, and mammary glands."
"The visceromotor response involves hypothalamic neurons that adjust sympathetic and parasympathetic activity to regulate internal organs. The somatic motor response involves hypothalamic neurons that trigger an appropriate behavioral response. Using a drop in temperature as an example, the humoral response will cause the release of hormones into circulation that will allow you to metabolize energy in a different way that will allow for more generation of heat."
"The visceromotor response would increase sympathetic nervous system activity to ensure that internal organs stay warm. Lastly, the somatic motor response would cause a behavioral change that would result in getting warmer . We obtain energy from our diet and consumption of glucose, which serves as our energy source within the body."
"The body depends on access to glucose for normal function and survival. To ensure access to glucose when needed, our body stores glucose within the body in fat stores. We are motivated to eat and maintain these body fat stores."
"Body fat stores are regulated after we eat a meal. When we consume more glucose than we can use, the excess glucose is stored within the body as fat stores. Over time, this repeated pattern leads to increased adiposity and can lead to obesity."
"If energy demands exceed the consumption of glucose, then glucose must be broken down from fat stores and fat is lost. Over time, this leads to decreased adiposity and starvation. The body tries to defend fat stores and body weight around a particular set point."
"When rodents have restricted access to calories they experience a decrease in body weight, however when food is freely available again, they gain weight back to their weight prior to calorie restriction. Conversely, animals that are force fed to consume more calories than normal will gain weight, but will lose that gained weight when they are free to regulate their own feeding. To maintain a balance of fat stores and expended energy, we regulate our feeding behavior."
There are both short-term and long-term mechanisms that contribute to feeding regulation and maintenance of fat stores. The level of fat within the body must somehow be communicated to the brain in a way that ultimately controls feeding behavior. The discovery of genetically obese mice by Dr.
Douglas Coleman and colleagues helped determine the source of this signal. The DNA of the genetically obese mice found that these animals were missing both copies of the ob gene. These mice are referred to as ob / ob mice.
"It was theorized that the ob gene must produce a hormone that typically signals that fat reserves are sufficient. Without this gene, and thus without this hormone, the obese mice were not receiving the appropriate signal to stop eating, causing them to over eat and increase fat stores. It was determined that the ob gene codes for the hormone leptin, which is secreted by fat cells."
"The ob mice had sufficient levels of fat, but did not have the hormone leptin released by the fat cells that would typically decrease feeding behavior. In fact, when ob mice are treated with leptin, they no longer over eat and restore a normal body weight. More leptin is secreted when fat levels are high."
"Leptin acts to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure, which will ultimately decrease levels of fat, and maintain normal fat stores levels in the body. Though it may seem that leptin administration would be an effective treatment for obesity, leptin treatment is only effective for individuals with an identified leptin deficiency. Those without a leptin deficiency have increased levels of leptin due to increased fat stores, but ultimately have neurons with decreased sensitivity to leptin levels."
"Two areas of the hypothalamus have been historically described with regard to their role in feeding behavior through lesion studies. If the lateral hypothalamus is bilaterally lesioned, it results in lateral hypothalamic syndrome and anorexia, whereas bilateral lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus results in ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome and overeating/obesity. Though it follows that the lateral hypothalamus causes feeding behavior to increase and the ventromedial hypothalamus causes feeding behavior to decrease, leptin signaling within these structures underlies these behavioral changes."
"The neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus have receptors that detect levels of circulating leptin. The arcuate nucleus neurons produce peptide neurotransmitters called αMSH  and CART . Note, that the names of peptides are typically derived from the first identified function of the peptide, but that additional functions are later discovered, which can lead to the names of the peptides being somewhat confusing."
"Changes in leptin levels will lead to the humoral, visceromotor, and somatic motor hypothalamic responses. When fat levels are increased, leptin levels are also increased. In the humoral hypothalamic response, leptin binds to neurons in the arcuate nucleus."
"This population of arcuate neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus  and release αMSH and CART onto the PVN neurons. In response to the binding of αMSH and CART, the PVN neurons cause the release of the hypophysiotropic hormones. The anterior pituitary gland will then release thyroid stimulating hormone  and adrenocorticotropic hormone , which will both act to raise the metabolic rate within the body."
"When leptin levels are high, leptin will also bind to a separate population of arcuate neurons that project to the brainstem and control the hypothalamic visceromotor response. These arcuate neurons release αMSH and CART onto brainstem neurons that will act to increase sympathetic nervous system activity, raising the metabolic rate and increasing body temperature. Lastly, when leptin levels are high, leptin binds to a third population of arcuate neurons that project to the lateral hypothalamus and control the hypothalamic somatic motor response."
"These arcuate neurons release αMSH and CART onto lateral hypothalamus neurons. αMSH and CART inhibit the lateral hypothalamus, inhibiting feeding behavior. Overall, the increase in metabolic rate, increase in body temperature, and decreased feeding will all ultimately lead to a decrease in body fat and thus a decrease in leptin levels, bringing fat and leptin levels back within the physiological setpoint range."
"αMSH, CART, and Leptin are all examples of anorexigenic, or satiety, signals. Collectively, anorexigenic signals decrease feeding behavior and decrease body weight in response to increased adiposity. When fat levels are decreased, leptin levels are also decreased."
"When leptin levels drop, an entirely different set of neurons within the arcuate nucleus are activated that release the neuropeptides neuropeptide Y  and agouti-related peptide . In the humoral hypothalamic response, the drop in leptin activates neurons in the arcuate nucleus. This population of arcuate neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus  and release NPY and AgRP onto the PVN neurons."
"These neuropeptides inhibit the PVN, thereby inhibiting release of the hypophysiotropic hormones, and ultimately inhibiting release of TSH and ACTH. As a result, metabolic activity in the body is decreased. When leptin levels are low, arcuate neurons are activated that project to the brainstem and control the hypothalamic visceromotor response."
"These arcuate neurons release NPY and AgRP onto brainstem neurons that will act to increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, decreasing the metabolic rate and decreasing body temperature. Lastly, when leptin levels are low, the drop in leptin activates a population of arcuate neurons that project to the lateral hypothalamus and control the hypothalamic somatic motor response. These arcuate neurons release NPY and AgRP onto lateral hypothalamus neurons."
"NPY and AgRP stimulate the lateral hypothalamus, stimulating feeding behavior. Overall, the decrease in metabolic rate, decrease in body temperature, and increased feeding brought about by the three hypothalamic responses will all ultimately lead to an increase in body fat and thus an increase in leptin levels, bringing fat and leptin levels back within the physiological setpoint range. NPY and AgRP are examples of orexigenic signals."
"Orexigenic signals increase feeding behavior and increase body weight in response to changes in adiposity. AgRP and αMSH are considered antagonistic neurotransmitters because they both bind to the MC4 receptor on hypothalamic neurons, but exert opposite effects on feeding behavior. Having a sense of reward is a valuable adaptive trait."
"Consider two similar organisms living in the distant geologic past, both involved in Darwin’s struggle to pass their genetic material to the following generation. One of these creatures gets an internal rewarding sensation whenever it drinks water while thirsty, eats high-caloric-content food, or successfully reproduces. As can be expected, this organism is highly motivated to seek out those rewarding stimuli in the world."
"It is are more likely to crave sugary foods to maximize daily caloric intake necessary for activity and growth. The other creature does not experience pleasure from its actions, resulting in little motivation to seek out calories or to reproduce, for example. It stands to reason that the first of these two creatures has an evolutionary advantage to survive."
"As can be expected, the regions of the brain that are concerned with reward are highly conserved through evolution. For us humans, our reward signaling neural circuitry starts with the ventral tegmental area . Located in the midbrain, the VTA contains neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine ."
"This population of DA cells is similar to the cells in the substantia nigra, the midbrain neurons that are lost in Parkinson’s disease. There are two primary pathways from the VTA that are important for reward. The mesolimbic pathway consists of dopamine-producing neurons that release dopamine onto the cells in the nucleus accumbens ."
"This seems to be the major pathway by which reward is mediated by the brain. Using microdialysis, it is possible to measure the dopamine concentration in the NAc during performance of some behavioral tasks. In studies with rats, engaging in rewarding activities such as eating or sex results in increased release of dopamine in the NAc."
"Similarly we see that release of dopamine into the human NAc is enhanced when we engage in activities we enjoy: binge eating sugary stuff, having sex, even playing video games. Notably, many drugs of abuse such as cocaine or amphetamine can induce a similar overflow of dopamine release when an animal is exposed to the drug. The second area that receives VTA innervation is the prefrontal cortex , and this projection is called the mesocortical pathway."
"We think of the PFC as being involved in the conscious, decision making and inhibition of action. One of the earliest experiments demonstrating functional evidence of a “reward circuit” was conducted at McGill University in the early 1950’s. Drs."
"James Olds and Peter Milner carried out surgery on anesthetized rats to implant metal electrodes into different areas of the brain. After recovery, the rats were placed into an operant conditioning chamber, also called a Skinner box. These special cages are equipped with a device which the subject can physically manipulate."
"For example, the cage may have a lever which the animal can push, or a hole into which they can poke their nose. In the case of Olds and Milner’s experiments, a lever press led to activation of the implanted electrodes, resulting in neuronal activation. They had found that when the electrode was implanted into brain areas such as the corpus callosum or the hippocampus, the rats did not spend significant time pressing on the lever."
"However, the rats which had the electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle that is located in the VTA to NAc pathway, responded frequently on the lever. One such rat pressed the lever almost 2000 times in less than an hour, averaging nearly one response every two seconds! Electrical activation of reward centers is so desirable, rats will choose electrical stimulation over food even to the point of starvation. This experimental paradigm is also called intracranial-self stimulation ."
"Treatment with drugs that block the receptors for dopamine reduce the self-stimulating behavior, indicating that dopamine is the critical neurotransmitter involved in making the stimulation of these brain regions rewarding. And while the original studies were conducted on rats, clinicians soon after tested their model in humans, with similar indwelling electrodes in different brain regions. Unsurprisingly, humans also have areas of the brain that are responsible for encoding reward, and when given the chance to electrically activate those areas, they do so extensively."
"When the experimenters brought in a tray of delicious food to the test chamber, the hungry patients—who hadn’t eaten for upwards of seven hours—simply looked at the meal, but couldn’t pull themselves away from the stimulation button long enough to eat. Artificial stimulation of these reward centers of the brain was more valuable to the patients than nutrition. However, continued research suggests the connection between dopamine release and reward may not be as simple as the self-stimulation studies imply."
"It appears that it is not the reward itself that increases dopamine, but the predicted expectation of the reward . Dopamine signaling increases during anticipation of a predicted reward. If the level of reward is more than predicted, reward learning occurs, and dopamine signaling and motivation to repeat that behavior increases."
"If the level of reward is less than predicted, then dopamine signaling decreases as does motivation to repeat the behavior. Natural rewards that increase survival and fitness of a species activate the reward circuit. These behaviors and stimuli include certain food , social bonding, parental bonding, and sex."
"Most drugs of abuse also activate the reward circuit and dopamine signaling, which plays a critical role in the formation of addiction. For example, cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake into presynaptic VTA terminals; heroin and nicotine increase dopamine release from the VTA. These alterations increase dopamine effect on neurons in the nucleus accumbens."
"Here we will examine an additional rewarding behavior. Rodents, such as rats, are used as a model for studying sexual behavior and reward. When in the presence of a sexually receptive female rat, a male rat will engage in male sexual behavior, called mounting behavior."
Mounting behavior is controlled by the medial preoptic area  of the hypothalamus in males. Female rats display their own sexual behavior called lordosis. Lordosis behavior is displayed as an arched-back posture that is controlled by the ventromedial hypothalamus .
"Female rats also have the ability to pace their sexual interactions by controlling the timing of the sexual interaction. The female rat will run around the cage and choose when they will stop and allow the male to engage in mounting behavior. Steroid hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone regulate activity of the mPOA and VMH."
"When considering sexual behavior as a model for motivated behaviors, it is important that we understand why an animal engages in sexual behavior. A modified operant chamber was constructed by Everitt and colleagues  that helped to answer this question. A male rat was trained to press a lever within the chamber that when pressed would open a door and allow for access to a sexually-receptive female rat, with whom the male could engage in a sexual bout."
"Males easily learned this paradigm and consistently pressed the lever to gain access to the female . When the mPOA was lesioned in the male rats and they were tested in this same operant chamber, the male rats still pressed the lever to gain access to the female rat, even though they no longer had the ability to perform sexual mounting behavior. However, when the nucleus accumbens was lesioned and the mPOA remained intact, the male rats no longer pressed the lever."
"They had lost the motivation associated with the prospect of sexual experience, thus demonstrating that the nucleus accumbens, and the reward pathway drive the motivation for sexual behavior in rodents, not the brain structure that controls sexual behavior. It follows that in female rats, the motivation to engage in sexual behavior is dependent on activity of the nucleus accumbens, and not on activity within the VMH. Measuring extracellular dopamine concentrations outside the nucleus accumbens through microdialysis techniques has demonstrated that extracellular dopamine increases during many different behaviors considered to be rewarding, including male and female sexual behavior."
"Conditioned place preference  is a behavioral test that can be used as way of measuring the reward associated with different stimuli. CPP is commonly used as a way to measure reward associated with different drugs of abuse, but the paradigm can also be used to measure the rewarding aspects of natural rewards, such as sexual behavior. In a CPP paradigm, a CPP appartus is used that typically has two distinct testing chambers that have different colors or patterns on the walls, and different tactile surfaces on the floor of the chamber."
"Additionally, there is a neutral compartment between the two testing chambers. As an example, one testing chamber might have white walls and hard bedding on the floor, whereas the other testing chamber has gray walls and soft bedding. An experimental male animal can be placed in the neutral central compartment and then given 10 minutes to explore the entirety of the apparatus."
"The amount of time that the animal spends in each chamber is recorded as a pre-test measurement. Next, the chambers are sectioned off from each other and the experimental male animal is placed with a sexually-receptive female animal in the gray chamber with soft bedding. The experimental male then has a 10-minute sexual experience within the gray chamber."
"After the sexual experience, they are also placed alone in the white chamber with hard bedding. This is repeated for several weeks, such that the animals learn to associate sexual experience with the gray chamber environment and learn to associate nothing with the white chamber environment. Lastly, the experimental animal is placed alone in the central neutral compartment and again permitted to access the entire apparatus."
"The amount of time spent in each of the chambers is recorded as a post-test measurement. By comparing the time spending in the conditioning chamber during the pre-test to the time spent in the conditioning chamber during the post-test, it can be determined if the animal spends significantly more time in the chamber that was paired with the sexual experience. Researchers interpret a significantly increased time spent in the conditioning compartment as a measurement of the reward that the animal feels being in that environment."
"If no significant difference is observed between the pre-test and post-test times in the conditioning compartment, then the testing substance or behavior is not considered to be rewarding to the animal. Using this paradigm, administration of a dopamine antagonist to animals prior to the conditioning sessions prevents the formation of a conditioned place preference, indicating that dopamine within the reward pathway underlies the reward associated with sexual behavior. In the United States, more than 59 million people aged 12 and over have used illegal drugs or misused prescription drugs within the last year."
"Use of some of these drugs carry significant health risks, and their use has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, making drug use one of the highest preventable causes of mortality. For some people, drug use turns into a substance use disorder, or addiction. Importantly, many more individuals misuse drugs than are drug-dependent."
"Substance use disorder, typically referred to as addiction has many different facets. The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines drug addiction as “a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological , psychological, social and spiritual manifestations."
"This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors. ” One of the major challenges with understanding substance use disorder and other brain disorders is related to the difficulty of making an accurate diagnosis as almost everything in biology exists on a spectrum. To help establish a diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association  has put together a series of criteria for psychiatrists to diagnose these complex conditions."
"The guidelines are compiled in a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. They are currently on the fifth revision of the text, referred to as the DSM-5. It’s an imperfect set of criteria, but it is a start towards understanding these remarkably complicated conditions."
"According to DSM-5, a substance use disorder may be an appropriate diagnosis when at least two of the following characteristics occur within a 12-month period of time and cause significant impairment or distress:  The quantity of the substance used or the amount of time spent using is often greater than intended; Efforts to control use of the substance are unsuccessful due to a persistent desire for the substance; Considerable time is spent using the substance, recovering from its effects, or attempting to obtain the substance; A strong desire, craving, or urge to use the substance is present; Substance use interferes with major role obligations at work, school, or home; Use of the substance continues despite harmful social or interpersonal effects caused or made worse by substance use; Participation in social, work, or leisure activities is avoided or reduced due to substance use; Substance use occurs in situations where substance use may be physically hazardous; Continued substance use occurs even when the substance is causing physical or psychological problems or making these problems worse; Tolerance for the substance develops, including a need for increasing quantities of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effects or a noticeable decrease in effects when using the same amount of the substance; After heavy or sustained use of a substance, reduction in or abstinence from the substance results in withdrawal symptoms or precipitates resumption of use of the substance or similar substances to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Substance use disorder is prevalent worldwide. On top of the direct health risks associated with compulsive drug use, drug addiction has a tremendous financial burden: Alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs cost the US more than $740 billion dollars in lost productivity, health care costs, and legal related fees and fines."
"In the early 1900s, US laws regulating the manufacturing, distribution, possession, and use of drugs were complicated. Certain substances were banned, but regulation of the substances was left largely to individual states. It wasn’t until 1970 when a nationwide proposed regulatory measure would combine all of the current federal mandates regarding misused drugs into a single bill, and Richard Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act  into law."
"Under the terms of the CSA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Food and Drug Administration would be responsible for developing regulations about a wide variety of chemical substances. For each drug, they would be tasked with evaluating the health-related properties of the drug and its impact on health, including toxicity, harm, and addiction potential. Despite a dramatic increase in the cost of drug enforcement that followed the signing of the Controlled Substances Act, the rate of drug addiction in the United States has remained unchanged."
"Drugs are defined as chemical substances that come from outside the body; drugs are exogenous substances that can influence a person’s physical or mental state. Keeping in mind the impact on health and addiction potential, drugs are classified into one of five categories, rated Schedule I through Schedule V. Drugs put into Schedule I are substances that were perceived to have the highest addiction potential, most severe health risks, and no medical applications."
"On the other end of the spectrum are Schedule V substances, drugs with low addiction potential, few health risks, and legitimate uses within the clinical setting. Substances classified under Schedule I include heroin, for example, while a Schedule V substance might be an antiepileptic drug like Lyrica. Today, the list of controlled substances contains more than 400 chemicals."
"Interesting, neither tobacco or alcohol is regulated under the terms of the Controlled Substances Act, despite these drugs being among the most misused in the US with tremendous health risks, high addiction potential, and little medical application. There are probably thousands and thousands of psychoactive substances, chemicals that can act on the nervous system which can induce a change in behavior or mind state. Some major abused drugs are described below."
"According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, alcohol is the most widely used substance among these drugs, with more than 85% of adults reporting having used alcohol at some point in their lives. Chemically speaking, many substances are classified as “alcohols”, but the most common misused is ethyl alcohol or ethanol. Ethanol is an easily-obtained substance with a highly intoxicating effect."
"The overwhelming majority of ethanol use is recreational. The World Health Organization reports that alcohol use is the leading risk factor for premature death among males aged 15-59 globally, making it one of the overall top causes of preventable death. Acute exposure to ethanol has effects that differ depending on dosage."
"At low concentrations, ethanol can induce an elevation in mood, decreased anxiety, increased risk taking, slowing of reflexes, and impaired judgment. At high concentrations, ethanol can cause memory deficits, loss of consciousness, analgesia and areflexia, and possible death through respiratory depression. Chronic exposure to low levels of alcohol has some pro-health benefits such as decreased risk of death by cardiovascular events, but in general, these benefits are outweighed by negative health outcomes."
"Nicotine is the main psychoactive ingredient of tobacco products. Nicotine is an alkaloid compound that is synthesized in nature by a variety of plants, with the tobacco plant having the highest nicotine content. Other plants of the Solanaceae family , such as eggplants and tomatoes, also contains nicotine, as it was probably an anti-herbivory evolutionary adaptation."
"The most common routes of administration for nicotine include inhalation , transbuccal , or transdermal . Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, often rated as addictive as cocaine or heroin. It is currently the leading cause of preventable death in the US, causing nearly one out of every five deaths."
"When a person smokes a cigarette, they experience a rapid rush or a high within tens of seconds. Chronic smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung, throat, and mouth cancers, coronary heart disease, or stroke. Cigarette smoking over the past several decades has seen a sharp decline, in part due to the success of anti-smoking campaigns in changing public opinion toward smoking, and government-led changes in legislation resulting in stricter marketing laws, especially in regards to targeted advertising aimed at youth."
"In the mid 1970’s, almost 30% of 12th graders reported smoking cigarettes daily, and that number has decreased to only 4% in 2018. On the other hand, the rising popularity of vape among teenagers has encouraged nicotine consumption through an alternate route of administration: Teen e-cigarette users are more than 3 times more likely to start smoking cigarettes compared to non e-cigarette users. Cannabis is a drug that is derived from the flowering buds or other parts of the Cannabis sativa plant."
"The most common route of administration is inhalation, or smoking. As cannabis becomes decriminalized or outright legalized across the US, oral preparations are becoming more commonplace. The effects of cannabis are often felt within minutes, and can include a sense of euphoria, relaxation, distortion in the sense of perception, and potentially a lightness  or a heaviness of body ."
"Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug federally, but as of 2022, 23 states/territories have legalized recreational use of cannabis, and only 12 states do not permit cannabis for medicinal use. The stigma surrounding the “evils” of cannabis use are largely a remnant of a morality propaganda campaign driven by the publishing of such “educational” films as Reefer Madness in 1936. Much of our current medical understanding of cannabis is that it is far less harmful than once believed, although it does have a negative impact on the developing brain, as significant adolescent exposure to cannabis increases the likelihood of developing psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia later in life."
"Opioids are a class of drugs, either natural or synthetic, that can bind to and activate the body’s endogenous complement of opioid receptors. The most well known natural opioid is opium, but the other popular drugs of this class include the street drug heroin or the medicinal substances morphine or fentanyl. Derived from the poppy plant, evidence of human use of opioids for both medical and recreational use dates back more than 5000 years to ancient Sumer."
"The body naturally produces opioid substances, endorphin being the most well known. Activation of opioid receptors, either by endogenously produced opioids or exogenous opioids, induce a potent analgesia, dampening the sensation of pain. Opioid drugs are the current gold standard for pain relief."
"They also cause sedation and feelings of euphoria. Heroin and morphine are frequently taken via intravenous injection, but many prescription opioids, particularly for long-term pain conditions, are consumed orally. Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of opioid-overdose-related deaths."
"The most recent spike in deaths is due to overdose on synthetic opioids such as the extremely potent painkiller fentanyl, which saw a 10-fold increase between 2013 and 2017. The so-called opioid epidemic kills an estimated 130 individuals from the United States each day. Cocaine is a psychostimulant that is derived from the coca plant."
"The most common routes of administration are insufflation , inhalation , but it can also be solubilized and injected or taken via transbuccal and oral administration by chewing the leaves of the plant. Cocaine is considered to be a potent sympathomimetic, meaning the substance activates the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the physiology of a person on cocaine will be similar to an activated “fight-or-flight” response: elevated heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, and increased respiration."
"Cocaine is a Schedule II substance. Although it has a very high addiction and harm potential, it has a handful of medicinal applications as well. For example, it is a potent local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor, so it is often used in surgery, especially in facial or nose surgeries."
"Psychedelics are the class of drugs formerly called hallucinogens. They can be either natural, such as psilocybin which is derived from mushrooms, or man-made, in the case of lysergic acid diethylamide . Psychedelics can cause a person to experience visual distortions, synesthesia, an altered sense of self , or sometimes a sudden connection with nature or a higher power."
"Although psychedelics have been used for centuries in religious ceremonies, they have had a troubled history in the US. The adoption of LSD  by the counterculture movement during the 1970’s, secret CIA funded research, and some loosely regulated research ethics in the clinical setting all led to notoriously negative press regarding the substance, tainted the general public opinion about this class of drugs. Since 2010, there has been a growing body of evidence supporting the notion that psychedelics can serve a therapeutic purpose, most notably in treating psychiatric conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder, terminal illness-related depression, and drug addiction."
"Comparing different drugs based on their potential for drug dependence and the amount of physical harm that they cause reveals that drugs such as heroin are classified as more dangerous. The mesolimbic dopamine pathway within the brain underlies reward . As a reminder, our reward signaling neural circuitry starts with the ventral tegmental area ."
"Located in the midbrain, the VTA contains neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine . These VTA DA neurons send their axonal projections predominantly into two main areas. The mesolimbic pathway consists of dopamine producing neurons that release dopamine onto the cells in the nucleus accumbens , serving as the major pathway by which reward is mediated by the brain."
"A separate group of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA project to the prefrontal cortex in the mesocortical pathway. Drugs of abuse act on this pathway, causing drugs to cause heightened feelings of reward, making it more likely that individuals engage with these substances. The nucleus accumbens can be subdivided into two portions called the nucleus accumbens shell and nucleus accumbens core, each with their own circuitry and functions."
"The nucleus accumbens shell functions in the “wanting” involved in drug addiction, as well as reward and reinforcement. The nucleus accumbens core, however, functions in the motor functions related to reward and reinforcement. Using microdialysis, it is possible to measure the dopamine concentration in the NAc during performance of some behavioral tasks."
"In studies with rats, engaging in rewarding activities such as eating or sex results in increased release of dopamine in the NAc. Similarly we see that release of dopamine into the human NAc is enhanced when we engage in activities we enjoy: binge eating sugary stuff, having sex, even playing video games. Notably, many drugs of abuse such as cocaine or amphetamine can induce a similar overflow of dopamine release when an animal is exposed to the drug."
"Many drugs of abuse cause a sensitized increased in dopamine release, meaning that there is an increase in dopamine release. Sensitization is a phenomenon in which there is an increased effect of the drug with chronic exposure. The increased dopamine release at the nucleus accumbens causes an increase in dopaminergic signaling, which can then lead to structural plasticity."
"Repeated administrations of multiple drugs of abuse causes cellular plasticity within the nucleus accumbens and other structures within the reward pathway, by increasing dendritic spine density. Dendritic spines are small protrusions off the main dendritic shaft of neurons. They serve as the excitatory synaptic inputs for these cells, increasing excitability."
"Notably, though the increase in dendritic spine density is observed following administration of multiple drugs of abuse, it is not a universal structural change as opiates do not produce the same dendritic spine increase. Cocaine acts on a molecular level by functioning as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, preventing the transporter protein from clearing the neurotransmitters such as dopamine out of the synapse. This leads to increased concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex."
"This increased dopamine results in a greater likelihood that the postsynaptic receptors get activated. Amphetamine acts similarly to cocaine at the synapse, blocking the dopamine transporter and preventing reuptake into the presynaptic cell. Amphetamine can also mimic dopamine at the dopaminergic synapses, binding to dopaminergic receptors."
"Opioids being to GABAergic neurons, causing them to hyperpolarize and suppress release of GABA onto dopaminergic VTA neurons, disinhibiting the VTA neurons and increasing dopamine release onto downstream targets. Although the cannabis plant contains several chemical substances, the main psychoactive ingredient is delta-9-tetrohydrocannabinol, or THC for short. THC, once it enters the bloodstream, is capable of activating receptors that our body uses endogenously, called the cannabinoid receptors ."
"THC inhibits activity of GABAergic neurons that synapse on the dopaminergic VTA neurons, disinhibiting the VTA neurons and increasing dopaminergic signaling. Pharmacologically, nicotine has specificity as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , excitatory ionotropic receptors that are expressed widely across the body. When nicotine binds to VTA neurons,it activates the cells and causes an increase in dopamine release."
"Nicotine can also increase glutamatergic activation originating from the prefrontal cortex onto VTA neurons. Collectively, this acts to increase activity of VTA neurons and increase release of dopamine at downstream targets. Ethanol is a tiny molecule with properties similar to water, meaning that ethanol can diffuse easily through cell membranes."
"Whereas other chemical substances often have highly specific molecular or protein targets, ethanol has several. Ethanol activates dopamine neurons within the ventral tegmental area, causing an increase in dopamine release at the nucleus accumbens. Further, alcohol acts to inhibit GABAergic neurons within the VTA, disinhibiting the dopamine neurons and increasing their signaling."
"Pharmacologically speaking, tolerance can be defined as a decrease in the action of a drug due to repeat exposure. This phenomenon happens as a result of homeostatic adaptations that the body undergoes when it has been exposed to a substance for a prolonged period of time. In a person who is tolerant, they must take progressively higher doses of the drug to experience a desired effect."
"For a drug naive person, someone with no experience with the drug, a low dose of drug may have a strong effect. However, for a person who has become tolerant to the effects of the drug, that same low dose will produce a small drug effect. There are different forms of tolerance that a person can experience."
"In metabolic tolerance, there is a decrease in the amount of the drug that gets to the site of action. The body becomes more efficient at eliminating the substance. Since exogenous substances usually get degraded by enzymatic reactions, an increase in the activity or number of enzymes will decrease the amount of the substance that is capable of acting."
"The most common example of metabolic tolerance is seen in frequent alcohol use. The main psychoactive substance found in alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, or liquor is ethanol. Our liver, which filters circulating blood, contains enzymes which break down chemicals in the blood."
"Specifically, the standard degradation process of ethanol uses two enzymes. The first of which, called alcohol dehydrogenase, oxidizes molecules of ethanol into the toxic byproduct acetaldehyde. The second step uses the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to convert the acetaldehyde into acetic acid, a generally harmless compound  that is used by the body in a biochemical reaction that drives the citric acid cycle."
"Because most alcohol is taken via oral consumption, ethanol is subject to first-pass metabolism before reaching systemic circulation. However, after prolonged exposure to alcohol, the body undergoes homeostatic compensatory changes. The two liver enzymes responsible for degradation of ethanol increase in either function or amount."
"When these metabolic enzymes become upregulated, the circulating ethanol in the bloodstream becomes broken down more rapidly and more efficiently, resulting in a decrease in the amount of ethanol that reaches general circulation, and consequently, the brain. This explains why people who have never drank alcohol  may experience a stronger drug effect compared to someone who drinks regularly. It also accounts for why there is some genetic variation between a person’s sensitivity to alcohol’s intoxicating effect, as enzyme efficiency is partially encoded by genetics."
Another way by which tolerance can manifest itself is through changes at the level of the molecular components of cells. This type of tolerance is called cellular tolerance. This tolerance leads to a decreased sensitivity to the substance.
"Cellular tolerance can be characterized by a decrease in receptor expression after chronic exposure to an agonist. When the opioid etorphine is present in the body, it activates the opioid receptors. Frequent exposure to etorphine causes a molecular change in the receptors, which leads to internalization, the process by which cell surface-expressed receptors become taken into the cell."
"Since etorphine is only able to activate receptors on the surface, these internalized receptors diminish the strength of the etorphine signal, which manifests as tolerance. By downregulating the number of receptors that are expressed on the surface, the cell reacts to the environment by becoming less responsive in the face of drug. Sometimes, the body physiologically prepares for the drug effect before the drug is even present."
"The way it does this is to initiate an opposite somatic effect from what the drug is expected to do. This “reverse” effect is likely a protective mechanism to minimize the drug effect, and these anticipatory bodily changes can be precipitated by drug-associated cues. For example, heroin causes analgesia."
"Cues that predict administration of the drug, such as preparation for an intravenous injection or being in a physical environment where drug is frequently administered, can cause the reverse physiological effect, hyperalgesia. Because of this, a person may need to take more drug to overcome the anticipatory changes. This unconscious form of learning leads to a form of tolerance that is dependent on Pavolvian cues; this is called conditional tolerance."
"If not accounted for, conditioned tolerance can have potentially lethal side effects. A clinical description  of a patient with pancreatic cancer describes one such “failure” of tolerance. Bedridden and suffering from tremendous pain, a man was regularly given morphine in his bedroom, dark and filled with humming apparatus for his medical care."
"As expected, he developed a tolerance towards the morphine, requiring higher and higher doses in order to inhibit pain. One day, he went into the brightly lit living room to receive his normal dose of painkiller. Soon after, he died from opioid overdose."
"Sensitization is a phenomenon related to tolerance, but the polar opposite: instead of a drug effect being lessened after chronic exposure, a sensitized person experiences an increase in drug effect. Nicotine as well as many psychostimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine can produce psychomotor sensitization after repeated dosings. Psychomotor sensitization can be measured through crossovers ."
"Animals displaying sensitization will show significantly more crossovers compared to non-sensitized animals. This sensitization can be long-lasting, remaining for up to one year following the last dose of drug. “Why do some people transition from user to addict?"
"” Many people are able to use the most addictive substances such as cocaine or heroin casually without ever becoming an addict. For these people, their drug use pattern can remain recreational, even though they may use the substance frequently and report a great sense of satisfaction when they use the drug. On the other hand, there are some people who have a very high propensity to quickly becoming a pathological addict."
"One of the big challenges in drug abuse research is to understand the differences between these two populations. What factors, either environmental or genetic, are protective and prevent the transition from casual drug user to compulsive drug addict? And what are some ways we can use this knowledge to help addicts find ways to break their pattern of harmful compulsive drug seeking and drug use?"
One possible way to get at the answer is to create animal models of drug dependence and try to determine the nature of the underlying biological changes that contribute to the addiction-like pattern. Do some cellular circuits change permanently? Are certain genes or proteins upregulated or downregulated?
"Can pharmacological or behavioral interventions change drug-taking or drug-seeking behavior? One of the most instructive non-human animal models of drug use disorder is called self-administration. In a self-administration experiment, the subject  gets a surgical implantation of an indwelling intravenous tube that is connected to a pump."
"Then, the subject is put into an operant conditioning chamber. When they press the lever or poke their nose into a hole, the pump triggers, resulting in an infusion of drug directly into the bloodstream. This experimental paradigm closely mimics human drug seeking behavior."
"For example, rats and mice will very quickly learn to press on the levers for intravenous infusions of cocaine and morphine. Many of them will give themselves drugs even despite severe adverse consequences, such as enduring foot shock—arguably similar to human behavioral patterns where addicts may do all kinds of behaviors for access to drugs. Monkeys, if given the option to self administer for cocaine, must be restricted in the amount of drug they receive: if given unrestricted access, they give themselves so much cocaine that they have seizures and die."
"A second experimental test created to study drug abuse is called conditioned place preference  . A CPP test works on the principle that animals learn to associate certain environments with positive feelings, and will prefer to spend significantly more time in those environments. To conduct CPP, a three-room testing chamber is used."
"This experimental chamber has two large rooms, each with characteristics that are unique to that room. For example, one room may have mesh flooring with dark-colored walls, while the other room may have woodchip flooring with light-colored walls. The two rooms are connected by a smaller, neutral room, and the rooms can be isolated from another by means of a dividing door."
"To conduct CPP, an animal will be given the drug of interest, then placed into one of the two rooms, where they are free to explore the room, but cannot leave. As a control, at a different time, they will be injected with an innocuous solution and placed into the other room. On test day, the animal will be put into the neutral middle room, and given the opportunity to move freely between the two chambers."
"If the animal developed positive associations with the room where they experienced the drug effect, then they will choose to spend significantly more time in that room. On the other hand, if they experienced negatived conditioned place feelings associated with that room, they will avoid being in the room. Whereas self-administration assesses “drug seeking”, CPP measures “drug liking”."
"Below are three major biology-driven hypotheses that have been proposed to explain drug addiction. It’s important to note that none of them tell the complete story—otherwise drug addiction will have already been cured! Also, these theories are not mutually exclusive from one another. A likely answer to curing addiction probably incorporates some combination of these approaches in addition to societal policy changes."
"What drives addicts to behave in the way they do? One of the earlier theories put forward to explain addiction is the hedonia hypothesis proposed in the late 1970s by Roy Wise. The hedonia hypothesis hinges on the assumption that dopamine is the “pleasure neurotransmitter”, and that any substance or behavior that increases dopamine will be desirable."
"The theory is supported by some behavioral data. For example, using microdialysis, it was found that dopamine release by the mesolimbic pathway increases in the presence of many drugs of abuse. Additionally, administration of dopamine antagonists are able to block some drug taking behavior."
"This dopamine-centric approach to drug use disorder was so influential that pharmaceutical companies, while developing novel antidepressants, quickly dismissed drugs that increased dopamine out of fear of the risk of addiction potential. Despite the attractiveness of the straightforward “pleasure neurotransmitter” model, the dopamine hypothesis does not give us the whole picture. For one, dopamine release at the mesolimbic pathway is only notable for psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine."
"But there are plenty of stimulants that still produce the significant overflow of dopamine without causing any rewarding sensation. Furthermore, if dopamine is the signal that mediates the positive hedonic feelings, one might predict that by blocking dopamine receptors chronically, you can also prevent long-term cocaine addiction, but this therapeutic strategy isn’t very useful. Many of the most popular misconceptions about dopamine that you frequently see in the media take this early hypothesis as the truth."
"It even was featured as the cover of a 1997 Time magazine. That same year in an interview with the original proponent of the hedonia hypothesis published in Science, Roy Wise agreed with recent results that his model was incomplete. A more recent theory to explain drug addiction is a model developed by researchers Terry Robinson and Kent Berridge from the University of Michigan."
"Under their model of drug use, initially a person takes a drug because they like the positive, euphoria-producing side effects of the substance. But after chronic exposure to the substance, the person becomes fixated on obtaining the drug rather than how the drug makes them feel. At this point, they continue to use the drug even though they no longer enjoy the drug to the same degree that they once did."
"Instead of “liking” the drug, the addict fixates on “wanting” the drug. The incentive sensitization model suggests that the drug-exposed brain develops an increased sensitivity to drugs, but also more importantly, drug related cues. Pavlovian learning takes place when an addict takes a drug."
"Each drug has an associated set of cues, and reexposure to those cues can trigger relapse. Over repeated pairings, those cues trigger a progressively stronger response. Their model accounts for why it is difficult to remain abstinent from an addictive drug for long durations of time."
"Despite a decrease in drug seeking behaviors, many addicts eventually relapse, or return to the previous destructive pattern of drug use. One phenomenon that makes staying drug free difficult is the observation that prolonged abstinence can increase the intensity of drug cravings. This is called incubation of craving, and is seen with several different classes of drugs, notably, nicotine."
"Much of our current understanding of addiction is based on the principles that repeated drug use leads to biological changes in the brain that resemble aberrant learning. This model for drug addiction is called the Brain Disease Model of Addiction. Genetics has a strong influence on the likelihood that someone develops a disease, and addiction is no different."
"Inherent risk-taking behaviors, magnitude of a drug effect, and risk of relapse are all modified by genetics. One of the major implications of this model is that compulsive drug use and seeking is not a choice that a person makes. Addicts are not the way they are because of some poor moral guidance or a weakness of willpower."
"Addicts compulsively seek drug because of some underlying circuitry of their brain that makes cessation difficult. One substantial accomplishment of this model is that public policy has adjusted to increase access to mental health resources for addicts to help cover the financial challenges of recovery programs , and to improve the outcomes of nonviolent drug offenders as they reintegrate with society outside of prisons. This model is not without fault, however."
"The major criticism of this framework to explain compulsive drug use is that most people stop their addictive use patterns by themselves spontaneously without any treatment. Another harm of the Brain Disease Model of Addiction is that it puts heavy emphasis on biochemical therapies rather than on a public policy approach to drug addiction treatment. Lastly, this model has not produced a successful therapeutic strategy to help with addiction."
"Sexual differentiation is the process by which a person develops into either a male or a female. For the purpose of this chapter, the content will be based on a male/female binary to introduce the basic concepts of reproductive development. However, it is important to recognize that in real life, chromosomal sex, physical sex, and gender exist on a continuum and cannot always be simplified into a two-structure system."
"Gender is a cultural variable with behaviors and attributes that are associated with being masculine or feminine and is determined by interactions between genes, hormones, life experiences, and cultural expectations. During development, the body and the brain undergo either: A) feminization and de-masculinization or B) masculinization and de-feminization. In most cases, the differentiated brain will lead to behaviors that correspond to the differentiated gonads."
"In humans, DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes. One set of 23 chromosomes comes from the mother and the other set comes from the father. Twenty-two pairs are called autosomal chromosomes."
"These chromosome are similar in length and have the same genes present at the same location regardless of if they are received from the mother or father. However, for all genes, the allele, or version, present for each gene may be different from each parent. The last pair of chromosomes is responsible for determining if an individual becomes a male or female; these are called the sex chromosomes."
"In humans, the sex chromosomes are named either X or Y. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell from the father fuses with an egg cell from the mother. All egg cells contain one X sex chromosome."
"Sperm cells contain either one X or one Y chromosome, which means chromosomal sex in humans is determined by the sperm. If a sperm carrying an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting fetus will be XX and a female, whereas if a sperm carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting fetus will be XY and a male. The presence of the Y chromosome signals for the formation of testes in the fetus."
The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome . There is a gene on the Y chromosome called the sex-determining region  of the Y chromosome. The SRY gene is required for masculinization of the embryonic gonads.
"Other genes on the Y chromosome are also important in sex determination and in male physiology, however we will focus on the SRY gene. The SRY gene encodes for a protein called the testis-determining factor , which causes the embryonic gonads to differentiate into the testes. The testes then begin secreting both testosterone and a hormone called the Müllerian inhibiting substance ."
"Testosterone causes Wolffian ducts to develop into the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. MIS causes the Müllerian ducts to degenerate. The presence of testosterone also results in the development of the prostate gland and penis."
"Because XY males only have one copy of the X chromosome, they are more at risk for X-linked diseases. In females, when the SRY gene and secreted hormones are absent, the gonads differentiate into the ovaries, the Müllerian ducts develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina, and the Wolffian ducts degenerate. There are a number of disorders that result from chromosomal abnormalities."
"In Klinefelter Syndrome, individuals have an XXY genotype. Due to the presence of a Y chromosome, individuals with Klinefelter Syndrome have a “male” appearance. The additional X chromosome causes the individual to have less body hair, small testes, wide hips, long arms and legs, more breast tissue, and a female pubic hair pattern."
"The additional X chromosome causes many individuals with Klinefelter’s Syndrome to be infertile. In Jacobs Syndrome, also called XYY Syndrome, individuals have an XYY genotype. Again, due to the presence of a Y chromosome, these individuals typically have a “male” appearance."
"Individuals may also be taller than average and have an increased risk of learning disabilities. Psychological studies indicate that individuals with XYY Syndrome may have difficulty with impulse control and emotional regulation. Historically, increased testosterone is correlated to increased aggressive behavior in incarcerated males with XYY Syndrome."
"In Trisomy X, also called XXX Syndrome, individuals have an XXX genotype. These individuals have a “female” appearance. Fewer than 10% of individuals that have XXX Syndrome are aware that they have it."
"Symptoms include learning disabilities, wide-spaced eyes, and increased height. Individuals have an increased risk for early menopause. In Turner Syndrome, individuals have an XO genotype."
"The “O” indicates the absence of a chromosome, therefore rather than 2 sex chromosomes, individuals with Turner Syndrome only have 1 X chromosome. The lack of Y chromosome leads to these individuals having a “female” appearance. Other symptoms associated with Turner Syndrome include short stature, webbed neck, low-set ears, and a receding jaw."
"Due to only having one X chromosome, ovaries typically do not form, or form abnormally, and breasts do not develop. Hormone therapy is necessary for the development of a menstrual period and breasts. There is not a corresponding YO genotype, because at least one X chromosome is necessary for life."
"Control of gonadal hormone release relies on activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis. Gonadal hormones are important for development of the body and brain, changes during puberty, and the activation of some behavior in adulthood like reproductive behavior and aggression. As a refresher, the hypothalamus, which is located inferior to the thalamus, integrates information from many regions of the central nervous system and maintains homeostasis in the body."
"The hypothalamic regulation of gonadal hormones and sex behavior is managed via hormone release by the pituitary gland. Gonadal hormone release relies on anterior pituitary function. In the hypothalamus, the parvocellular neurosecretory cells release a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone  into the hypophyseal portal circulation."
"When GnRH reaches the anterior pituitary, it causes the endocrine cells of the pituitary to release luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  into the general circulation. The LH and FSH travel through the circulatory system and can act on the gonads, either the testes in males or ovaries in females. In response to the pituitary hormones, the testes release testosterone, an androgen, and the ovaries release estradiol, an estrogen, into the blood stream."
"After puberty, the LH and FSH are also critical for the maturation of sperm and egg cells. Sex steroid hormones are produced by the gonads . All sex steroid hormones are originally generated from cholesterol."
"Males typically have higher concentrations of androgen sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone and 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone . Androgens are primarily released from the testes. Females typically have higher concentrations of estrogens  and progesterone that are primarily released from the ovaries."
"Importantly, males also have estrogens and progesterone, and females have androgens. The only difference is the relative concentration between males and females. In the synthesis pathway, enzymes are responsible for converting one hormone into another hormone."
"The enzyme 5-α reductase converts testosterone into DHT. DHT is important for masculinization of the body structures. Through just one chemical reaction, the enzyme aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol."
"Once the gonadal hormones are synthesized and enter the circulation, they are able to act on cells that express either androgen receptors or estrogen receptors. Testosterone and estradiol are steroid hormones that can affect target cells through two different mechanisms:  Classical mechanism: Steroid hormones like testosterone and estradiol are able to pass through the phospholipid membrane of a neuron because they are lipophilic. Some neurons express receptors for these hormones."
"Androgen receptors bind androgens like testosterone while estrogen receptors bind estrogens like estradiol. When a hormone binds to a receptor in the neuron, the hormone-receptor complex dimerizes and moves into the nucleus where it can bind to specific promoter sites on the DNA and act as a transcription factor to turn on or off certain genes . Rapid mechanism: Sex steroid hormones can also bind to membrane-bound receptors and can exert more rapid effects within the cell."
"The testes secrete testosterone during the prenatal critical period. The effect of this testosterone is to masculinize and defeminize the brain, body, and behavior, and this is accomplished through the transcription of a specific set of genes. However, many of those genes are not transcribed by the action of androgen receptors interacting with the DNA."
"Instead, when testosterone enters the cell, it does not always bind to androgen receptors. Some neurons also express the enzymes 5-α reductase and aromatase that break testosterone down into its metabolites: DHT and estradiol. In some mammals, like rodents, this conversion of testosterone to estradiol through the actions of the enzyme aromatase is the main process by which neurons and the brain are masculinized."
"The estrogen receptors cause the transcription of masculinizing genes. Therefore, somewhat surprisingly, even though estrogen is typically thought of as a ‘female’ hormone, its actions during development are responsible for much of the masculinization that occurs in the brain in some animals. The brain is by default “female” during development, and requires the testosterone secreted by the testes and converted into estradiol for “male” development."
"It should be noted, though, that estrogen does not appear to have these same masculinizing effects during human development. In addition to differentiating the reproductive duct system, the presence or absence of gonadal steroid hormones during development also differentiates the rest of the body, including the brain. Testosterone causes the brain, body, and behavior of the individual to be masculinized and defeminized."
"The quiescent ovaries do not release hormones which causes the brain, body, and behavior of the individual to be feminized and demasculinized. In the brain, gonadal hormones bind to receptors to alter neuronal function and overall behavior. In many species, males and females have different roles in sexual reproduction when it comes to finding a mate, copulation, birth, nursing, and nurturing offspring."
"It follows that there are differences in structure and function between male and female brains. A sexual dimorphism is a distinct difference in the size or appearance of a structure between the sexes of an animal. In rodents, a sexual dimorphism has been described in the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area  within the hypothalamus."
The SDN-POA is generally 5-8 times larger in male rodents than it is in female rodents. Are there sexual dimorphisms in the human brain? This answer is not clear.
"There may be differences in structures, but the differences are small and controversial. A set of nuclei within the human brain has been studied with regard to sexual dimorphisms called the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus . Within this collection of nuclei, INAH-1, INAH-2, and INAH-3 have been reported to be larger in men than in women, with INAH-3 having the largest difference."
"The function of INAH in sexual behavior is still not well-understood. Importantly, there is a large degree of variability between human brains. This means that even when a sexual dimorphism is observed, it is being observed “on average” across many brains."
"Within this comparison group, there will be brains that do not show a sexual dimorphism or potentially show the exact opposite difference in size. The hormonal effects of secreted testosterone on the brain must take place during a specific time in development, called a critical period. Organizational effects of hormones lead to major, generally irreversible, aspects of cell and tissue differentiation."
"Organizational effects take place during critical periods like prenatal development and puberty. In adulthood, the same hormones trigger physiological or behavioral responses called activational effects that are reversible and short-lived. The early role of testosterone is an organizational effect and results in a permanent change in the nervous system and therefore behavior."
"The androgens released by the testes enter cells of the SDN-POA and are converted into estradiol through the actions of the enzyme aromatase. The estradiol within the SDN-POA acts to masculinize the structure of the SDN-POA by preventing cell death, causing the SDN-POA to be larger in males than in females. Due to the female ovaries being inactive during development , the female SDN-POA has a smaller, feminized structure due to the normal cell death that occurs during development."
"If testosterone is experimentally administered to a female during the organizational critical period, the SDN-POA will be masculinized and larger, however if the testosterone is experimentally administered to a female after the organizational critical period, the structure of the SDN-POA will remain small and feminized. Clearly, the presence of hormones during the organizational critical period is critical for the masculinization of the rodent brain. Below are examples of conditions in humans that demonstrate the organizational effects of gonadal steroid hormones on both the brain and body."
"Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome   affects the development of the reproductive organs. Individuals with this syndrome do not have functional androgen receptors. Therefore, circulating androgens cannot bind to androgen receptors which affects the development of secondary sexual characteristics, causing these individuals to have a feminized appearance."
"They have an XY genotype but have genitalia that look female at birth, with the presence of a vagina, but do not have ovaries or a uterus. As a result, they do not menstruate and cannot become pregnant. Due to the presence of the Y chromosome, individuals with AIS have undescended, but typically functional testes."
"Many XY individuals that have AIS only discover their syndrome during puberty when they do not experience their first menses. Upon understanding their biology, many still prefer to call themselves women, dress like women, and choose men as their sexual partners. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  affects individuals with an XX genotype."
"During development, the adrenal glands of these individuals produce an excess of androgens. The higher circulating androgen levels results in masculinization of the external genitalia to varying degrees resulting in intersex conditions with ambiguous genitalia structure. These individuals still have ovaries and do not have testes ."
"In many cases, these individuals are treated medically with hormones and raised as female. Lastly, a group of individuals in the Dominican Republic referred to as the “Guevedoces” are XY genotypic individuals that are born with a feminized appearance and undescended testes that are assigned a female sex at birth. These individuals have a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme 5-α-reductase."
"5-α-reductase is typically responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone , the hormone that is responsible for the development of male external genitalia. However, at puberty there is a surge in testosterone in these individuals that overcomes the 5-α-reductase enzyme deficiency, allowing in the growth of male sex organs. This causes these individuals that were raised as females to start growing a penis."
"“Guevedoces” literally translates to “penis at 12 years” in Spanish. This phenomenon has also been observed in a small population with Papua New Guinea. Culturally, this has major implications in gender roles for these individuals as only 2 genders are typically recognized, though they are described as a third sex."
"Activational effects of gonadal steroid hormones occur during adulthood and are short-lived and reversible. Examples of activational effects of gonadal steroid hormones include sexual behavior patterns and ovulation. Removal of the activating hormone will cause the behavior to stop, but replacement later will cause the response to begin again because the brain has previously been organized to produce those behaviors when hormones are present."
"Interestingly, maternal and paternal behavior have both been shown to change the brain in various ways such as changes in dendritic branching and somatosensory maps through experiential plasticity. The role of activational hormones can be demonstrated by adult castration in male rats. Healthy males with intact testes will show sexual behavior when placed with a female rat."
"Castration, the removal of the testes, will cause males to stop showing sexual behavior because the activating hormone, testosterone, is no longer present. However, if the castrated males receive testosterone replacement, they will resume showing sexual behavior. The sexual behavior brain circuit was organized during development by exposure to gonadal hormones, and in adulthood that circuit can be activated by testosterone."
"The adult behavior can only be seen when the activating hormone is present. Long-term attachment, which includes pair bonding with a sexual partner and parental bonding with offspring, are naturally rewarding behaviors in some species of mammals. Much of the research on social attachment and mammalian pair bonding has been done using voles as the animal model."
"Voles are useful because there are closely related species that display considerably different reproductive behavior. The prairie vole  that is indigenous to central North America is an atypical rodent that displays highly social behavior, has monogamous relationships after mating, and will cohabitate and share parental duties such as mutual resource collections, nest building, and care for their young. The montane vole, on the other hand, has a slightly different geographical location and is a non-social species."
"They do not form pair bonds and only the female cares for the young. An experimental test called the partner preference paradigm can be used to assess vole monogamy. Here, a three-chamber testing apparatus is used where a test vole is placed in a central chamber."
"In the other two chambers are voles who have been harnessed into their rooms, unable to leave. The test vole is then free to move between any of the three chambers. When a prairie vole has mated with one of the harnessed voles, they will choose to spend more time with their “partner” vole compared to the novel “stranger” vole, whereas a montane vole will choose to spend most of their time alone and spend very little time with any other animal."
"Differences in brain and behavior can be studied between these species to determine why they display these different reproductive behaviors. Not only do mated prairie voles prefer the company of their partner, they also demonstrate behaviors similar to some human romantic relationships. For example, mated prairie voles living together display selective aggression against a stranger, “intruder” voles, a behavior called “mate-guarding”."
"They also spend significant time mutually caring for their young, their pair bonding can be modified by psychoactive substance use, and they show increased anxiety when they are separated from their partner vole. Comparing between monogamous and promiscuous species has allowed researchers to identify several neurotransmitter signals that are implicated in pair bonding. Oxytocin and vasopressin seem to play important roles in vole pair bonding, as inhibition of either of these signals decrease partner preference."
"Additionally, differences in dopamine receptor levels and corticotropin releasing factors are observed between vole species. The hypothalamus is a critical region for the formation of social bonds. Magnocellular neurosecretory cells, the larger type of neurosecretory cell compared to parvocellular neurons, send axons from the hypothalamus down to pituitary stalk where they terminate on capillaries of the general circulation located within the posterior pituitary."
"Therefore, unlike the control of stress and gonadal hormones, where the hypothalamic neurons release hormones onto anterior pituitary endocrine cells, release of hormones from the posterior pituitary comes directly from hypothalamic neurons. The magnocellular neurons synthesize and release oxytocin and vasopressin, two neuropeptides, into the blood. Oxytocin, often referred to as the love hormone, promotes social bonding."
"It is released during reproduction and also causes uterine contractions during labor and the milk letdown reflex after birth. Vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone, plays a role in regulating salt concentration in the blood by acting on the kidneys to promote water retention and decrease urine production. Further, it constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure."
"Vasopressin has also been shown to be involved in bonding, parenting, territoriality, and mate-guarding in some animals. Biochemically, vasopressin is very similar to oxytocin, as they are both nine amino acid peptides differing by only two residues. In the social prairie voles, oxytocin and vasopressin are released by the hypothalamus in response to mating and act on regions of the reward and limbic systems."
"Specifically, there are increases in oxytocin release in female prairie voles following mating. Female prairie voles express higher levels of oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens compared to montane voles. Oxytocin binding to oxytocin receptors within the nucleus accumbens is necessary for females to form pair bonds and may reinforce the association of reward with a partner."
"This is supported by experimental evidence that when oxytocin is administered to females, there is an increase in pair bond formation. Female montane voles have decreased oxytocin receptors within the nucleus accumbens, and thus do not form pair bonds. Oxytocin does not have the same effects in male prairie voles."
"Male prairie voles have an increase in vasopressin release following mating. The male prairie voles express higher levels of vasopressin receptors in the ventral pallidum compared to montane voles. When vasopressin is given to males, it increases pair bond formation, and when a vasopressin antagonist is administered prior to mating, pair bond formation is prevented."
"Vasopressin has no effect on female prairie voles. The nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum are both located in the basal ganglia and are involved in the limbic loop, which is responsible for processing of emotions, rewards, and motivation. An interesting experiment was done that overexpressed vasopressin receptors in the ventral pallidum of male montane voles."
"The simple manipulation of this one protein completely changed the behavior of the monogamous montane voles such that they now behaved like prairie voles by forming pair bonds and helping to take care of young. Oxytocin, vasopressin, and the reward system also appear to be important for bonding in humans. When presented with pictures of either their own children or partners, subjects in an fMRI show increased activation in regions like the ventral tegmental area and striatum compared to when viewing pictures of friends."
"These regions are also known to express oxytocin and vasopressin receptors, and the hormones are released during times of bond formation, like breastfeeding and intercourse. Love can be thought of as an intensely strong attachment towards a person , a thing , or concept . However, it is very difficult to put a strict biological definition on these varied concepts of love."
"This section focuses on interpersonal love, of which there are several unique forms, each resulting in different behavioral outcomes. For example, romantic love drives physical attraction, lust, and sexual activity. Parental love, on the other hand, encourages self-sacrifice and hyper-attentiveness towards a newborn."
"Some behaviors are shared between the two forms of love, such as respect. Romantic love drives much of human behavior and has been documented thoroughly in the arts all the way from Homer’s Iliad, through Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, up to modern Taylor Swift. The majority of human societies have embraced social monogamy, the romantic relationship characterized by a pair of people who share resources, parenting duties, and exhibit preferential mating."
"Outside of humans however, only 9% of mammalian species form socially monogamous pairs, while at least 75% of bird species maintain socially monogamous relationships . Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and a leader in the field of love research, suggests that love can be divided into three closely interconnected components."
"These three are guided in part by different signaling pathways, and lead to somewhat different behavioral outcomes. Lust  refers to a very strong desire for sexual gratification. These behaviors are largely driven by the actions of the sex hormones testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, released downstream of activation of the HPG axis."
"Both testosterone and estradiol contribute to sex-seeking behaviors in men and women, where increasing testosterone levels drive up sexual desire. The amygdala also plays a significant role in mediating lust, and lesions may either result in hypersexuality  or a decrease in response to socially-derived sex cues. Attraction is characterized by high energy-investment and preoccupation towards a small number of people."
"From an evolutionary perspective, attraction may have developed to discriminate between multiple reproductive partners, allowing the focusing of limited resources towards fewer partners. In Fisher’s theory, attraction is strongly related to the action of dopamine and norepinephrine. In humans, the reward circuitry is involved in feelings of love."
"Using fMRI, Fisher presented pictures of a patient’s romantic partner to them and identified increases in the blood flow to dopaminergic midbrain areas such as the ventral tegmental area and the striatum. This finding compares with imaging studies that observed increases in blood flow to insula, premotor, and hypothalamus as well as striatum in response to highly erotic, sexual imagery. These studies suggest that romantic love and lust have different driving neural structures underlying these behaviors."
"Norepinephrine functions to increase attention, alertness, and energy, which accounts for the exhilarated feeling you may feel when spending time with a potential partner. Attachment is the long-term association with an individual accompanied by feelings of comfort and emotional stability. Attachment also contributes to behaviors that maximize offspring survivability, such as sharing parenthood responsibilities and protectiveness towards offspring."
"The major neurochemical drivers of this form of love are oxytocin and vasopressin. Parental love refers to instinctive affection towards one’s offspring. Parental love behaviors include nurturing , protecting , and preparing one’s young for their adult life ."
"In evolutionary theory, parental love serves to improve the odds of passing of one’s genes through the following generation. Most large mammals  are K-selected species, which benefit most from a small number of high-quality offspring that require substantial parental investment, as opposed to large numbers of offspring with little investment. An extension of parental love is familial love or kinship, the protection and preferential support of one’s extended genetic relations."
"Because blood relatives share common genes, increasing the survivability of these family members has benefits for passing genes to the next generation. In the words of the geneticist Jack Haldane, “I’d gladly give my life for two brothers or eight cousins. ”  Many behaviors related to mammalian motherhood are accompanied by changes in neural activity."
"Nursing, for instance, is feeding behavior that is regulated through a positive feedback cycle. Offspring suckling activates the mother’s somatosensory afferents. Through a series of oxytocin-dependent circuits across the hypothalamus, suckling ultimately increases lactation through the milk letdown reflex."
"Auditory sensory inputs, such as the sounds of a crying baby, can also trigger this reflex. Sometimes, just thinking about the baby can induce letdown. Some changes are dependent on neural plasticity."
"For example, after childbirth, the auditory areas of rodents rewire to become more sensitive to high frequency sounds. This adaptation allows the mothers to better detect the ultrasonic vocalizations that are emitted by offspring when they are distressed or hungry. Olfactory areas also change in order to become more sensitive to the particular odorants given off by their young, allowing them to better identify their offspring."
"In humans, these olfactory changes result in decreased aversion towards traditionally aversive stimuli  when they originate from their children. Sleep is such an important part of our lives that a lack of it strongly correlates with negative outcomes on nearly every measure of health. People who sleep less than approximately 7 hours a night are at a greater risk for heart disease, stroke, asthma, arthritis, depression, and diabetes."
"Nearly 20% of all car crashes, both fatal and nonfatal, are attributed to drowsy driving. The cancer research branch of the World Health Organization has determined that disruption of regular sleep is “probably carcinogenic to humans”, putting it in the same risk category as the infectious agents malaria and human papillomavirus , as well as the biochemical weapon mustard gas. Sexual health is affected by sleep deprivation as well, as men with the worst sleeping habits have significantly lower sperm counts, decreased circulating testosterone, and even testicular shrinkage."
"Despite all that we know about the benefits of sleep, sleep is often the first time commitment to get cut, often getting squeezed as people stay awake later while waking up sooner. Consider that the CDC estimates that more than a third of American adults fail to get enough sleep each night. Almost 70% of college students fail to get the recommended amount of nightly sleep, and half of all college students report experiencing daytime sleepiness as a result."
The current medical recommendation is 7-9 hours of sleep each night. But why is sleep so important? It is possible to study sleep using a combination of techniques; the output of sleep studies are visualized on a polysomnogram .
"Several physiological measures are taken in a polysomnogram, including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygenation level, respiratory depth and pattern, muscle activity, eye movement, and one of major interest to neuroscientists: brain wave activity. While everyone knows what sleep is, it is useful to try to more precisely define sleep as a biological function. Sleep is characterized by a decrease in physical activity, a decoupling from external inputs, and changes in brain wave activity."
"Compared to waking behavior, a person’s physical activity is greatly decreased when they sleep. While asleep, people are relatively inactive and as a result, the body uses about 10% less energy. This is not to say that people do not completely cease all movement during sleep."
"It is very common to readjust posture many times in the middle of the night. Some people may grind their teeth together or talk in their sleep, sometimes carrying on full conversations by themselves! About 15% of people have experienced somnambulism, or sleepwalking: full on wake-like behaviors, such as navigating down a flight of stairs or preparing a sandwich, performed entirely in the absence of intent of memory recall. Despite these rare occurrences of physical activity, the average movement of the person over a night’s rest is still less than their average activity when awake."
"When we sleep, our conscious brains are “distanced” from the outside world. Sleep causes a heightened threshold for detection of stimuli, so we do not receive the same magnitude of inputs from our sensory systems as when we’re awake. This is why someone else might have to talk loudly or even shake you physically to wake you up."
"Lastly, sleep was once thought to be a period of time characterized by low brain activity. After all, the person looks like they are not moving. Shouldn’t brain activity be reflective of that decreased state of activity?"
"With the advancement of EEG technology in 1924, and the rise of sleep laboratories in the 1970s, scientists who studied brain activity noticed that, at different times throughout the night, the brain of a sleeping person was very similar in activity to the brain of an awake person! Electroencephalography  is used to measure brain rhythms through recording electrical activity at the scalp, making it a non-invasive and painless tool to detect brain activity. EEG detects the general activity of the cortex by measuring small  fluctuations in voltage. This technique does not measure electrical activity of a single neuron, but rather measures the electrical activity of a large population of neurons, on the order of thousands of cells, in order to generate a signal that is large enough to detect."
"An EEG reading depicts differences in both amplitude and frequency over time. An increase in amplitude on an EEG indicates a higher degree of synchronous activity of cortical neurons, whereas the frequency of an EEG indicates how often neural synchrony occurs. EEG is used to measure patterns of brain activity during different behavioral states and is used in both research and in the diagnosis of various neurological conditions such as sleep disorders and epilepsy."
"Though EEG is used to measure brain rhythms, the function of these rhythms is unknown, but they have been correlated to different behavioral states such as wakefulness, sleep, attentiveness, and various pathologies. Brain rhythms generated through synchronous neuron activity can be created through two different mechanisms. Cells within the thalamus have been demonstrated to have pacemaker properties that allow it to generate rhythmical cortical activity."
"Collections of cells can also generate intrinsic rhythms through their collective activity. Each night when we go to sleep, our brains undergo a very stereotyped pattern of activity changes. At times, neurons in the cortex exhibit synchronized patterns of firing."
"And at other times, cortical activity looks very similar to an awake brain. We can divide sleep roughly into two different phases depending on one of the first physiological measures that sleep scientists studied: eye movement. A study published in 1953 used a device to detect eye movement while a person was asleep."
"Interestingly, they noticed that at some points in the night, usually first occurring around three hours after falling asleep, the patient’s eyes would dart rapidly and jerkily back and forth, a pattern of activity that the University of Chicago researchers called rapid eye movement . This first period of REM activity lasted for about 20 minutes, after which the eyes would stop moving again. This activity pattern repeated every hour or two for the rest of the night."
"They used eye movement to separate sleep into two phases: REM sleep, and nonREM sleep . In addition to eye movement, they observed and measured other physiological behaviors. Respiration rate and heart rate both increased during the REM phase of sleep and dipped during NREM sleep."
"They also  woke up patients throughout the two phases of sleep and found that patients were more likely to recall dreams with visual imagery if their REM sleep was interrupted. Those woken during NREM sleep were less likely to recall dreams, hinting that dreaming is more likely to happen during REM sleep. While eye movement could differentiate between two phases of sleep, EEG could further subdivide NREM sleep."
"Using EEG, scientists discovered three distinct NREM phases based on neuron activity patterns: NREM1, NREM2, and NREM3 sleep. Currently, readings collected via EEG are considered to be the gold standard for measuring the stages of sleep. But before we describe EEG traces while asleep, we should describe the EEG of a person who is awake."
"Usually, the awake EEG is dominated by high-frequency waves that increase with attention and mental activity. NREM1 is the earliest stage of sleep. It’s also described as relaxed wakefulness, drowsiness, or light sleep."
"During NREM1, mostly alpha waves are present and a person’s muscles are still somewhat active. Their eyelids may open and close every so often, and they may still respond to questions. Basically, the deeper into NREM1 sleep a person becomes, more waves with lower and lower frequencies start to emerge."
"NREM1 transitions into NREM2, which mostly has theta waves. Lastly, NREM3 occurs, which is also called deep sleep. At this phase of the night, a person’s physiological activity drops to its lowest point of the night: heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and metabolism all reach minimum during NREM3."
"In this stage of sleep, many of the cortical neurons fire in synchronicity with one another, and the subsequent change in potentials cause large amplitude deflections in the EEG, called delta waves. The EEG trace of a person in REM sleep is quite the opposite of what is seen in deep sleep. Instead of large amplitude events at a low frequency, the REM brain has a lot of low amplitude events at a high frequency."
"In fact, the brain in REM sleep has a pattern of activity that is more similar to a person who is awake than asleep! Because of this asynchronous firing activity, REM sleep is sometimes also called paradoxical sleep. To illustrate the stages of sleep that a person experiences each night, we can use a hypnogram. These charts plot time on the x-axis and stage of sleep on the y-axis."
"Awake is represented at the top, and deep sleep is at the bottom. For an average night’s rest, neural activity will fluctuate through the four phases relatively predictably. When a person first falls asleep, they will move from NREM1 down through NREM2 then NREM3, before coming back out of deep sleep progressively back to NREM1."
"After NREM1, they may enter REM sleep before transitioning back through the stages to NREM3 again. This cycle of activity repeats roughly every one and a half hours. People spend a larger percentage of each cycle in deep sleep and very little time in REM sleep early in the night."
"On the other hand, in the last few cycles before waking up from a full night’s rest, people spend a larger percentage of each cycle in REM sleep, and almost no time in deep sleep. All organisms that we know of experience some type of sleep. But we still haven’t figured out exactly why animals sleep."
"Here, we will discuss three theories that have been proposed to explain sleep. None of these theories alone fully explains the complex phenomenon of sleep, and they are not mutually exclusive. The most likely reason we sleep is probably some combination of the following three theories."
The recuperation theory of sleep is centered around the idea that being awake is stressful and exerts a physically demanding toll on the body. The body therefore needs a period of time when energy usage decreases and the body’s natural repair systems can work without disruption. Sleep is how the body “wipes the slate clean” and resets.
"Evidence for the recuperation theory comes from experiments tailored around the idea of looking at what happens when a person doesn’t get sufficient sleep. As anyone who has ever pulled an all-nighter can attest, a single night of sleep deprivation often leads to significant psychological changes, including anxiety, irritability, and mood swings. Staying awake even longer than 24 hours can cause more severe changes in mind state, such as temporary psychosis, hallucinations, or delusions."
"While the support for the recuperation theory is generally true for almost all people, there are about 1% of people who seemingly gain the restorative benefits of sleep, even with fewer than 6 hours of sleep each night. They may wake up at 4:30 in the morning feeling completely refreshed. And yet, despite getting so little sleep, these short sleepers have similar health outcomes with respect to body mass index and psychiatric measures such as depression and overall optimism."
"Something about the circadian rhythms of these short sleepers allows them to “maximize” their sleep efficiency. Many have very short sleep latencies, meaning they fall asleep within minutes after lying down—as quickly as someone with narcolepsy. They also spend a larger percentage of their night in deep sleep and REM sleep while minimizing NREM1 and NREM2."
"The evolutionary adaptation theory is the idea that animal sleep patterns are different across species for reasons that most efficiently benefit each animal. Over millions of years of evolution, individuals with the most ideal sleep patterns have an advantage, and their sleep habits will be selected for in the following generation. For example, consider humans."
"As an animal highly dependent on light and the visual system for navigation and accurate performance of tasks, the dark is a very dangerous time to be active. The risks of wandering off a cliff, running head-first into a tree while escaping a predator, or eating a wrong-colored poisonous berry would all be elevated in the dark. We benefit from behaviors that minimize those risks, such as inactivity until the sun rises."
"During this inactive period, sleeping decreases our metabolism and our body’s need for energy. Humans are just one animal that has an evolutionarily fine-tuned sleep pattern. If you look across the animal kingdom, you’ll find all varieties of sleep behaviors that are best fitted to the needs of the individual species."
"In the wild, for example, dolphins are generally prey. They evolved with the ability to put one half of their brain to “sleep” at a time, allowing the “awake” half to keep an eye out for potential predators. Small prey animals, like squirrels, are faced with the threat of being attacked at night."
"For them, remaining very still, quiet, and hidden improves their survival. Tigers, the top alpha predators in any ecological niche, have almost no predators to hide from, allowing them the luxury of sleeping up to 20 hours a day. This evolutionary adaptation theory argument has a major weakness, however."
"In almost all animals, sleep represents a period of time when an organism’s ability to use their sensory organs to detect the hallmark signs of an approaching predator, like the flurry of feathers from a hungry owl or the soft padding of a wolf footsteps, decreases drastically. For an animal that can’t hide very effectively, sleep represents a period of vulnerability, as they would be unable to sense incoming threats. The brain plasticity theory suggests that the brain needs some period of time for critical changes to occur."
"During sleep, circuits in the brain undergo consolidation processes that are important for memory formation. For example, academic performance and examination grades worsen as a person’s nightly sleep decreases. Both the REM and NREM3 phases of sleep are important for different types of memories and studies suggest that declarative memory, pieces of information about facts, benefits more from slow-wave sleep while procedural memory, the learning of motor skills, is enhanced by REM sleep."
"Although the exact mechanisms about how sleep improves memory are unknown, we theorize that brain activity during sleep helps move memories held in “temporary” areas into areas of stable, long-term storage. The evidence in support of this theory starts with looking at the brains of newborns. When you were first born, during those first few weeks of life, you slept close to nearly 70% of the day, almost 17 hours! At this point in your life, your brain starts to experience all sorts of new sensations: your eyes detect visible light for the first time, the skin feels the air blow past it, and the ears sense new frequencies and combinations of sound waves."
"As a result of these stimuli, scientists hypothesize that your brain undergoes as many learning events as rapidly as possible. This rapid learning helps you remember what you learned each day so you can respond to your environment as you grow up. Almost everyone has experienced difficulty sleeping at some point in their lives, often as a result of stress or anxiety."
"For example, it might be difficult to fall asleep the night before a big interview, or you may wake periodically in the hours before an important early morning flight. There is no strict definition for insomnia. The major clinical symptoms are self-reported measures, such as a dissatisfaction with nightly sleep or a change in daytime behavior, such as sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, or altered mood states."
"The lack of clear diagnostic criteria makes estimating prevalence difficult, but some guesses put the number of people with insomnia close to one third of the US population. Common triggers for insomnia include heightened anxiety, stress, or advanced age. It may also be downstream of other diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, depression, or chronic pain conditions."
"Lifestyle can also be a major risk factor for insomnia, as jet lag and working late-night shifts can disrupt sleep patterns. We can describe insomnia as acting at two stages. Onset insomnia is defined as a difficulty with initially falling asleep."
"People with onset insomnia will frequently lie in bed for a long time before finally drifting off. Maintenance insomnia, however, is a difficulty with remaining asleep. People with maintenance insomnia experience many waking events throughout the middle of the night, or they may wake up very early in the morning and be unable to get back to sleep."
"The two are not exclusive, and people may experience both forms of insomnia in a single night. The most effective treatments for insomnia begin at the level of behavioral changes. Improving sleep habits, such as minimizing arousal states before bedtime, developing a reliable pattern of sleep-wake timing, eliminating caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening, and increasing daytime physical activity can decrease insomnia."
"Prescription medications are less preferred for insomnia treatment, since these drugs are more effective at inducing unconsciousness rather than biological sleep. These drugs can also have adverse psychological side effects such as mood swings and depression, and those adverse effects may be more severe than insomnia itself. Prolonged use of prescription sleep medications can lead to a “rebound effect”, causing a person to experience even worse insomnia when they are unable to get sleep drugs."
"This is called iatrogenic insomnia, and can lead to a cycle of dependence. Unlike the previous two sleep disorders, which result in a deficit of sleep, narcolepsy can be thought of as an “excess” of sleep. More accurately, narcolepsy is inappropriate sleep, and it manifests as frequent sleep attacks throughout the day, each event lasting for seconds or minutes at a time."
"An estimated 1 in 2000 people experience narcolepsy. One of the life-threatening symptoms that appears in narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is the sudden weakening of muscle tone that accompanies a sleep attack. A cataplectic attack may cause someone to physically fall over during a narcoleptic incident."
"Cataplexy often happens during high emotional states, such as excitement. As with other sleep disorders, changes in lifestyle can improve the course of narcolepsy. Introducing short daily naps can be helpful, as can general good sleep habits ."
Drugs such as amphetamines  can be used in the daytime to stimulate activity in the CNS and can be prescribed to treat severe cases of narcolepsy. Some antidepressant drugs can be used to treat cataplexy. The exact cause of narcolepsy has not yet been identified.
"However, there are many clues that point to a dysregulation of the signaling molecule orexin produced by cells in the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons die off in people with narcolepsy, but the cause of why the neurons die is unknown. Also, having a genetic predisposition to narcolepsy does not guarantee that a person will experience the symptoms, indicating that there is some combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to narcolepsy."
"While many cases of sleeplessness last a day or two, and some cases are clinically significant and treatable with behavioral changes, a very small fraction of cases of insomnia are incurable and deadly. In people with fatal familial insomnia , they experience severe insomnia. Some patients stay awake for up to six months at a time."
"As a result of either the disease or the sleep deprivation, they experience altered mood states, hallucinations, dementia, and eventually death, usually within two years after a diagnosis is made. The cause of FFI is unknown. There is a strong genetic component associated with it, as it appears frequently within certain family trees."
"But, there have also been a few cases of sporadic FFI, people with no apparent family members with the disease. One observation in common among people with FFI is significant damage to the thalamus, as a result of misshapen proteins called prions, a similar disease-causing agent that is responsible for mad cow disease. One very rare sleep disorder called REM sleep behavior disorder  can cause people to carry out complex, highly coordinated motor actions while they are sleeping, sometimes acting out their dreams as if they were reality."
"People with RBD are at risk of injuring themselves or others. Their sleep actions may be in response to a violent nightmare, causing them to jump out of bed, kick or punch the air, run through the house, or throw things. One of the most shocking instances of parasomnia-induced sleepwalking was the 1987 case of Kenneth James Parks, a Canadian man who, in his sleep, drove 23 km to the house of his in-laws and stabbed both of them with a kitchen knife."
"After his arrest, scientists discovered that his brain activity was highly abnormal during sleep. As a result of the medical examination, the Supreme Court of Canada acquitted him of murder in 1992. Almost every living organism that we know of on Earth exhibits some sort of cyclic pattern of activity that closely matches the rising and setting of the sun."
"Our sleep and wake cycles are associated with the day/night cycle. Previously, we discussed the retinal ganglion cells that transmit signals from the rods and cones of the retina into the brain for processing within the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex. A separate population of retinal ganglion cells do not process signals from the rods and cones, but rather serve as photoreceptors and are directly sensitive to light, communicating whether or not it is daytime."
"These cells send their axonal projections separately from the optic nerve that sends most visual information. Rather, they project through a pathway called the retinohypothalamic tract, synapsing on a clump of cells in the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus . In turn, these cells of the SCN have projections to a gland in the brain called the pineal gland, so named for its pinecone-like shape."
"The pineal gland converts the amino acid tryptophan into melatonin, an endogenous hormone, which is then secreted into the bloodstream. Melatonin helps the brain regulate the sleep-wake cycle with increased melatonin levels helping to signal the body to prepare for sleep. The production of melatonin is heavily dependent on exposure to sunlight."
"In the daytime, the SCN tonically inhibits activity of the pineal gland, resulting in low production of melatonin. But when daylight starts to decrease, the retinohypothalamic tract sends a weaker excitatory signal onto the SCN, which allows increased pineal gland activity. Light exposure is the main environmental influence that decreases melatonin levels."
"Not all wavelengths of light are equally potent at dampening melatonin production. The shorter wavelengths of light, down in the violet-blue range, are much more efficient at activating the retinohypothalamic tract compared to longer, yellow-red wavelengths. Increased retinohypothalamic tract activation leads to decreased melatonin production, which can delay the onset of sleep."
"Fluorescent or LED lighting and digital devices, such as computer screens and cell phone screens, use blue wavelengths of light. Therefore, the best advice to optimize your sleep habits is to eliminate exposure to all digital devices about one hour before your intended bedtime. The discovery of 24-hour patterns of behaviors began in 1729 with the French scientist Jean-Jacque d’Ortous de Mairan, who documented the movement of the Mimosa pudica plant."
"This unique organism was chosen since the plant exhibits heliotropism, light-seeking movements. In particular, this plant opened up the leaves in the daytime to capture sunlight, then closed at night, minimizing predation. When the plants were put into a dark room with no exposure to sunlight, to his surprise they still opened and closed their leaves in time with the clock."
"Mairan concluded that the plant did not change its behavior in response to light, but rather in response to some internal 24-hour clock. His work laid the foundations for future chronobiologists, scientists who study day-night dependent periodic phenomena in living beings. Any behavior or physiological measure that intrinsically cycles on a 24-hour pattern is said to be a circadian rhythm."
"The word circadian comes from the Latin words ‘circa’ meaning “around”, and ‘diem’ meaning “day”. Compare this with an ultradian rhythm, any cycle that is faster than 24 hours, such as the cycling between deep sleep and REM sleep every 90 minutes. Alternatively, compare with infradian rhythms, patterns that are longer than 24 hours, like the 4-week-long human menstrual cycle."
"Although we mostly think of the circadian rhythm in the context of sleep and wake, many other physiological measures fluctuate reliably throughout the day. Body temperature dips late in the evening, putting the body into a low-energy state that helps promote sleep. Withdrawal reflexes peak around midnight, hunger-driving hormone production rises before lunch and dinner, attention is usually highest in the morning—all manner of behaviors that rise and fall depending on the time of day can be said to be a part of a circadian rhythm."
"Luckily, a person’s circadian rhythm is not permanent. Anyone who has traveled overseas to a different time zone for more than a few days has experienced that uncomfortable sensation called jet lag, where a person experiences psychological symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and mood swings, and physical symptoms like daytime fatigue, insomnia, and gastrointestinal distress . Jet lag happens when there’s a mismatch between the internal environment and the signals that the brain receives from the outside world."
"If you flew east from Chicago to Cairo, for example, your circadian clock will be off by 7 hours. When your internal “Chicago” clock is telling you to start getting sleepy around 11 PM, the sun will be rising in Cairo, as the locals are starting to wake up. You may be eating when you’re not hungry or laying down in bed when you’re not sleepy, and this mismatch contributes to jet lag."
"However, with a few days of adjustment, you will be able to overcome jet lag. You will start sleeping as the sun sets, you will get hungry at the same time as the Egyptians, and your physiological measures will start to align with your time zone. This adjustment is only possible because our circadian rhythms are entrainable, meaning they are able to change and fit the surroundings."
"Our circadian rhythms entrain in response to zeitgebers, the German word for “time givers”: environmental cues, such as increased light exposure when the sun comes up, or social cues, such as increased sensory input from heightened activity of the people around you. A rise in the neurohormone melatonin is an important signal that contributes to helping the brain entrain, which is why taking a melatonin supplement late at night when in a new time zone may help someone get over jet lag more quickly. If sunlight is a trigger that helps a person entrain their circadian rhythm to new environments, what would happen if a person is completely isolated from sunlight?"
"In other words, what does a free-running circadian rhythm look like? One of the early documented case studies addressing this curiosity was conducted by a French cave explorer named Michel Siffre. In 1972, Siffre  spent six months deep in a Texan cave to evaluate what would happen to a person completely isolated from zeitgebers."
"At the end of the experiment, he found his circadian cycle was much longer than 24 hours, and very unpredictable—some of his so-called days would consist of being awake for 36 hours and asleep for 12. A more rigorous scientific study, conducted in a group of people living in an underground bunker with unchanging lighting conditions for several days estimates the typical free-running circadian cycle to be close to 26 hours. In other words, a person absent from external cues begin to fall asleep and awaken 2 hours later each day."
"Free-running circadian disruption is a potential issue for scientists aboard the International Space Station, who experience about 16 sunsets and sunrises per day, since the orbiting space vessel completes one trip around the earth every 90 minutes. In order to minimize the negative effects of jet lag on the researchers aboard, NASA has the inside of the vessel set to an artificial 24-hour cycle. Bright blue LEDs illuminate the cockpit in the “daytime,” while dim, red-shifted wavelengths are used in the evening to induce sleepiness."
"At the airport, you can observe people experiencing a wide range of emotions: Sadness at seeing family members off, fear and anxiety for those about to fly for the first time, love when a long-distance relationship is reunited, and anger over unpredictable cancellations. Emotions are complex neurophysiological states that contribute to an internal feeling and guide behavior. Some emotions are pleasant , some are negative , and some are a mix of both ."
"Some are short-lasting  while others may persist over years . However, beyond this statement, it becomes very difficult to put a clear-cut definition on “emotion”. The difficulty with defining emotion arises because of the fluid nature of emotions: they exist on a spectrum, multiple emotions are experienced simultaneously, each emotion is perceived by different people in unique ways, and everyone has a slightly different interpretation and understanding of an emotion."
"The field of affective neuroscience seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie emotion. The field has expanded with the help of functional imaging methods like EEG and fMRI, where changes in brain activity can be measured and quantified as a person experiences different emotion-provoking stimuli. Affective neuroscientists work to develop biology supported therapies for disorders such as depression, PTSD, and addiction, which are dysregulations of the emotions of sadness, fear, and desire, respectively."
"Although best known for his theory on evolution, naturalist Charles Darwin published prolifically about other topics in biology, ranging from botany, coral reefs, and even a treatise on psychology. In this 1872 text, called The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin suggested that similar emotional responding is found across different cultures, and to some extent, even in nonhumans. In his view, the main purpose of emotive expression is to communicate survival cues between individuals: a relaxed expression conveys safety, while a fearful expression promotes alertness, since danger may be nearby."
"Darwin also suggested that we gain survival information from non-human behaviors, for example, a hissing snake or a snarling lion is an immediate threat that should cause fear or other avoidance behaviors. Moving forward into more modern times, the American psychologist Paul Ekman expanded on Darwin’s theory, distilling down the range of human emotions to belonging in one of seven basic categories of emotions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. If the purpose of emotion was to communicate pro-survival cues, then Ekman theorized that all humans, regardless of culture, would use similar facial expressions."
"To test this hypothesis, Ekman visited a remote village in Papua New Guinea, where he studied a population that is isolated from any other known cultures. As predicted, these people made the same facial responses in reaction to various emotional circumstances. In 1972, Ekman published his theory of universal facial expressions."
"Part of Ekman’s research led their team to develop a series of photographs of actors portraying six major emotions. This Ekman 60 faces  test has since been used to assess facial emotions with fascinating results: People with major depressive disorder or borderline personality disorder have a lessened ability to detect happiness in others, seeing emotional faces results in a similar emotion in the viewer, and people with dementia or Parkinson’s disease identify emotions as being less intense. Ekman’s research led them to develop the Facial Action Coding System , a system that uses facial anatomy to differentiate the features that are characteristic of different expressions."
"For example, a feature of a happy face is the flexing of the zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi muscles, which produces an upward turn of the corners of the mouth and a rising of the cheeks. Other facial features, such as head movement, eye movement, and larger physical movements are also scored, and are also used to help identify emotions. The FACS can be used to formally describe why some smiles appear as genuine  while others look fake or forced ."
"One of the older theories about the origin of emotion is based on the most common sense interpretation of cause and effect. For example, imagine some noticeable emotional stimulus, such as encountering a hungry lion on the sidewalk. The logical cause and effect explanation suggests that seeing the lion prompts the emotion of fear, which then causes the sympathetic nervous system “fight-or-flight” response ."
"In the 1880s, psychologist William James and physician Carl Lange independently developed a new theory about the origin of emotion. According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, and contrary to a common sense understanding of the origin of emotion, the body’s physiological changes precede the onset of an emotional response. For example, imagine encountering that same hungry lion on the sidewalk."
"The James-Lange theory tells us that the perception of the threat of being eaten causes the sympathetic nervous system response, and that these physiological changes trigger the onset of fear. Soon after, in the 1920s and 1930s, two physiologists named Walter Cannon and his doctoral student Philip Bard criticized the James Lange theory. In one experiment, they surgically removed the entire sympathetic nervous system from cats, destroying the nerves that regulate vascular dilation, the activity of liver enzymes, and the reaction that causes the hair standing on end."
"These cats were then put before a threatening aggressor. If the James-Lange theory was true, then the physiological changes should precede the emotive response. However, the cats exhibited the fear / aggression response  even without an intact sympathetic nervous system."
"Relatedly, patients with spinal cord injuries have a similar lack of autonomic inputs to the brain, but their capacity for emotional responding is still intact. In a second criticism, Cannon and Bard proposed that the physiological changes seen in sympathetic nervous system activity may arise for a variety of reasons, not always for emotionally salient reasons. For example, intense exercise causes strong cardiorespiratory changes; however, we do not necessarily feel a strong emotional state after this physiological perturbation."
"Likewise, exogenous administration of epinephrine, onset of fever, or being in cold temperatures may also trigger some physiological changes without causing a strong emotional response. Based on their evidence opposing the James-Lange theory, Cannon and Bard developed an alternative explanation for the origin of emotions. According to the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion, the perception of an emotionally charged stimulus prompts simultaneous but independent activation of both the autonomic nervous system and the emotional response."
"The Cannon-Bard theory also draws attention to the neuroanatomical structures that trigger the autonomic and emotional responses, with a particular focus on diencephalon structures such as hypothalamus and thalamus. Just years later, in 1937, American neuroanatomist James Papez  ascribed emotional behavior to a particular series of brain structures. These structures, collectively called the Papez circuit, consist of the hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, hippocampus, and more."
"The model that Papez developed started with a stimulus that activates the thalamus, which in turn activates a loop of activity between the hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus and cortex to produce both a physiological response and emotional feelings. Papez observed unusual aggression among animals with injury to these structures, suggesting that emotional responding is distributed across many areas, rather than localized. Emotions are one of the most holistic functions of the brain, incorporating neural circuitry from across several different structures, ranging from the phylogenetically older to the most advanced frontal cortical areas."
"The structures of the Papez circuit are not a comprehensive list of brain structures involved in emotional processing but offer a good starting place for describing the anatomy of emotion. A limbic structure called the amygdala contributes heavily to processing the valence of emotional experiences. Roughly the shape and size of an almond, the amygdala is part of the temporal lobe."
"Generally, the amygdala is subdivided into several nuclei, including the basolateral amygdala, central nucleus, and cortical nucleus. As a temporal lobe structure, the amygdala is strongly implicated in emotional memory formation. Emotional memories can be either positive valence  or negative valence ."
"Of the forms of declarative memory, autobiographical memories more often have emotional content compared to semantic memories. Amygdala lesions have been used as a last resort treatment for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy or psychiatric conditions with pathological and dangerous aggressiveness. These psychosurgery strategies have been variably successful, but they often have high complication rates and upwards of a 4% mortality rate."
"These treatments are rarely used today. One of the major output signaling pathways of the amygdala is the hypothalamus, found at the base of the brain. The hypothalamus is often seen as the neural structure that initiates endocrine responses in the rest of the body, such as hormone production."
"Several different behaviors, ranging from homeostasis, hunger, and circadian regulation are modulated by hypothalamic signals. Downstream from the hypothalamus is the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine organ that protrudes from the base of the brain. It is strongly involved in the production and release of neurohormones, signaling molecules produced by nerve cells that travel throughout the bloodstream to influence the activity of several organs throughout the entire body."
"Recall that the pituitary gland is subdivided into two regions with distinct anatomical and functional differences. Hypothalamic magnocelluar neurons produce the neurohormones oxytocin and vasopressin. The axons of these neurons project to the posterior pituitary gland, which then releases these hormones into the bloodstream."
"Oxytocin plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of prosocial behaviors, acts such as trust, compassion, and empathy—all actions that enhance interpersonal relationships. Interestingly, while oxytocin generally strengthens the social bonds between people, it promotes antisocial behaviors against those not perceived to be within one’s own social group. Disorders of the oxytocin system are believed to contribute to autism spectrum disorder and psychopathy, two complex conditions characterized partly by social impairment."
"Some studies have examined the therapeutic use of nasal oxytocin for a variety of psychiatric conditions, but the studies have been unable to demonstrate strong clinical effects despite success in nonhuman animal models. The insula  is the lobe of the cortex buried deep within the lateral fissure. Although not visible from a side view, the insula is often considered to be the fifth lobe of the telencephalon."
"Early studies by Wilder Penfield where he directly stimulated the brain during open brain surgery led researchers to suggest that the insula contributes to interoception, detecting the internal state of the body and conveying that information for processing. In functional imaging studies, the insula is involved in the recall or many different emotional stimuli, especially those emotions that have a sensory component. Notably, the insula is strongly implicated in the emotion disgust."
"For example, a patient is placed in an fMRI scanner while breathing through a mask, which allows the experimenters to change the smells that are perceived. Patients are then given pleasant smells , a neutral smell, or unpleasant smells . There is increased activity of the anterior insula in response to the unpleasant smells but not the pleasant smells."
"The insula also responds to social cues related to disgust as well. When a patient in an fMRI sees a video of a person smelling something unpleasant and reacting with a “repulsed” face , their anterior insula likewise increases in activity just as if they had smelled it themselves. In addition to sensory stimuli, feelings of social repugnance  or moral disgust  also increase insula activity."
"Atypical insula activity is implicated in behavioral disorders. For example, insensitivity to disgust can lead to squalor-dwelling conditions , which puts those people at heightened health risks due to regular exposure to unsanitary conditions. Substance use disorders, PTSD, and suicide attempts have all been associated with atypical insula activity."
"Nearly everyone has experienced the prototypical fear response: Imagine reading a book when you see a spider skittering along the wall. Suddenly, you’ll feel your heart racing, your breathing increase, dryness of your mouth, and your palms sweating. You probably won’t notice the dilation of your pupils or the change in liver activity and digestion."
"This sympathetic nervous system activity is downstream of being presented with a fearful stimulus. But upon closer inspection, it was no spider at all—just an errant piece of brown fuzz picked up by a draft. Within minutes, your body’s physiology returns back to normal."
"This anecdote points out a few important features about the fear response. First, the onset of the fear response is quick, and so is the dissipation of the fear. Second, it is triggered by exposure to a perceived threat, regardless of whether the stimulus is a genuine threat or not ."
"Third, the fear response is greatly modified by knowledge and experience—an entomologist would recognize that the spider is a harmless house spider and would, instead of fear, display curiosity, interest, boredom, or other emotions. On the other hand, someone who has been bitten by a dangerous spider and sent to the hospital when younger would have a much stronger physiological response. Fear is likely the most evolutionarily ancient emotion, and is highly protective."
"When encountering a hungry mountain lion, faces displaying the traits of fear  would signal to others nearby that a threat is nearby, which helps initiate heightened alertness and the appropriate fight-or-flight response. In 1939, two researchers named Heinrich Klüver and Paul Bucy described a unique set of emotional deficits in monkeys with bilateral temporal lobe removal, including removal of the, further providing evidence of the neuroanatomy of emotion. Most notably, the monkeys failed to display fear, including their facial expressions and vocalizations even in the face of life-threatening stimuli such as a large snake."
"Further, they also had decreased anger or aggression. They also display visual agnosia , psychic blindness, hypersexuality, and hyperorality . Collectively, these sets of symptoms are called Klüver-Bucy syndrome."
"Although it is primarily an experimental manipulation observed in monkeys, some human patients may develop the condition, such in after brain surgery, stroke, viral encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, and many others. In addition to the symptoms described in Klüver-Bucy Syndrome, humans also display “flattened” emotions. The lesioning of the amygdala clearly results in decreased expression of fear."
"Stimulation of the amygdala, however, causes in increase in anxious, fearful, and aggressive responses in humans and other animals, such as piloerection in cats. In fact, amygdala activity is increased when shown images of fearful faces, but not neutral or happy faces when measured with fMRI. Patient SM is a notable case study of a person who does not experience the fear response."
"Born with an extremely rare genetic condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease, Patient SM progressively developed calcification in her amygdala bilaterally, causing destruction and cell death. Like other people with Urbach-Wiethe disease, she had no severe significant cognitive deficits, except for the inability to experience fear. In one test, she was shown a variety of emotionally charged videos, then asked to rate the intensity of each clip with respect to different emotions."
"SM found clips from America’s Funniest Home Videos to be just as funny as the control patients, and she found the clips of disgusting toilets to be just as repulsive. But, when presented with clips depicting ghost hauntings or suspenseful serial killers on the loose, SM rated these stimuli as being non fearful. Other studies challenged Patient SM with more concrete threats."
"Researchers brought SM to a pet store, where she asked to handle the snakes. She was stopped by an employee before she put her hand into a tarantula cage out of curiosity. The researchers also took her to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium haunted house, where she bravely led a group of strangers through the house populated by actors dressed as monsters and ghosts."
"Although she did not display any fearful behaviors, such as hesitation to walk through the darkened corridors, patient SM reported the sensation of exhilaration and enthusiasm, akin to riding a roller coaster. She also was asked to recall some of her past real-life, fear-provoking experiences, such as when she was attacked in a domestic violence incident or was held up by a stranger at knife point in a public park. In none of these cases did she ever report feeling fear, although she was upset and angered at the situation."
"The destruction of her amygdala seemed to make her resilient against PTSD: the day after being threatened with a knife to her throat, she walked past the very same park bench. Scientists have long realized there are at least two distinct types of fear:  Innate fear in which subjects avoid certain stimuli such as snakes or spiders even though they may never have seen them before Learned fear in which a stimulus or situation causes arousal or anxiety because it has been associated with a painful or negative experience in the past There are two important protocols used to examine learned fear: fear conditioning and conditioned defeat. One of the best studied laboratory models of fear comes from the work of Joseph LeDoux who studied the brain circuit that mediates learned or conditioned fear in laboratory rats."
"In these studies, LeDoux used a classical conditioning procedure to induce what he called “conditioned fear”. In classical conditioning , a neutral stimulus that normally would not cause any physiological response  is paired with a meaningful stimulus  that elicits a behavioral response . Eventually, the behavior  occurs in response to the conditioned stimulus  alone."
"Instead of pairing the conditioned stimulus with a positive unconditioned stimulus like food, LeDoux paired the conditioned stimulus with an electrical shock. After pairing the shock to the stimulus multiple times, the animals responded to the conditioned stimulus alone  in the same way they did to the electrical shock alone. This is referred to as the conditioned emotional response."
"In this model the experimental subject  is placed in the home cage of a larger, resident animal. This typically results in aggressive behaviors displayed by the resident animal toward the experimental subject. The resident animal will usually win the encounter because it is larger and in its own territory."
"The experimental animals will show submissive and defensive posturing and does not attack or threaten its opponent. Experiencing this defeat has major long-lasting effects on the experimental subject. Following defeat, the animal rarely shows aggression even to non-aggressive animals placed in the subject’s home cage ."
"Because this paradigm has parallels with the earlier fear conditioning studies that paired an acoustical tone with electrical shock to the feet, it is often referred to as “conditioned defeat;” the experimental subject has been conditioned to respond to all other animals with submissive defensive postures. Fear and anger are two very closely related emotions. As with many other emotions, anger manifests in complex ways."
"The anger spectrum runs from low  to high , and from quick  to persistent . Anger can manifest behaviorally as aggression, though clearly in humans we can feel angry without showing signs of aggression. In animal models, however, we can only judge anger through their display of aggressive behaviors."
"Aggression is affected by circulating levels of androgens, as castration  can reduce aggressive behavior. As with fear, amygdala activation is also related to aggressive displays, as bilateral removal of the amygdala causes animals to be less aggressive and more docile. A type of psychosurgery, amygdalectomy , can cause a “taming” effect in humans, and is still performed today, though rarely."
"In addition to amygdala circuits, regions in the frontal cortex decrease activity during acts of aggression, suggesting that frontal circuits actively inhibit the limbic system, which drive our more “primitive” responses. Researchers in the 1920s performed a series of lesion experiments, systematically injuring different parts of the brain in cats. To their surprise, when the cortex of the cat was surgically separated from the rest of the nervous system, a procedure called the decorticate preparation, the cats would exhibit a hyper-aggressive response to stimuli."
"For example, an innocuous touch of the tail would trigger violent clawing, biting, and hissing, behaviors which were described as sham rage. The same sham rage behavior was observed following a decorticate preparation that also included the anterior hypothalamus. However, when the decorticate preparation included both the anterior and poster hypothalamus, sham rage was no longer observed."
"They concluded that rage  is normally under inhibitory control by the cortex. Altered frontal cortical action may therefore account for one reason why two different people would react to the same anger-provoking stimulus in different ways. In a separate set of experiments, cats had different areas of their hypothalamus electrically stimulated while being presented with a rat."
"These experiments indicated that stimulation of different areas of the hypothalamus elicits distinct displays of aggressive behavior. When the medial hypothalamus is electrically stimulated, the cat displays what is caused a “threat attack”. The threat attack includes threatening behaviors such as hissing, but the cat did not attack the rat."
"If the lateral hypothalamus was electrically stimulated, the cat displayed a “silent-biting attack”. In this case, the cats did not display exaggerated threatening behaviors, but rather the cat would quickly and viciously attack the rat’s neck. It is likely every reader of this chapter has experienced some form of stress, perhaps due to a big exam, a looming deadline, or an unplanned interaction with a spider."
"The physical reactions to stress, like increased heart rate and breathing, are a result of brain activation. Stress is often split into two categories: physical and psychological. Physical stress can be caused by trauma, illness, or injury."
"Blood loss, dehydration, and allergic reactions are examples of physical stressors. Psychological stress has an emotional and mental component. Fear, anxiety, and grief are examples of psychological stress."
"The neural circuits involved in responding to the different stressors are overlapping but separate. The body has two main systems for responding to stress: the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis. The autonomic nervous system response occurs very quickly because it is synaptic in nature and is responsible for the “fight or flight” response, which stimulates heart rate and breathing and inhibits digestion."
"The HPA axis is a hormonal response, so it is a slower response relative to the autonomic system. Its downstream effects also promote energy use. The hypothalamus plays a critical role in stress, activating both the autonomic and hormonal responses."
"The hypothalamus is a region right above the brainstem on either side of the 3rd ventricle. The hypothalamus manages hormone release in the body and maintains homeostasis; this small structure is critical for numerous functions including hunger and thirst, temperature control, regulation of blood composition, sleep, reproduction, and stress. Although the hypothalamus directly controls the body’s response to stress, it is influenced by activity in other regions of the brain."
"When information from the environment is processed, activity is seen in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These regions have direct and indirect connections to the hypothalamus. The prefrontal cortex plays an executive decision-making role, the hippocampus places events in context with previous memories, and the amygdala assesses a wide range of stimuli for their potential ability to cause harm and places an emotional value on them."
"The amygdala is located medially in the temporal lobe. The amygdala, which means “almond” in Latin, is responsible for the processing of emotions and consolidating emotional memories. It is especially active during fear learning and evaluates the salience, or importance, of a situation."
"For instance, when we look at frightened faces, our amygdala is more activated than when we see neutral faces. Conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all linked to amygdala dysfunction. The amygdala regulates the HPA axis by regulating the activity of the hypothalamus."
"Specifically, the basolateral amygdala receives sensory information that is related to fear and processes that information within the central nucleus of the amygdala, which then influences activity of the hypothalamus and the stress response. Just posterior to the amygdala lies the hippocampus. The hippocampus, which means “seahorse” due to the similarity between its shape and the animal, is important in the long-term consolidation of memories, spatial navigation, and associating contextual cues with events and memories."
"Activity within the hippocampus typically inhibits the HPA axis. When a stressor is encountered, the stressor inhibits the hippocampus, thus disinhibiting the HPA axis and allowing for a stress response. Stress has been demonstrated to damage the hippocampus in both monkeys and humans, causing a decrease in the size of the hippocampus."
"This damage may be due to increased glucocorticoid levels from higher than normal activation of the HPA axis. On a cellular level, increased glucocorticoid levels alter the structure of hippocampal neurons in rodents, decreasing dendritic arborizations. Finally, the prefrontal cortex, which is located in the front of the brain in the frontal lobe, contributes to higher level cognitive functions like planning, critical thinking, understanding the consequences of our behaviors, and is also associated with the inhibition of impulsive behaviors."
"The prefrontal cortex is one of the last brain regions to fully develop and may not be fully developed until an individual reaches their mid-twenties. Experts think this might explain why teens are more likely than adults to participate in risky behaviors. When presented with a stressor, our brain activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis, which initiates a hormonal response."
"The hypothalamus, which sits below the thalamus, integrates information from many regions of the central nervous system and plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. The hypothalamus regulates temperature, hunger, thirst, blood volume and pressure, sleep and wakefulness, reproductive functions, and stress and fear responses. The hypothalamic regulation of the body’s response to stress is managed via hormone release by the pituitary gland."
"The pituitary gland is located inferior to the hypothalamus. The pituitary is divided into two lobes, the anterior and the posterior pituitary. These regions are responsible for the release of different hormones and are controlled by the hypothalamus in different ways."
The stress response relies on anterior pituitary function. The hypothalamus contains two types of neurons that secrete hormones into the pituitary: parvocellular neurosecretory cells and magnocellular neurosecretory cells. Parvocellular cells are smaller than the magnocellular neurons .
"In the HPA axis, the parvocellular neurosecretory cells release a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone  into a specialized capillary system that lies between the hypothalamus and the pituitary called the hypophyseal portal circulation. When CRH reaches the anterior pituitary, it causes the endocrine cells of the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone  into the general circulation. The ACTH travels through the circulatory system and can act on the adrenal cortex, a gland located on top of the kidney."
"The adrenal cortex releases cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone, into the blood stream. Cortisol travels throughout the body and has many effects that prepare the body for either fleeing or fighting the stressor. Promotion of energy use  occurs through the release of glucose, the sugar the body uses for energy."
"Cortisol is a steroid hormone; steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol and are able to cross the phospholipid bilayer because they are lipid soluble. Glucocorticoid receptors are located in the cytoplasm of many cell types across the body. The receptors dimerize after cortisol binds, and the dimer moves to the nucleus where it can alter DNA transcription."
"Once the stress response has been initiated, and cortisol enters the circulation, cortisol itself is able to act on the hypothalamus and pituitary and inhibit production of CRH and ACTH. This is called a negative feedback loop; the active hormone  can shut off its own production. Negative feedback is possible because neurons in the hypothalamus and pituitary express glucocorticoid receptors that are activated by cortisol."
"One area of the brain that regulates the HPA axis is the hippocampus. Activity within the hippocampus normally acts to inhibit activity of the HPA axis. Stressors in the environment inhibit activity of the hippocampus, which in turn disinhibits the HPA axis and allows for cortisol levels to increase."
"The hippocampus also expresses glucocorticoid receptors that bind to circulating cortisol and act to increase hippocampal activity. This in turn increase inhibition of the HPA axis, another example of negative feedback control within the circuit. While this cortisol response to stress is particularly important in certain situations, like moments of danger, chronic stress is an unhealthy scenario which can put people at risk for heart disease and other illnesses."
"Chronic stress can cause structural and functional changes, like cell death or alterations in the dendritic arbor, within the cortical regions that play a role in control of the HPA axis and the hippocampus due to long-lasting exposure to cortisol. The brain can be thought of as a well-oiled machine made up of hundreds of billions of moving parts, all cooperating in tandem for healthy behavior and function. There is redundancy in the way these parts are organized, allowing for occasional mishaps without any significant loss of function."
"But when these parts interact in unusual or atypical ways, a person may develop some psychiatric disorder. The conditions described in the next three chapters likely involve dysregulations in molecules, cells, or circuits, and are therefore complex. As far as we know, the likelihood of developing these conditions is not exclusively determined by either genes or influence from the environment."
"Instead, there is probably some influence from both. That is to say, none of these conditions are 100% penetrant; none of them are dictated exclusively by genetics. Having two parents or an identical twin with the condition may indicate an elevated baseline risk over the population at large, but it is not a guarantee that the disease will manifest."
"Environmental triggers and other exposures may lead to a sudden onset of the condition; on the other hand, certain factors in the environment may be protective against these diseases. One of the major challenges with understanding these brain diseases is related to the difficulty of making an accurate diagnosis—as almost everything in biology exists on a spectrum, so do these brain disorders. The symptoms of these disorders frequently overlap, adding another layer of complexity."
"To help establish a diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association  has put together a series of criteria for psychiatrists to diagnose these complex conditions. Recall our previous discussion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , used for compiling symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Many of the treatments we currently have for neuropsychiatric disorders aren’t always effective."
"Our ability to treat these conditions depends on our understanding of the disease. The better we understand the causes of these conditions, the wider variety of new therapies we can test. Therapeutic strategies for these conditions are often first tested using cells and non-human animal models, but these have shortcomings."
"Most of the time, animal models of disease incompletely mimic the symptoms of the disease. Unfortunately, we don’t have any animal models that reproduce the symptoms of the most complex human conditions—it is almost impossible to create a mouse model of dissociative identity disorder or dyslexia, and even if we could, scientists would struggle to quantify the behaviors that we use as diagnostic criteria, which are too subtle to be observed or quantified in non-humans. And for the animal models that we do have, they are often imperfect or incomplete, modeling only some of the deficits seen in humans."
"Furthermore, most human diseases have many symptoms, and only a few can be assessed with behavioral tests. We can only study disorders of the brain that have a clearly and easily quantifiable behavioral component. Anxiety is something that everyone has experienced at many points in their life."
"An anxious person may experience cardiovascular symptoms such as elevation of blood pressure and heart rate, shortness of breath, profuse sweating, and a state of panic. In many ways, the anxiety response is similar to the fight-or-flight response observed during sympathetic nervous system activity. However, a clinical diagnosis of anxiety is different from the passing anxiety that we all experience."
"Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, which is an adaptive response to an external threat or stressor. Anxiety disorders can be very common, and lifetime prevalence estimates suggest 29% of people could develop clinically significant anxiety over their life span. There are various anxiety disorders."
"Some are described below. Generalized anxiety disorder . People with GAD experience a constant sensation of being overwhelmed, accompanied by fear and worry."
"Many times, this worry is not about a single concern, but rather a combination of issues all at once, such as financial issues, relationship issues, uncertainty of the future, and many others. GAD is much more severe and persists longer than the normal worries that affect everyone. In GAD, worry persists for several months and is uncontrollable."
"There are also associated cognitive symptoms, such as fatigue, irritability, difficulty with concentration, and changes in sleep patterns. Specific phobias. With specific phobias, a person develops the anxiety-related symptoms  in response to highly specific stimuli, such as snakes, enclosed spaces, deep ocean, or public speaking."
"The person with the phobia perceives the stimulus to be a great threat, even though it does not actually pose a genuine threat. Most people with specific phobias will go to great lengths to avoid exposure to their particular phobia trigger. These phobias are often influenced by social and cultural conditions."
"Developing a specific phobia has a lifetime prevalence of about 7%, but only a very small number of people with specific phobias ever seek treatment for their phobia. Like other forms of anxiety, there is a range of severity of these phobias. Panic disorder."
"A person with panic disorder experiences frequent panic attacks, characterized by sudden increases in heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sudden numbness or tingling  In panic disorder, these panic attacks may occur independently of external influences. Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia involves a fear of entrapment or of having no escape."
"Individuals with agoraphobia may avoid crowds of people, riding elevators or cars, and crossing bridges. Social phobia. Social phobia is similar to more specific phobias, however, with social phobia there is a specific fear of public speaking or being in social situations."
"Obsessive compulsive disorder . OCD is a common psychiatric condition affecting an estimated 3% of the population, characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts or the need to perform some ritualistic series of actions or motions. OCD exists on a spectrum, and in severe cases, can severely impair the quality of an individual’s life."
"Post-traumatic stress disorder . Anyone can be diagnosed with PTSD at any point in their lives. Some of the most common events that lead to a PTSD diagnosis include combat experience, physical, emotional, or sexual assault or abuse, accidents, and natural disasters."
"Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with PTSD. Genetic influence appears to account for approximately 30-40% of risk. The symptoms of PTSD are usually divided into three categories: Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Hyper-arousal."
"Re-experiencing symptoms arise when stimuli cause PTSD patients to relive their traumatic experience in flashbacks, frightening thoughts, or nightmares. Avoidance symptoms arise when PTSD patients feel lack of emotion, lose interest in activities they once enjoyed, or withdraw from family and friends. These symptoms may be a result of trying to avoid reminders or triggers of the traumatic event."
"Hyper-arousal symptoms appear as increased anxiety or feeling tense in safe environments. PTSD patients can be easily frightened, may have trouble sleeping, and may have frequent angry outbursts. The exact cause of anxiety is still unknown."
"One theory suggests that anxiety is a maladaptive evolutionary response to our modern living conditions. The argument is based on the observation that an anxiety response looks a lot like a mild version of the fight-or-flight, sympathetic nervous system response: both elicit cardiovascular and respiratory changes. For the majority of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, we benefited from the sympathetic nervous system as a reflex to improve the odds of survival in dangerous situations."
"However, our modern civilized living conditions over the past few centuries have been very tame in comparison to the risks that our earlier ancestors experienced. The relative ease of living has let the main function of the sympathetic nervous system fall into disuse. The theory argues that people experience GAD because a part of them encourages sustained activity in the sympathetic nervous system."
"Although thought-provoking, this theory can’t be tested experimentally and offers no explanation about a biological mechanism that can help to develop a therapy. There are various treatments for anxiety disorders. Psychotherapy utilizes a therapist that performs exposure therapy for the individual  to practice being put in a situation that would normally cause anxiety and a fearful response to learn that the situation is not actually dangerous."
This treatment has been demonstrated to be very effective but does take time and can be uncomfortable for the individual receiving the therapy. Deep brain stimulation is a medical intervention in which a surgeon implants permanently indwelling electrodes directly into brain tissue. These electrodes are controlled by an external battery pack that delivers preprogrammed stimulation protocols.
"Deep brain stimulation has been approved for treating obsessive compulsive disorder and is being tested as a potential treatment for a number of other disorders. Psychosurgery involves an operation that uses a stereotaxic frame to make very precise alterations to the brain by cutting connections between brain areas or by selectively lesioning brain areas with the goal of correcting abnormal activity within the brain. Psychosurgery is still performed today, but not very often."
"Anxiolytic Drugs. Pharmacologically, there are a wide variety of drugs that can be used to treat anxiety, broadly called anxiolytics. The first-line therapies are usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , the same class of compounds that are used in depression treatment."
"Other anxiolytics, such as the benzodiazepines alprazolam or clonazepam, act as positive allosteric modulators which increases the effect of the GABA system. Benzodiazepines are not always preferred since they may have abuse potential and can be addictive. Opioids and norepinephrine inhibitors can also decrease anxiety."
"When treating individuals for anxiety using drugs, the placebo effect is especially strong in those with anxiety disorders. A placebo is an inactive substance that is not made to serve as a treatment, such as a sugar pill. The placebo effect is a real response  that an individual has to receiving a placebo."
"Interestingly, the mechanisms underlying how the placebo effect works is still largely unknown, but is believed to be related to the mind-body relationship. SSRIs are the most common treatment for anxiety disorders. A SSRI inhibits reuptake of serotonin by blocking the serotonin transporter  located on the presynaptic cell, effectively increasing serotonin concentration within the synapse, and increasing the likelihood that serotonin will bind to postsynaptic serotonin receptors."
"If increasing serotonin at the synapse is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders, to many it logically follows that anxiety disorders are caused by decreased serotonin levels. However, the cause of anxiety disorders is not so clear cut. It is possible that SSRIs might be treating symptoms of the disorders rather than the actual underlying disorder."
"Alternatively, these drugs may be producing compensatory changes within the brain that ultimately cause them to be effective. There are nonhuman behavioral tests used to assess anxiety in rodents, such as the elevated plus maze. This maze is a raised platform, with four arms in the shape of a plus sign."
"Two of the arms have walls surrounding the sides, while the other two are open, exposed on all sides. The rodent is free to move between any of the arms as they choose. Standing in one of the open arms, where they can see the floor far below them, is an anxiety-provoking condition."
"Under normal circumstances, rodents choose to spend more time in the arms that are surrounded by walls. But if you give these animals an anti-anxiety drug, they increase the time spent in the open arms, indicating a decrease in the behavioral expression of anxiety. A related behavioral test is the open field test."
"The test apparatus consists of a large, flat area where the rodent can move around freely, and some method to track the animal—either an aerial view camera or a series of parallel invisible infrared beams that can locate the animal in the field. In the wild, rodents, as prey animals, prefer to spend more time close to the sides of the testing arena up against the wall, avoiding the wide-open space in the middle where their instinct warns them that they may be snatched up by some predator. However, if you give the rodent an anti-anxiety drug, they will spend more time venturing into the middle of the open field."
"Another non-human model of anxiety is the predator exposure paradigm. In this paradigm, an ethologically-relevant stimulus is presented to the rodent, such as one of their naturally occurring predators. In this paradigm, rodent anxiety presents itself as a freezing response, an autonomic nervous system activity spike, and a reduction in non-survival behaviors."
"Although the predator exposure paradigm has good predictive validity, they may struggle with poor face validity, since the anxiety measures also may appear as many of several other conditions, such as PTSD or stress. Affective disorders are highly prevalent. Affect indicates mood, or emotional state."
"Therefore, affective disorders are disorders of mood. We will cover two major mood disorders: major depression and bipolar disorder. Episodes of depression can occur throughout an individual’s life with or without an external cause and can last on the order of months or years."
"Depression is a highly prevalent condition with a lifetime risk of about 18%. Depression gets diagnosed more frequently in women than in men, affecting about 5% of women and 2. 5% of men."
"Even with treatment, there is a high rate of relapse: an estimated 80% of people with depression have more than one episode in their lifetime. The prevalence of depression is similar across both high-income and low-income countries, indicating that biological factors contribute significantly to the disease. Major Depression Disorder is also called unipolar depression to differentiate it from the depression that represents a phase seen in bipolar disorder."
"Clinical depression is often associated with another medical or psychiatric condition. For example, rates of depression are higher among people with terminal diagnoses, like cancer. In this case, we say that the two are comorbid."
"Additionally, a set of particularly challenging circumstances, like the death of a loved one, could trigger a depressive episode. Major Depression Disorder represents a severe health risk across all ages. About 18% of adolescents report at least one instance of non-suicidal self-injury, and the lifetime risk for suicide among people with Major Depression Disorder is estimated to be about 10%."
"The fundamental criteria that are used to diagnose people with Major Depression Disorder is a depressed mood/self-esteem, low energy, and anhedonia, the decrease in sensitivity to pleasure. Because of the decrease in pleasure, they have a lessened desire to engage in activities that once produced happiness, thus leading them to become withdrawn from their friends and family. Short-term changes in mood are completely normal and not clinical."
"The main diagnostic criteria for Major Depression Disorder is the severity and duration of the symptoms. When the depression begins to affect other aspects of life, including feelings of worthlessness, changes in sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, or suicidal ideation that persist daily for two weeks or longer, then a person may be diagnosed as clinically depressed. To diagnose Major Depression Disorder, a trained psychiatrist or psychologist would use a combination of interview with a self-report questionnaire such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  or the Beck Depression Index."
"Items that appear on these sorts of tests include: “Feels like life is not worth living”, “Experience frequent weeping”, “I blame myself all the time for my faults”, etc. To date, there is no biomarker for depression. The monoamine hypothesis of affective disorders postulates that there is decreased signaling within monoamine neurotransmitter systems and is based on observations in depressed patients."
"First, treatment with different pharmacological substances has indicated that the monoamines serotonin and/or norepinephrine are involved in affective disorders. The drug reserpine blocks the vesicular monoamine transporter that is responsible for the loading of monoamine neurotransmitters into vesicles prior to release at the synapse and causes severe depression in approximately 20% of people. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, drugs that inhibit the degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters  have been demonstrated to improve mood."
"Lastly, the drug imipramine that blocks both the serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter is effective at relieving depression. These pieces of evidence support that affective disorders are a consequence of decreased serotonin and/or norepinephrine signaling. Serotonin, specifically, has been a neurotransmitter of focus in depression since the 1950’s due to a number of observations in depressed patients."
"There are lower levels of serotonin metabolites, such as 5-H1AA in the cerebrospinal fluid and diets that are low in tryptophan  can cause a return of depressive symptoms. Lastly, a number of drugs that are effective at treating affective disorders act to increase serotonin signaling and/or availability. However, it is important to note that there is also evidence that opposes the theory that affective disorders are due to a deficit in serotonin signaling."
"Primarily, that the level of serotonin in the synapse is less important than how serotonin acts in the synapse. Plastic changes at the synapse, either presynaptically  or postsynaptically  affect how serotonin or serotonergic drugs act on the synapse. There is also pharmacological data that supports a specific role for norepinephrine in affective disorders."
"The drug desipramine specifically blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine at adrenergic synapses and has been demonstrated to be effective at treating depression in some individuals. Recall that norepinephrine and serotonin have different synthesis mechanisms, with serotonin synthesized from tryptophan and norepinephrine synthesized from tyrosine. The drug AMPT inhibits the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step of norepinephrine synthesis."
"For individuals that are successfully treated for depression with the adrenergic drug desipramine, the administration of AMPT results in worsening of depressive symptoms. However, when AMPT is administered to those on serotonergic drugs, it has no effect on depressive symptoms. This evidence indicates that there may be separate groups of individuals in which either serotonin or norepinephrine is the major neurotransmitter system affected in depression."
Diathesis is a predisposition for a disease. The diathesis-stress hypothesis of affective disorders is based on the observation that mood disorders have a tendency to be more common in families with common genetics. This leads to some individuals having a genetic predisposition for the development of mood disorders.
"Further, abuse and stress have both been demonstrated to be significant risk factors for the development of mood disorders and anxiety and depression are often comorbid. In the diathesis-stress hypothesis, the HPA axis  is where both genetic and environmental factors converge to ultimately cause mood disorders. Specifically, the HPA axis has been shown to be hyperactive in depressed individuals, with increased levels of corticotropin releasing factor , adrenocorticotropic hormone , and cortisol and an overall decrease in negative feedback control of the HPA axis."
"The anterior cingulate cortex is a structure that is the anterior most portion of the cingulate cortex just dorsal to the corpus callosum. It is part of the limbic system and typically functions in emotions and in maintaining attention in healthy individuals. Interestingly, the anterior cingulate cortex is interconnected with the HPA axis, the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus."
"When individuals are sad or depressed there is increased activity within the anterior cingulate cortex, and successful treatment of depression results in decreased activity of the anterior cingulate cortex. It is hypothesized that dysfunction within the anterior cingulate cortex to prefrontal cortex circuit underlies difficulty in concentrating on tasks during depressive bouts. There is currently no completely effective treatment for Major Depression Disorder that reliably works for everyone."
"The currently accepted strategies can be divided into behavioral treatments and chemical treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy  is a therapist-guided form of talk therapy that may help a person manage their depression. In CBT, a patient’s behavior, including their coping mechanisms, erroneous thoughts, and emotional responses, is analyzed through careful clinical examination and patient self-reflection."
"Then, the patient is taught mechanisms to counteract those maladaptive behaviors and replace them with adaptive behaviors. For example, a person undergoing CBT for Major Depressions Disorder might learn to identify the moments when they dwell on something negative in their lives, and then learn to tell themselves: “That thought does not function to make my day better. Let’s start the day by getting out of bed and see what happens next."
"” It should be known that CBT is not exclusively for the treatment of Major Depression Disorder; CBT can also be effective for anxiety, OCD, PTSD, insomnia, substance use disorders, behavioral addictions, and many others. A wide variety of drugs are used for the treatment of depression. The first-generation antidepressants were developed in the 1950s and 1960s."
"These drugs acted to increase the action of the monoamine neurotransmitters: primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Our body uses an enzyme called monoamine oxidase  which degrades these chemicals into inactive components that do not signal at receptors. These first generation antidepressants block the action of MAO; biochemically, we call them monoamine oxidase inhibitors ."
"In the presence of an MAOI, the neurotransmitter signal remains in the synapse longer, similar to how an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor increases acetylcholine signaling. Most of the MAOIs, while sometimes effective, have fallen out of fashion clinically because of the adverse side effects associated with their biochemical activity. Some of them interact dangerously with foods rich in tyramine , an amino acid that is degraded by MAO."
"Excess tyramine can activate the sympathetic nervous system, and body levels of tyramine can rise to dangerous levels in the presence of an MAOI, leading to adverse cardiovascular events like stroke. Many of the common MAOIs, like phenelzine and isocarboxazid, can be damaging to the liver. Some MAOIs also produce unwanted side effects, such as psychosis or nausea."
"A different class of antidepressant drugs called the tricyclic antidepressants , named for the shape of their chemical structure, was also developed around this time. They generally act as monoamine reuptake inhibitors, resulting in elevated neurotransmitter signaling. Unfortunately, these tricyclics may produce many severe side effects, such as seizures, tachycardia, and heart attacks, so prescriptions must be monitored closely."
"The tricyclics are still prescribed today for several other nervous system disorders, ranging from insomnia to neuropathic pain, but due to their potential cardiotoxicity, they are not often the first line of treatment in depression. Our current, most often prescribed class of compounds for Major Depression Disorder, called the third-generation antidepressants, are focused on boosting the signaling activity of serotonin. Instead of preventing degradation, like the MAOIs, these compounds block the reuptake of serotonin out of the synapse."
"These chemicals are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , of which fluoxetine  is one of the most well-known examples. While SSRIs can be effective at reversing the side effects of depression, they are not perfect drugs. One shortcoming is that a person needs to be on the drug for 2-4 weeks before they start to experience a clinically meaningful reversal of depressive symptoms."
"This finding is highly unusual since the pharmacological, molecular-level effects of SSRIs take place within hours after taking the medication. Similar to SSRIs, SNRIs  can also be used to treat depression. One of the unsavory side effects of SSRIs is serotonin syndrome, a set of somatic changes resulting from excessive serotonergic signaling."
"In mild cases, a person may have an elevated body temperature, excessive sweating, rapid heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. In more severe cases, a patient may have severe fevers or seizures. Serotonin syndrome can happen in the event of an SSRI overdose, or as a consequence of some interaction between an SSRI and other drugs like MAOIs, MDMA , amphetamines, or cocaine."
"Our newest treatment options for depression, recently approved by the FDA in March of 2019, is esketamine, a dissociative anesthetic typically used as a veterinary tranquilizer and a recreational club drug. Branded as Spravato, it can be administered rapidly via nasal spray. The strength of esketamine is the speed of its action."
"After taking a dose, the antidepressant effects of the substance can be observed within hours. The speed at which this drug takes effect, makes it ideal for treating severe cases of suicidal thoughts. One future therapy that is currently making significant medical advancements in curing depression is the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly psilocybin—a substance found in some species of wild mushrooms."
"As a potent serotonergic agonist, a single dose of psilocybin has been shown to decrease depression scores in various self-report studies with little to no adverse side effects. For severe or treatment-resistant depression, electroconvulsive therapy  is a treatment option. Introduced in 1938, the procedure has since been refined over the years  and is considered to be well-tolerated and highly effective."
"During the procedure, electrodes are placed on the head and electrical current is passed through the electrodes. The mechanism of action that accounts for the therapeutic effects of electroconvulsive therapy are not well-known. Side effects include aches, nausea, and memory loss."
"Deep brain stimulation that targets the cingulate cortex or the prefrontal cortex that may be overactive in depression, is ultimately aimed at decreasing activity. This treatment is only pursued when other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful. Behavioral neuroscientists have developed a variety of tests to assess the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in non-humans."
"They are roughly divided into two categories: despair-based tests and reward-based tests. One symptom of depression is that a person “gives up”, a behavior that can be modeled in a variety of rodent tests. One such example is in a tail suspension test."
"In this test, a rodent is held by the tail upside down. While it does not cause injury to the animal, they do experience discomfort, and will generally struggle to either free themselves or to get upright again. The sooner they stop struggling , the more despair they experience, or the more depressive they are."
"Giving a rodent an antidepressant like fluoxetine causes them to fight for a longer duration. A similar test to assess “giving up” is the forced swim test. Here, a rodent is put into a container with some water."
"While they are naturally buoyant and are not at risk of drowning, they do not like being wet and will try to swim so that they can climb out of the water-filled container. As in the tail suspension test, they are unable to escape their predicament, and will eventually become immobile. Giving them an antidepressant decreases time spent immobile."
"These tests seek to measure the severity of anhedonia, one of the main symptoms of depression. For example, a rodent may be presented with a two-bottle choice task, where they are put into a cage with two different bottles to drink from: one filled with standard water, and the other filled with a more desirable sugar-water solution. A depressed rodent will not drink from the sugar-water bottle as frequently as a healthy rat but give that rat an antidepressant, and they will prefer the sweet water."
"An intracranial self-stimulation paradigm can also be tested here in the context of depression. When an electrical stimulator is placed in a reward area of the brain and the rodent is trained to perform some operant task to receive activation of these areas, we find that depressed rodents do not activate these areas of their brain as much as rodents on antidepressants. A person with bipolar disorder  experiences phases of clinical depression as described in the previous chapter and, at other times, they experience mania, a state of exhilarating high energy."
"During this state, they may sleep very little, have difficulty concentrating, and experience pressure of speech: a perceived need to speak very rapidly to get their thoughts out. They might make poor financial or life decisions. Historically, BD has been called “manic depression."
"” The estimated prevalence of BD is around 2. 5%, but the disease is often misdiagnosed in the clinic as Major Depression Disorder. One reason this happens is that more people are aware of the symptoms of depression, and these symptoms are generally more easily observed."
"Mania is more difficult to identify, since in mild cases it may be hard to distinguish from a person just “being in a really good mood”. For a diagnosis of BD according to the DSM-V, a mood cycle has to last for a week or more. The word “bipolar” is often misused in pop culture."
"Frequent changes in mood from happy to sad does not characterize BD. In fact, for a person to be diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, they need to experience four mood transitions annually! BD is usually diagnosed in adolescence and early adulthood. As with depression, there are some genetic factors involved, since a family history of BD is a risk factor."
"Concordance rates for identical monozygotic twins are estimated to be between 35%-80%. But, environmental influences may be the precipitating factor in the onset of BD. BD is diagnosed into two categories, based roughly on the severity of symptoms."
"Bipolar 1 disorder is the more severe of the two conditions, with a clinical diagnosis made when a patient experiences depressive or manic events that cause significant social or occupational impairment, or hospitalization to prevent serious self-harm. A diagnosis of Bipolar 2 disorder is less severe, but the behavioral changes are still noticeable by friends and family. A related diagnosis is cyclothymia, where a person has alternating mood states that shift from depression to hypomania, a less severe state of mania."
"Like most other disorders, BD exists on a spectrum, and these labels only exist for simplicity. The main issue with BD therapy is bringing the patient to some “middle” state: an antidepressant may treat the depression phase, but could also swing the patient into mania. Similarly, a mania-controlling drug could initiate depression."
"Currently, our most reliable therapy for BD is lithium drugs. These compounds are described as mood stabilizers since they act to move the patient’s mood to the center, rather than being at either the high end of mood  or the low end . The way lithium acts to reverse the symptoms is still unknown, and it probably acts on multiple pharmacological targets."
"The main downside of this therapy is that lithium is very toxic. It has a very narrow therapeutic window: blood levels of lithium lower than 0. 6 mEq/L produce no effect, and anything above 1."
"5 mEq/L causes delirium, tremor, fatigue, and deadly side effects like seizures and coma. It is also harmful to the kidneys after long exposure. Therefore, a person taking lithium drugs regularly undergo therapeutic drug monitoring, a procedure by which the concentration of lithium is assayed."
"Therapeutic drug monitoring requires frequent visits to a hospital. Usually, patients get multiple blood draws in the first month when they start lithium treatment, decreasing to one test every 2 months, before decreasing to about four times a year. Bipolar disorder is very challenging to model in nonhumans."
"A genetically modified disruption of the circadian rhythm can induce mania-like symptoms, as can extending the length of daytime light exposure; oppositely, decreasing daily light exposure can induce depressive behaviors. Exposure to amphetamine can increase manic behaviors, while withdrawal from the drug can induce depression. Clearly, neither of these models for BD exhibit strong validity."
"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition affecting just under 1% of people. Schizophrenia affects men slightly more often than women and affects people of all races. There is a strong association between low socioeconomic status and the risk of developing schizophrenia, indicating that stresses such as neonatal nutritional deficiency or food insecurity may be risk factors."
"Other risk factors that contribute to increased schizophrenia risk include prenatal drug exposure, heavy drug use during early adolescence, and childhood adversity. A diagnosis is generally made while a person is in their late adolescent years through their thirties. During this phase of life, the brain is still undergoing subtle maturation processes, which may account for why a person is more vulnerable in these years."
"After this age, the risk of developing schizophrenia decreases significantly. Also, the later in life that schizophrenia symptoms appear, the better the health outcomes are. It is worth noting that people with schizophrenia have the neurotypical range of intelligence, with the occasional outliers: John Nash, the real-life Nobel prize-winning economist depicted in the movie “A Beautiful Mind”, was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1959."
"The symptoms of schizophrenia can be roughly classified into two categories: positive symptoms and negative symptoms. These phrases are used to describe whether there is an excess of some function, , or a deficit of a function, . The symptoms do not appear uniformly across patients, so not all patients develop every symptom."
"The most well-known positive symptom of schizophrenia is hallucinations, perceiving something that is not there . Usually, patients experience auditory hallucinations, but they more rarely have visual hallucinations. The voices that people hear may be consistent or can change over time."
"Interestingly, the nature of these hallucinations is influenced by society. In cultures with strong ancestor reverence, they may hear the voices of their grandparents, whereas people in religious cultures may hear the voices of deities. Relatedly, people with schizophrenia may experience a variety of delusions, untrue beliefs that cannot be changed despite overwhelming evidence."
"The delusions can come and go spontaneously. Delusions exist in many forms. A paranoid delusion is when a person believes that they are being spied on, maybe by the government or by aliens."
"A persecutory delusion is a persistent thought that the world is out to get them or to do them harm. Delusions of grandeur are when a person has a tremendously high sense of self esteem, believing that they are royalty or are the reincarnation of God. Other positive symptoms that can present in schizophrenia are a variety of motor disturbances."
"Basal ganglia and cerebellar structural deficits are found in schizophrenia, two brain structures involved in motor control, which may explain why deficits are observed. One motor difficulty is catatonia, where a person can hold their body in a highly unusual position for a prolonged period of time. They may also display stereotypy, a series of repetitive, purposeless behaviors, such as the persistent rocking of the body or self-caressing."
"The negative symptoms of schizophrenia may include deficits in expression. One common symptom is a flat affect, where a patient does not show or express emotion in situations where you would expect to see them. A related negative symptom is alogia, a decrease in the use of language."
"People with alogia often use vague language that is lacking in content or repetitive. Negative symptoms also include deficits in motivation or interest. Two closely-related negative symptoms include anhedonia, a loss of a sensation of pleasure and the inability to expect upcoming pleasure."
"Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia may also exhibit avolition, a decrease in goal-directed activity, which can cause a person to stop seeing their friends and cease displaying interest in social gatherings, leading to worsened interpersonal relationships. Negative symptoms may also manifest as a deficit of a patient’s cognitive abilities, particularly shortcomings in episodic memory. They may also present with difficulty in performing attention-related behavioral tasks."
"Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, with increased risk associated with having a first-degree relative that has the disease, however most individuals with schizophrenia do not have a family history. Many different genes have been identified in disease onset and progression. One example supporting the genetic component of schizophrenia are the Genain Quadruplets."
"They were a set of identical quadruplet sisters that were born in 1930. All four of the sisters developed schizophrenia by the age of 24. The sisters’ paternal grandmother may have had schizophrenia and it was known that they grew up in an abusive household, making it unclear if their development of schizophrenia stemmed from their environment, genetics, or a combination of the two."
"A number of structural abnormalities have been observed in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia. For one, the lateral ventricles are typically enlarged in those with schizophrenia than in those without schizophrenia. The increased size of the lateral ventricles could alter intracerebral pressure or compress the areas of the brain adjacent to the lateral ventricles."
"In addition, a decrease in cortical thickness has been observed as well as wider than typical sulci between the gyri. Problems of cell migration during development may also play a part in schizophrenia, leading to abnormal cellular densities and organization. There also seems to be cell loss and disorganized cell location within the prefrontal cortex."
"In a healthy person, dopamine is important for motor control and motivation, two behaviors that are changed in patients with schizophrenia. Dopamine receptors  are found throughout the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways. Therefore, scientists have suggested that increased dopamine signaling may be an underlying root cause in schizophrenia."
"In fact, psychotic episodes are triggered by activation of dopamine receptors and increased D1 receptor binding has been observed in the prefrontal cortex in those with schizophrenia. While the dopamine hypothesis is one of the earliest theories of schizophrenia, modern genetics studies have shown that polymorphisms in the dopamine D2 receptor are risk factors. One animal model for schizophrenia is based on the hypothesis that excess dopamine leads to the disorder."
"Introducing high doses of the drug amphetamine, which increases dopaminergic signaling, induces a temporary schizophrenic-like state in non-human animals. The hyperdopaminergic model of schizophrenia produces cognitive deficits with no changes in memory or other negative symptoms. Alternatively, administration of NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, like ketamine or PCP, is also used as a behavioral model of schizophrenia."
"Other non-human models of schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental models. In these models, a pregnant dam is exposed to the compound MAM, which causes the newborns to develop atypically and display behavioral deficits similar to schizophrenia. Inducing an unusually strong immune response in the pregnant mother can also cause atypical development in utero, which causes the animals to experience behavioral deficits after birth."
"The biggest limiting factor to developing an animal model is that many symptoms in human schizophrenia, like paranoid delusions or auditory hallucinations, are impossible to detect and quantify in nonhumans. The PCP model can cause changes in rodent social behaviors, but it is hard to tell if this model causes any of the positive symptoms that you might see in a patient with schizophrenia. Despite the limitations of these non-human models of schizophrenia, they have been helpful in testing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-schizophrenia drugs."
"The dopamine theory of schizophrenia has led to a few novel therapeutic strategies, especially in the context of the dopamine D2 receptor. Typical, or classical, antipsychotics such as thorazine or haloperidol are more effective treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and delusions in some patients. These drugs block D2 dopamine receptors  and decrease dopaminergic signaling, however they have many undesirable motor side effects such as tremors, decreased voluntary movement, tardive dyskinesias, and a shuffling gait named the ‘Thorazine shuffle’."
"The effectiveness of the antagonist is correlated with the ability of that drug to block the D2 receptor. Atypical, or nonclassical, antipsychotics such as Clozapine, antagonize a wider array of dopamine receptors in addition to some serotonin and norepinephrine receptors. These drugs more effectively treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also can treat the positive symptoms with less side effects compared to the typical antipsychotics."
"Unfortunately, pharmacological therapies are not always effective in humans. Around a third of patients discontinue their treatment regimen, and around a fifth of them report adverse side effects such as extrapyramidal motor symptoms, sedation, and weight gain. A potential new therapy is based on transcranial magnetic stimulation."
"In physics, there is a close relationship between electricity and magnetism. The movement of magnets can generate electric currents, and conversely, electricity can generate magnetic fields, a process called induction. A brain stimulation technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation  relies on induction to generate electrical currents through the skull."
The TMS machine itself is a handheld coil of wires in a loop. Passing electrical current through that loop produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field generated then induces an electrical current at some distance away from the coil.
"By placing the coil at the surface of the scalp, we can electrically activate small areas of brain tissue. For instance, using TMS above the motor cortex causes muscle contractions, and using TMS above the occipital lobe causes the perception of flashes of light. A single pulse of TMS delivered to the right motor cortex will produces electrical activity in the motor nerve of the left hand, causing it to twitch."
"In repetitive TMS  multiple pulses are delivered, which has been demonstrated to produce long-lasting effects that extend beyond the stimulation period. rTMS can be used to produce either inhibition in brain targets, through low frequency rTMS, or to produce excitation to the brain through high frequency rTMS. TMS is believed to have moderate benefits for several different psychiatric conditions, potentially making it a meaningful therapeutic intervention."
"Single pulse TMS can be used to evaluate damage from stroke, ALS, multiple sclerosis, and a number of motor disorders. It has also been approved for the treatment of migraines. rTMS delivered to the motor cortex may help alleviate chronic pain conditions, Parkinsonian symptoms, and improve contralateral motor function following stroke injury."
"Further, rTMS activation of prefrontal cortex can decrease anxiety, antidepressive symptoms, cigarette craving or consumption, and schizophrenia. Stimulation of other brain regions can be antiepileptic and may also minimize auditory hallucinations or tinnitus  In schizophrenia, some evidence suggests that targeted activation of the cortex can decrease the severity of auditory hallucinations. There may also be some mild improvements in the negative symptoms."
"The technique itself is completely noninvasive. TMS can be delivered simply with placement of the electric coil on the surface of the head. TMS may have some unexpected consequences, such as temporary headaches, localized pain, changes in hearing, and bizarre changes in somatosensation."
"The most severe side effect so far recorded is seizures, which can be very dangerous. Use of TMS is still highly experimental. As with fMRI, the magnetic fields generated by a TMS device can cause dangerous interactions with any magnetosensitive implants, such as deep brain stimulation devices, cochlear implants, or aneurysm clips."
"Think back to your favorite birthday party. Which of your friends were there? What did you do, where did you go, and did you have cake?"
"Did you get gifts? The ability to perform this task depends on our ability to create and recall memories. According to our current best understanding of the neuroscience of learning, the underlying biology of a memory mainly consists of subtle changes among synapses distributed across several brain areas."
"Our ability to learn new facts, recount the events of last week, or to perform new motor skills is the result of learning-induced neural plasticity. In our discussion of learning and memory, we will consider different aspects of learning and memory, starting from the behavioral level down to the molecular changes responsible for memory formation. First, it is important to distinguish between different types of memories."
"Declarative memories, also called explicit memories, are the pieces of information that can be consciously declared or stated explicitly. Declarative memories are thought of as a “knowing what”. Declarative memories can be further subdivided into semantic memory and episodic memory."
Semantic memories are pieces of factual information. Some examples include: 1. “Jupiter is the largest planet of our solar system.
” 2. “Rosalind Franklin discovered the doublehelix structure of a DNA molecule. ” 3.
"“The actor Keanu Reeves played the protagonist of the movie The Matrix. ”  An episodic memory, sometimes also called an autobiographical memory, is the recollection of a discrete moment in a person’s life. It can be thought of as “mental-time travel”—what was it like when."
"The following memories are examples of episodic memories: “When I got home, I put my wallet and phone on the table. ”, “I ordered pizza last night. ”, “In 2019, I went to see my favorite musicians perform live."
"”. Declarative memories can either be a short-term memory or a long-term memory, which are distinct from each other. The process of memory consolidation takes facts and events and converts them from short-term memory into a long-term memory, which is supported by structural and functional change within the neurons that hold the long-term memory."
"Nondeclarative memory encompasses all other types of memory outside of semantic and episodic memory including procedural memories, skeletal muscle memory, and emotional response memory. Procedural memories,  are unconscious memories, and can’t be explicitly stated. These can be thought of as “knowing how”."
"Some examples of procedural memories include, for example, performance of a series of motor actions without conscious thought such as an experienced musician playing a simple scale , or a priming effect , causes a dog to salivate, a naturally occurring behavior, called the unconditioned response . Dogs are not particularly interested in the sound of a bell: this neutral stimulus will produce a minor response, such as a head turn and attentional shift towards the origin of the sound, but not much more than that. However, when this stimulus is repeatedly paired with the presentation of food, dogs quickly learn to associate that the bell signals food."
"After multiple pairings, upon hearing the bell, a conditioned stimulus , the dogs begin to salivate, a conditioned response , independent of any food being presented. Associative learning can also be measured with instrumental conditioning where a rodent, for example, learns to associate a response with a meaningful stimulus. For example, a rodent will learn to press a lever for access to food."
"Separate from declarative or procedural memories, a different form of memory called working memory involves processes of storing information temporarily while simultaneously manipulating those pieces of information. This type of memory can be thought of as a “short-term memory on overdrive. ” For example, a test of working memory is the digit span test, where a person is given a series of numbers to remember, then they are asked to repeat the numbers in reverse order."
"After successfully completing this task, a different series of numbers, this time one digit longer, is presented to the patient until they first start making errors in recall. A related task is called the Corsi block tapping test, where an experimenter sets up several blocks on a table. The experimenter then taps a series of blocks in a specific order, then the subject is asked to tap on the blocks in reverse order."
"As with the digit-span test, the experimenter then makes the series of blocks longer until they make mistakes in the tapping. In the 1950’s, the scientist Karl Lashley was interested in finding a location in the brain where memories were stored. His experiments searched for the location within the cortex of what he called an “engram” or memory trace."
"He trained rats to run in a complex maze to reach a food reward, which took the animals time to learn. After the animals had learned how to successfully run the maze, Lashley would lesion different areas of the rat cortex and then test the rats in the maze again. He found that regardless of the location of the lesion, which was done at different areas of the cortex for each rat, that cortical lesions resulted in decreased ability to remember the location of the food reward and run the maze."
"Instead of finding a specific location where the memories were being stored, Lashley discovered that the size of the lesion corresponded to the amount of memory deficit in the animal, but that the location of the lesion did not have an effect, demonstrating that the engram was widely spread across the cortex. The main structures of the medial temporal lobes include the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex. Together, these structures are important in both consolidation and storage of declarative memories."
"The hippocampus, meaning “seahorse” in Greek, was named based on its morphology and resemblance to a seahorse. The hippocampus is located along the ventral and medial surface of the brain. The hippocampus is one of the critical structures of the limbic system, a series of subcortical brain structures that are involved in several different complex behaviors, such as emotions and memory."
"The limbic system is an evolutionarily ancient brain network. The hippocampus is involved in spatial memories, memories involved in navigation of our surroundings, and the creation of a mental map of our world. Spatial memories are developed when we enter a new building for the first time and we search for a new classroom."
"We also use our spatial memory whenever we are walking around campus, making our way from one building to another, thinking about the streets you’d need to cross or the buildings you can cut through. While the volume of the hippocampus is not a reliable indicator of the strength of a healthy person’s spatial memory, injury to the hippocampus causes deficits in spatial memory. One of the most influential case studies in the neuroscience of memory is the story of Patient HM."
"Since his death in 2008, we now know that Patient HM’s name was Henry Molaison. HM was born in 1926 in a small Connecticut town. In his childhood, HM began having severe seizures, possibly the result of a head injury."
"In his teenage years, he started having tonic-clonic seizures, the most severe form of seizures that produces a loss of consciousness and convulsions . In his early adulthood, he was having a tonic-clonic seizure monthly and several minor seizures daily, preventing him from working a normal job or living a normal life, despite taking a cocktail of anti-epileptic medications. Neurosurgeon William Scoville proposed a “frankly experimental operation” to treat HM."
"It was known that most epilepsy originates in patches of neurons of the medial temporal lobe, and HM’s epilepsy was typical in this respect. Scoville suggested to surgically resect, or remove, the medial temporal lobe. In 1953, Scoville removed about 8 cm of the medial temporal lobe bilaterally, including part of the amygdala, and notably the hippocampus, the seahorse-shaped structure of the brain."
"The surgery succeeded at its primary goal: HM’s seizures were less frequent and less severe. However, HM was left with a highly unusual and life-altering side effect: He was unable to create new declarative memories, a memory deficit called anterograde amnesia. For example, he could not remember what he had eaten for lunch just minutes after finishing the last bite."
"Despite being an avid fan of watching the news, HM couldn’t remember the names or the faces of different celebrities or public figures. It was as if he was permanently living in the present. However, despite his pervasive memory deficits, HM did not display any deficits in intelligence."
"His language and speech were unaffected, and word recall was excellent, as he loved completing crossword puzzles and often did so successfully late in life, with only the occasional spelling errors. He could learn to acquire new skills, such as keeping a pen still on a moving circular platform, or a tapping task . He was also capable of recalling things from his early childhood, such as geography facts he had learned in elementary school."
"The fact that HM’s medial temporal lobe surgery disrupted some types of memories  while others were still intact  inspired neuropsychiatrists to try to define the different forms of memory. Much of the research was led by Dr. Brenda Milner, who carried out several behavioral tests on HM to figure out what types of memories are dependent on the intact medial temporal lobe and which ones can function without the medial temporal lobe."
"Several tests concluded that HM had lost his ability to create new semantic memories. In one such study, HM was asked to determine if a word was made up or real. He was shown words with very old origins, such as “shepherd” or “butcher."
"” On these words, he performed as well as the control group. When he was shown words that are made up, such as “phlage” or “thweise”, he likewise performed as well as the controls. However, when shown words that were added into the dictionary after his 1953-surgery, such as “granola” or “jacuzzi,” he scored about 50% correct—consistent with guessing at random, as if he never acquired the knowledge that these words have a meaning."
"HM was also unable to create autobiographical memories. When asked to recall one of his birthday celebrations as an adult, he wouldn’t be able to give any significant details about the event. Instead, his answers were often vague and generic."
"One interesting observation was that HM’s memory about details from his childhood were still intact. The inability to recall memories from the past, in this case, from before HM´s surgery, is called retrograde amnesia. Patient HM’s retrograde amnesia was temporally graded, meaning that the farther back you examine, the more complete his memories were."
"Many of his memories for the two years before his surgery were completely lost, but memories from his youth and teenage years were intact as much as healthy individuals   From this observation, memory researchers concluded that the medial temporal lobe functions as short-term storage site for memories, but after some years, those memories get relocated to other brain areas outside of the medial temporal lobe. Currently, the scientific evidence suggests that memories are distributed across several networks of cortical and subcortical brain areas. While HM lost the ability to create new declarative memories, he was still able to maintain a different class of memories, called procedural memories ."
"The original test of procedural memory conducted by Dr. Brenda Milner was called the mirror tracing task. In this test, the patient is told to draw a third star in between the two stars as quickly as possible without making any mistakes."
"The challenge is that the tracing is to be done while watching their hand and the star in their reflection in a mirror. Because of these unusual circumstances, completing this task is difficult. But over multiple days of practice, people become better at this mirror tracing task, completing it faster with fewer errors."
"Improvement on this task indicates that a person is learning or gaining some memory about how to better perform the task. After practicing this mirror tracing task, HM was able to finish drawing the star about ten times faster than when he first began. He improved his performance within each day’s worth of training, and he also improved day-to-day."
"There is evidence that he maintained these skills up to one year later, despite not having regular training on this task. Surprisingly, each day Milner examined HM, she would need to reintroduce herself since he forgot who she was. She also had to re-explain what HM was supposed to do in the mirror tracing task."
"Hence, while HM was unable to form declarative memory about the experiment or the people involved, learning of the procedural memories and motor actions involved in this task remained intact. Based on the deficits seen in Patient HM and other experimental manipulations of the hippocampus, we conclude that the hippocampus is strongly implicated in the process of declarative memories and spatial navigation. Since some of HM’s memory functions were still intact, such as procedural memories and working memory, it is believed that these functions are independent of hippocampus function."
"To test spatial memory behaviorally in nonhuman animals, one test that is regularly used in rodents is called the Morris water maze. In this test, a shallow pool is filled with an opaque liquid, making it difficult to see through. Hidden somewhere in this pool is a clear plexiglass platform, and surrounding the pool are different environmental cues that can be seen from the surface of the water, such as different shapes or colors."
"The water is deep enough that when a rodent is put into the Morris water maze, they have to swim to stay afloat. The rodents swim around aimlessly until they find the platform, the time it takes for this to happen is recorded, and the trial ends. Over time, the animals learn that the platform is located near certain navigational cues, and on future trials, the animals spend more time near those cues, and the latency to find the platform decreases."
"When the hippocampus is surgically removed from rodents or inactivated, they perform poorly in the Morris water maze. Another non-human behavioral test used to assess the capacity for learning navigational cues is the radial arm maze. In this test, a rodent is placed on a circular platform."
"Extending from this platform are eight or more “arms”, at the end of each is a small dish. In one of the dishes is a morsel of food , while the other dishes contain nothing . The maze is designed so that the food cannot be seen from the end of each arm, so the animal must return to the starting platform before exploring another arm."
"The number of entries into a non-rewarded arms is counted as an error. Over time, the animals make fewer errors as they learn which arm is rewarded and which ones are not. Alzheimer’s disease model organisms perform poorly on this task."
"An individual memory is likely distributed widely across several different parts of the brain. However, there are a few special populations of neurons mainly in the medial temporal lobe that contribute to highly specific types of memories. Place cells are a special population of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus."
"These neurons increase their firing activity when the animal is in a particular location in an environment, indicating that they contribute strongly to location and navigational memory. There is no apparent topographical arrangement of these place cells, meaning that adjacent areas of an environment do not necessarily activate adjacent hippocampal place cells. The place cells, when firing at the right times, help the animal create a spatial map of their surroundings."
"Grid cells are located in the entorhinal cortex, the main input structure to the hippocampus. Closely related to the place cells described above, grid cells increase their firing properties periodically when an animal is at an intersection of a “grid” in a wide-open, previously-explored environment. The grid itself is roughly hexagonal, and spans the whole environment an animal is in."
"The overlap of multiple grids gives the animal an idea of the surroundings. The scientific description of grid cells earned three scientists, Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser, and John O’Keefe, a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2014. Concept cells are a series of cortical neurons in the temporal lobe that increase their firing exclusively in response to highly-specific stimuli, such as the idea of Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry, or the Tower of Pisa."
"These concept cells respond to much more than just pictures: for example, a Luke Skywalker neuron that responded to a picture of young Mark Hamill  will also respond to text that reads “LUKE SKYWALKER” and the sound of a person saying “Luke Skywalker”. Although this particular neuron probably won’t fire in response to pictures of athlete Manu Ginobili or actress Marilyn Monroe, the neuron might fire in response to pictures of Yoda or Darth Vader, indicating that the neuron may encode an even broader concept, such as “Star Wars characters” or “Jedi”, or is a part of a network that encodes concepts related to the Star Wars franchise. As part of the frontal lobe, the prefrontal cortex is involved in higher order decision making and personality."
"In the context of memory, neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex are important for short-term and working memory. A delayed-response task relies on prefrontal cortex activity. In this task, a monkey is shown a cue of food placed into a randomly selected compartment outside their cage."
A screen is then lowered and the compartments are covered for a standard period of time. The screen is then raised again and the monkey is tasked with correctly uncovering the compartment that contains the food. Animals with a lesion to the prefrontal cortex perform worse than animals with an intact prefrontal cortex in this task.
"Patients with injuries to their prefrontal cortex after stroke, tumors or aneurysm, performed worse on a variety of working memory tasks such as the digit span test. Additionally, people with frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degradation of the frontal lobe, often have difficulty with working memory. The prefrontal cortex also has strong projections with the hippocampus, and these circuits are likely also involved in the formation of hippocampal-dependent memories."
"The striatum, made up of the caudate nucleus and putamen, is important for habit or procedural memory and reward in learning. A T-maze is used to test procedural learning. In this task, a rodent is placed at the area of the maze that corresponds to the bottom of the T."
"The animal is trained to turn either left  or right  once they reach the cross of the T. If the animal completes the task successfully, they are rewarded with a treat. The ability of the animal to learn this task is dependent on activity within the striatum."
"Animals that have striatal lesions have impaired performance on the T-maze, but not on tasks that rely on other types of memory. In the late 1800s, around the time when Golgi and Ramon y Cajal were engaged in intense debate about the organization of the nervous system, many neuroscientists came to a strange observation: the weight of the brain increases dramatically over the first 10 years of life, but not much more after that. Even though we learn lots of new facts and make lots of new memories in adulthood, the brain itself doesn’t grow in size."
"So how is it possible to store new knowledge if the brain is not making many new neurons? Most likely, new pieces of information are held in the connections between cells, not just in the cells themselves. If our estimate of 150 trillion synapses per adult brain is correct, then it is possible that we could store all the knowledge and memories that we collect over our lifetime through some combination of activity across certain connections."
"The activity at the cellular level is believed to take place on at least three different levels enabling us to build, store, and retrieve memories. Encoding refers to the ability for brain circuits to store some piece of information. In real life, you are presented with countless stimuli simultaneously."
"Imagine walking down a busy street, and think of the number of different sights, smells, and tactile stimuli you experience. Storing memories is an energetically costly process, and we are limited in the fact that all of our sensory inputs cannot possibly get encoded. Instead, evolution has preferred to encode stimuli that are the most salient pieces of information, such as perceptual cues associated with predators."
"Alternatively, information that we pay strong attention to can get encoded more strongly, like when we repeat a phone number to ourselves until we have a chance to write it down. It is also easier to encode novel information that “builds” on previous bits of knowledge, or information that is closely related to other well-established information, which is why analogies are such an effective way to learn new facts. The process that enables memory storing is called consolidation, which makes the memory more permanent."
"In 1949, a student of Karl Lashley, the neuropsychologist Donald O. Hebb, offered an explanation for how changes in synapses could possibly lead to a phenomenon as complex as learning. His theory, published in his text The Organization of Behavior, can be summed up in the phrase: “Cells that fire together, wire together."
"” In Hebb’s framework, repeated activity at a synapse within a circuit of neurons acts as a reinforcer signal that strengthens this synapse for future communication, making the next incoming signal more robust. Hebb also implies the inverse is true: when cells do not fire together, they weaken their connection. Through fine tuning of synaptic connections, some strengthening and others weakening, a lifetime of memories can be stored across a wide distribution of neurons."
"After a memory has been created, the specific circuit of neurons that represent that piece of information is called a memory trace or an engram. A cellular process called reverberation is thought to be the mechanism that allows for consolidation. Reverberation is the process by which networks of neurons fire repeatedly."
"Each time that circuit is activated, the strength of the network is increased, meaning that it becomes easier for that circuit to be activated in the future. Throughout the process of consolidation, memory traces are thought to become more represented in the neocortex and less in the subcortical structures like the hippocampus or amygdala. Recall Patient HM’s temporally graded retrograde amnesia, where he had lost declarative memories in the two years leading up to this surgery, and yet his memories from the long past were maintained."
"This finding suggests that some aspects of declarative memory consolidation depends at least partially on medial temporal lobe and hippocampus for a period of time, maybe up to two years, before those memories get stored in the cortex more permanently. However, we cannot conclude how long consolidation takes in healthy humans based on findings from HM, who had pervasive and frequent seizures, which might have negatively impacted memory consolidation before the surgery. Consolidation seems to occur predominantly during sleep."
"Specifically, declarative memory is enhanced during non-REM sleep, while procedural memory is enhanced during REM sleep. Studies investigating sleep consolidation are often done by letting participants learn or perform behavioral tasks, after which they are deprived of a specific phase of sleep. To wake participants at the right moment, researchers commonly use EEG signatures, which are unique for different phases of sleep: sleep deprivation early in the night denies non-REM slow wave sleep, while late-sleep deprivation decreases time spent in REM sleep."
"Some speculate that the hallucinations we sometimes experience during dreaming are a consequence of consolidation processes, but it is inconclusive as to what role dreaming plays in memory formation. Finally, for the stored memories to be recalled, a cellular process called retrieval happens which brings back the specific engram. Retrieval happens for both declarative and procedural memories."
"The writing of memories can be differentiated from the retrieval of memories using specific priming-related behavioral tests. One example is a vocabulary recall test. Consider if you were given a list of 50 words to memorize, words that belong to a handful of different conceptual categories ."
"When asked to write down as many words as possible from the list using your memory, a test called free-recall, you may be able to successfully remember about a third of them. However, if you were prompted with the category titles, a related test called cued-recall, you would perform much better at retrieving those memories, possibly recalling up to 75% of the words. The fact that cued-recall scores are often higher than free-recall scores indicate that there is a distinction between the encoding / consolidation of memories and the retrieval of memories."
"Retrieval is not a passive function. When an engram is retrieved, it is reconsolidated, which is an act similar to replaying the activity of the circuit. During this reconsolidation, it is possible that some aspects of the memory are emphasized, while others are lost."
"This is likely the main reason why we experience false memories, memories that are not true to reality—one reason why eyewitness testimonies are notoriously unreliable. We may imagine our good memories as better than they actually were, while simultaneously dampening the negative aspects of those memories. A dysregulation of this reconsolidation process could lead to the symptoms seen in post-traumatic stress disorder, where the negative emotional components of a particular memory are exaggerated rather than being blunted."
"Through the 1960s, psychiatrist Eric Kandel and his colleagues Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard worked with the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Their work uncovering the neural mechanisms of learning and memory earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. With a nervous system of only 20,000 cells, Aplysia is orders of magnitude simpler than the other model organisms used at the time."
"Additionally, some Aplysia neurons are huge, up to a millimeter in diameter, which took away the need for highly precise equipment. Aplysia also has a relatively simple anatomy. It breathes using a half-circle of delicate tissue called the gill, which is guarded by the mantle shelf."
"They also have an organ called the siphon, a small tube that is used for moving water through the animal. Kandel and his colleagues began their exploration of memory by studying the gill-withdrawal reflex, a defensive motor response behavior. When a stimulus, such as a hungry predator , grazed the siphon, the Aplysia would reflexively withdraw their gill, as if to protect this vital organ by shrinking away from the threat."
"However, after repeated brush strokes to the siphon, the sea slugs figured out that the stimulus was completely innocuous and decreased the strength of gill withdrawal. Kandel and team suggested that this change in behavior was a form of learning. Kandel and colleagues used Aplysia to learn about the processes of habituation and sensitization."
"The gill-withdrawal reflex circuit relies heavily on two different populations of neurons: the glutamatergic sensory neurons that receive somatosensory information from the skin of the siphon, and the motor neurons that control the muscles of the gill. By using two different tiny glass pipettes, they could impale these neurons, inducing action potential firing in the sensory neuron, and observe changes in membrane potential of the motor neurons. Activation of the sensory neuron causes release of glutamate onto the motor neuron that controls the gill, binding to glutamatergic receptors and causing an EPSP response in the motor neuron."
"Although there was a strong gill withdrawal reflex following the one poke, Kandel and colleagues observed that after repeated pokes to the siphon, the gill withdrawal reflex got weaker. They found that the activity of the siphon neuron remained unchanged, however, the activity of the motor neuron supplying the gill decreased. The reflex had been habituated."
"This habituation was due to a decreased release of glutamate from the siphon sensory neuron onto the gill motor neuron. The group went about seeing if they could modify this habituated response, curious if a stored memory can be modified by stimuli from the outside world. When they paired the mild siphon touch with a painful electric shock to the tail, the Aplysia began responding with a strong motor reaction, withdrawing the gill very intensely, indicating that the inhibited response disappeared."
"They called this observation sensitization. In electrophysiological studies, they observed that the EPSP at the motor neuron was much larger following the tail shock. On a molecular level, presentation of sensitization is downstream of the action of a third population of neurons, serotonergic interneurons that synapse onto the siphon sensory neurons."
"The noxious stimulus triggers these interneurons to release the neurotransmitter serotonin, which binds to receptors on the terminals of the siphon sensory neurons, increasing adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP production. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which in turn increases the release of glutamate from the sensory neuron and strengthening the gill withdrawal reflex. Repeating the sensitization protocol multiple times results in plastic changes at the synapse between the sensory siphon neuron and the motor neuron."
"These plastic changes are long-lasting and dependent on new gene expression. The activated protein kinase A can translocate to the siphon sensory neuron nucleus to activate gene expression and the production of proteins that can remodel the anatomy of the synapse through the growth of additional sensory neuron axons, increasing synaptic connections. Zooming in beyond the level of anatomy, the substrates of learning can be found at the level of synapses."
"Synapses change in a phenomenon called plasticity. The word “plasticity” refers to a change in synaptic strength, which may be an increase or a decrease. This change may persist for minutes, hours, days, or in some cases, even a whole lifetime."
"When synaptic strength is increased and remains elevated, we call this long-term potentiation . A prolonged weakness of a synapse is called long-term depression . In our current limited understanding of plasticity, both phenomena are important for a healthy brain, and neither one is always good or always bad."
"It is also important to clarify that both excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses can be subject to either LTP or LTD. The hippocampus, meaning “seahorse” in Greek, was named based on its morphology. It is located along the ventral and medial surface of the brain."
"The hippocampus serves as one of the critical structures of the limbic system, a series of subcortical brain structures that are involved in several different complex behaviors, such as emotions and memory. The synaptic connectivity of the hippocampus is very well characterized. Hippocampal synaptic connectivity was first described by Ramon y Cajal, and is made up of three main synaptic connections; sometimes called the trisynaptic circuit."
"First, the entorhinal cortex serves as the major input to the hippocampus. This white matter signaling tract is called the perforant pathway, and the neurons synapse onto the granule cells within an area of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. The dentate gyrus neurons send their axons, called mossy fibers, to the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region of the hippocampus."
"The CA3 neurons have axonal projections called Schaffer collaterals that project out of the hippocampus via the fornix and also to neurons within an area of the hippocampus called CA1, which are also neurons that serve as an output of the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation  is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength, measured by the amplitude of the post-synaptic potential. Plasticity can be measured throughout these connections, but for our purposes we will examine how to create LTP within the Schaffer collateral."
"To create LTP within the Schaffer collateral, a brief electrical stimulus must be provided to the presynaptic axons coming from the CA3 cells via a stimulating electrode. The EPSP generated in the postsynaptic CA1 neurons is then measured with a recording electrode to establish a baseline. Using Hebb’s theory about plasticity, if “cells that fire together, wire together,” then it stands that repeated stimulation of that synapse would induce a rewiring of the connection, resulting in LTP."
"To induce LTP within these cells, a tetanus, or a very intense electrical stimulation consisting of 100 stimulations a second  is delivered to the presynaptic CA3 cells for 3 seconds. Following the delivery of tetanus, a single stimulus is provided again and the EPSP is then measured in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron. The delivery of the high frequency stimulation results in an increased amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP in response to a single stimulus, demonstrating that LTP is a measurable phenomenon."
"In many cases, LTP is shown graphically by measuring the EPSP amplitude as a percent of the control EPSP amplitude. Prior to tetanus delivery, the amplitude will be measured as 100%, or the same as control. Following tetanus, the amplitude of the EPSP will be larger than it was baseline, for instance 130% indicating a 30% increase in amplitude."
"Increasing the amplitude of the postsynaptic EPSP increases the likelihood of a neuron firing an action potential by increasing the neuron membrane potential such that it is closer to the threshold potential for the cell. It has been demonstrated in rodents that the elevated postsynaptic EPSP response is long-lasting and can remain elevated for upwards of one year. In humans, we theorize that some synaptic connections may remain potentiated for our entire lifetime, however investigating this is in humans is ethically constrained."
"Long-lasting changes in synaptic strength, such as the LTP, are made possible through a series of molecular and cellular level changes. One form of LTP results from a change in the types of glutamatergic receptors. Of the three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, two are important for this form of LTP: the AMPA and the NMDA receptors ."
"When a molecule of glutamate binds to the active site of the AMPA  receptor, the ligand-gated ion channel changes to the open conformation and allows the cations, sodium and potassium, to cross the cell membrane. Sodium moves into the cells more than potassium leaves the cell, leading to depolarization. The NMDA  receptor requires the binding of glutamate to open, but it is also dependent on voltage."
"The pore of the NMDA ligand-gated ion channel is blocked by a molecule of magnesium when the membrane potential is below or near resting membrane potential, preventing ions from moving through the channel. Once the cell depolarizes, the magnesium block is expelled from the receptor, which allows sodium, potassium, and calcium to cross the membrane. The voltage change needed to open the NMDA receptor is usually a result of AMPA receptor activation."
"Released glutamate binds to both AMPA and NMDA receptors, and sodium influx occurs through open AMPA channels, which depolarizes the cell enough to expel the magnesium ion and allow ion flow through the NMDA receptors. The calcium that enters the cell through the open NMDA receptors activates various kinases including, protein kinase A , protein kinase C , and calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II . Kinases phosphorylate target proteins within the cell, including AMPA receptors."
"Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors increases their conductance, allowing more ions to pass through the receptors and leading to a greater degree of depolarization. Further, increased intracellular calcium can lead to the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic cell membrane, which will also allow more sodium to move into the cell and lead to increased depolarization. Long-term potentiation increases the strength of synapses."
"Changes in activity can also cause synapses to be weakened through the process of long-term depression . Again, using the Schaffer collateral as an example, long-term depression can be induced at the synapses between the CA3 and CA1 neurons by replacing the tetanus stimulation with low-frequency stimulation for longer periods of time. For instance, a 15 min exposure to 1 Hz stimulation will lead to a decreased EPSP amplitude."
"Through LTP and LTD, synapses demonstrate bidirectional plasticity that is dependent on the type of stimulation that the synapse receives. Even with low-frequency stimulation of the synapse, glutamate will bind to post-synaptic NMDA receptors and allow for the influx of calcium into the cell. Weak depolarization of the membrane leads to a low amount of calcium entering the cell, which activates a separate class of enzymes call protein phosphatases, specifically protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2, that remove phosphate groups from target proteins."
"Further, LTD causes AMPA receptors to be internalized, or removed from the postsynaptic membrane. Removal of AMPA receptors will decrease excitability. To test how LTP And LTD are directly related to memory, a robust model of learning is used called Inhibitory Avoidance."
"In an inhibitory avoidance task, a rat learns to associate an environment with an aversive experience. Typically, a two-chamber compartment is used with one light side and one dark side. The animal is permitted to move from the light chamber to the dark chamber, where it receives an electric foot shock."
"After just one trial with this protocol, the animal will learn to avoid the dark chamber where it received the foot shock. One trial of inhibitory avoidance led to measurable LTP within the Schaffer collaterals, demonstrating that the behavioral learning corresponded to LTP during this task. Administration of an NMDA receptor blocker to the hippocampus prior to inhibitory avoidance training results in the animals being unable to learn that the dark chamber leads to a foot shock and inhibition of the corresponding LTP."
The neuron is composed of a number of specialized structures that are critical for proper functioning. Dendrites branch out from the cell body or soma like a tree. The word dendrite comes from the word for tree in Greek.
"The dendrites are the primary input zone for the cell and receive information from other cells. The number of inputs a neuron receives depends on the complexity of the dendritic branching. The soma houses the nucleus and most organelles and is the location of gene transcription, protein synthesis, vesicle packaging, and other cellular machinery mechanisms."
"The axon hillock is located at the transition of the soma and axon. It is the location where action potential propagation begins. The axon transmits electrical signals, called action potentials, from the cell body to the presynaptic terminal."
"Some axons are covered by myelin sheath, which is an insulating material that allows the action potential to travel down the axon faster. Between the myelin segments are the Nodes of Ranvier where the axonal cell membrane is open to the extracellular space. Ions can flow across the membrane at the Nodes, which allows for regeneration of the action potential."
"Finally, the presynaptic terminal is the output zone. After the action potential reaches the terminal, neurotransmitters are released into the synapse to send messages onto the next cell. Myelin increases the speed at which action potentials flow down the axon."
"If myelin was lost, action potentials would propagate down the axon at a slower rate or possibly not at all. Normal sensory, motor, and cognitive functions would be dysfunctional, depending on the location of the demyelination. Ions move from regions of high concentrations to regions of low concentrations by a process called diffusion."
"The concentration gradient will cause ions to diffuse across an impermeable membrane if there are open ion channels. Ions are also attracted to regions of opposite charge, so the electrical gradient will move cations toward a negative charge and anions toward a positive charge. When an ion is at equilibrium, there will be no net ion flow in either direction."
"The ions will still move however, there will simply be an equal number of ions moving into the cell than are moving out. The membrane potential is the difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of a cell. The extracellular solution is the reference point, so you should think of that as having no charge."
"If a cell has a membrane potential of -70 mV, that means the inside of the cell is more negative than the outside. Active neurons can have drastic changes in their membrane potentials, but the resting membrane potential is the difference in charge when the cell is not active. The membrane potential is the difference in charge inside the cell relative to the outside, so it takes into account permeability and concentration of all charged molecules when the cell is at rest."
"It is calculated by the Goldman equation. Equilibrium potential is the membrane potential at which one specific ion is at equilibrium, meaning there is no net movement of that ion in either direction. A cell would reach the equilibrium potential of an ion if the membrane were permeable to only that ion."
It is calculated by the Nernst equation. A change in potassium’s extracellular concentration had a much larger effect on the resting membrane potential compared to changed sodium’s extracellular concentration. The reason for this is because the membrane is significantly more permeable to potassium compared to sodium at rest.
"Since there are open channels, potassium can diffuse across the membrane and alter the resting membrane potential. Sodium may increase in concentration outside the cell, but without a way to cross the membrane, the membrane potential does not change. At rest, the neuronal membrane includes open non-gated potassium channels, fewer open chloride channels, very few open sodium channels, and sodium-potassium pumps."
The rising phase is a depolarization. The voltage-gated sodium channels are open. The voltage-gated potassium channels are closed.
The falling phase is a repolarization. The voltage-gated sodium channels are inactivated. The voltage-gated potassium channels are open.
The undershoot is a hyperpolarization. The voltage-gated sodium channels are closed. The voltage-gated potassium channels close during the undershoot.
"The absolute refractory period occurs when the voltage-gated sodium channels are either open during the rising phase or inactivated during the falling phase. The cell cannot fire a second action potential during the absolute refractory period. The voltage-gated sodium channels cannot reopen in response to a stimulus, regardless of the strength."
"The cell can fire a second action potential during the relative refractory period, but the strength of the stimulus must be stronger than when the cell is at rest since the membrane potential is hyperpolarized. The cell will require more stimulus to reach threshold. In this voltage-clamp experiment, the neuron is clamped at a membrane potential of 0 mV starting a the 1 msec time point."
"This depolarization is past threshold, so the voltage-gated sodium channels open transiently, increasing sodium permeability and allowing sodium ions to rush into the cell, shown by the inward ion flow on the graph. Briefly after opening, the voltage-gated sodium channels inactivate, preventing any further inward current. The delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium channels then open, increasing potassium permeability and allowing potassium ions to rush out of the cell, shown by the outward ion flow on the graph."
"An action potential arrives in the terminal The depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels Calcium interacts with synaptotagmin, a protein bound do synaptic vesicles Synaptotagmin interacts with the SNARE proteins, causing the synaptic vesicle membrane to fuse with the cellular membrane Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. With this repetitive firing comes a summation of individual EPSPs, which leads to an increase in depolarization. Once the depolarization reaches threshold, the cell will fire an action potential, but the recording electrode in this example is located in the cell body, not the axon, so action potentials will not be measured."
"Neurotransmitters can activate both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are themselves an ion channel, allowing direct ion flow after neurotransmitter binding. Action is immediate and rapid."
"Metabotropic receptors do not form an ion channel, and if they affect ion flow it is done indirectly via G-proteins. The effects are slower than ionotropic receptors and have broader actions. Metabotropic receptors can open ion channels, but they can also send second messengers into the cell, which have downstream cellular effect and can even alter gene transcription and protein translation."
"Rods and cones play specialized roles in the perception of sight. Physical appearance: Rods have an elongated, cylindrical outer segment; cones have a shorter, conical outer segment. Light sensitivity: Rods are highly sensitive to light and therefore are specialized for low light levels."
"Cones, on the other hand, have lower sensitivity to light, so they are specialized for bright light conditions. Location: Rods are almost completely excluded from fovea, but the fovea is the location of the majority of cones. Convergence: Rods have high convergence on bipolar cells; cones have low convergence and can have a 1 to 1 pairing of photoreceptor to bipolar The fovea is the region of greatest vision acuity."
It consists mainly of cone photoreceptors. The optic disc is the region where the ganglion cell axons leave the retina as the optic nerve. It is responsible for our blindspot because of the absence of photoreceptors in the region.
"Different areas of the body have different two-point discrimination thresholds. The more receptors that innervate an area, the smaller the receptive fields of those receptors, which leads to a smaller two-point discrimination threshold. The primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus – named because it is the gyrus just posterior to the central sulcus."
"Neurons traveling from brainstem will synapse in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus before traveling to the primary somatosensory cortex. As in previous editions, the goal of this sixth edition of Principles of Neural Science is to provide readers with insight into how genes, molecules, neurons, and the circuits they form give rise to behavior. With the exponential growth in neuroscience research over the 40 years since the first edition of this book, an increasing challenge is to provide a comprehensive overview of the field while remaining true to the original goal of the first edition, which is to elevate imparting basic principles over detailed encyclopedic knowledge."
"Some of the greatest successes in brain science over the past 75 years have been the elucidation of the cell biological and electrophysiological functions of nerve cells, from the initial studies of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz on the action potential and synaptic transmission to our modern understanding of the genetic and molecular biophysical bases of these fundamental processes. The first three parts of this book delineate these remarkable achievements. The first six chapters in Part I provide an overview of the broad themes of neural science, including the basic anatomical organization of the nervous system and the genetic bases of nervous system function and behavior."
"We have added a new chapter  to introduce the principles by which neurons participate in neural circuits that perform specific computations of behavioral relevance. We conclude by considering how application of modern imaging techniques to the human brain provides a bridge between neuroscience and psychology. The next two parts of the book focus on the basic properties of nerve cells, including the generation and conduction of the action potential  and the electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission ."
"We then consider how the activity of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous systems gives rise to sensation and movement. In Part IV, we discuss the various aspects of sensory perception, including how information from the primary organs of sensation is transmitted to the central nervous system and how it Preface is processed there by successive brain regions to generate a sensory percept. In Part V, we consider the neural mechanisms underlying movement, beginning with an overview of the field that is followed by a treatment ranging from the properties of skeletal muscle fibers to an analysis of how motor commands issued by the spinal cord are derived from activity in motor cortex and cerebellum."
"We include a new treatment that addresses how the basal ganglia regulate the selection of motor actions and instantiate reinforcement learning . In the latter parts of the book, we turn to higherlevel cognitive processes, beginning in Part VI with a discussion of the neural mechanisms by which subcortical areas mediate homeostatic control mechanisms, emotions, and motivation, and the influence of these processes on cortical cognitive operations, such as feelings, decision-making, and attention. We then consider the development of the nervous system in Part VII, from early embryonic differentiation and the initial establishment of synaptic connections, to their experience-dependent refinement, to the replacement of neurons lost to injury or disease."
"Because learning and memory can be seen as a continuation of synaptic development, we next consider memory, together with language, and include a new chapter on decisionmaking and consciousness  in Part VIII. Finally, in Part IX, we consider the neural mechanisms underlying diseases of the nervous system. Since the last edition of this book, the field of neuroscience has continued to rapidly evolve, which is reflected in changes in this edition."
The continued development of new electrophysiological and light microscopic–based imaging technologies has enabled the simultaneous recording of the activity of large populations of neurons in awake behaving animals. These large data sets have given rise to new computational and theoretical approaches to gain insight into how the activity of populations of neurons produce specific behaviors. Light microscopic imaging techniques  using genetically encoded calcium sensors allow us to record the activity of hundreds or thousands of defined classes of neurons with subcellular resolution as an animal engages in defined behaviors.
"At the same time, the development of genetically encoded light-activated ion channels and ion pumps  or genetically engineered receptors activated by synthetic ligands  can be used to selectively activate or silence genetically defined populations of neurons to examine their causal role in such behaviors. In addition to including such material in chapters throughout the book, we introduce some of these developments in the new Chapter 5, which considers both the new experimental technologies as well as computational principles by which neural circuits give rise to behavior. Over the past 20 years, there has also been an expansion of new technologies that enable noninvasive and invasive recordings from the human brain."
"These studies have narrowed the gap between neuroscience and psychology, as exemplified in the expanded discussion of different forms of human memory in Chapter 52. Noninvasive brain imaging methods have allowed scientists to identify brain areas in humans that are activated during cognitive acts. As discussed in a new chapter on the brain–machine interface , the implantation of electrodes in the brains of patients permits both electrophysiological recordings and local neural stimulation, offering the promise of restoring some function to individuals with damage to the central or peripheral nervous system."
"An understanding of basic and higher-order neural mechanisms is critical not only for our understanding of the normal function of the brain, but also for the insights they afford into a range of inherited and acquired neurological and psychiatric disorders. With modern genetic sequencing, it is now clear that inherited or spontaneous mutations in neuronally expressed genes contribute to brain disease. At the same time, it is also clear that environmental factors interact with basic genetic mechanisms to influence disease progression."
"We now end the book with a new section, Part IX, which presents the neuroscientific principles underlying disorders of the nervous system. In previous editions, many of these chapters were dispersed throughout the book. However, we now group these chapters in their own part based on the increasing appreciation that the underlying causes of what appear to be separate diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, share certain common principles."
"Finally, these chapters emphasize the historical tradition of how studies of brain disease provide deep insights into normal brain function, including memory and consciousness. In writing this latest edition, it is our hope and goal that readers will emerge with an appreciation of the achievements of modern neuroscience and the challenges facing future generations of neuroscientists. By emphasizing how neuroscientists in the past have devised experimental approaches to resolve fundamental questions and controversies in the field, we hope that this textbook will also encourage readers to think critically and not shy away from questioning received wisdom, for every hard-won truth likely will lead to new and perhaps more profound questions in brain science."
"Thus, it is our hope that this sixth edition of Principles of Neural Science will provide the foundation and motivation for the next generation of neuroscientists to formulate and investigate these questions. The capacity for movement, as many dictionaries remind us, is a defining feature of animal life. As Sherrington, who pioneered the study of the motor system pointed out, “to move things is all that mankind can do, for such the sole executant is muscle, whether in whispering a syllable or in felling a forest."
"”* The immense repertoire of motions that humans are capable of stems from the activity of some 640 skeletal muscles—all under the control of the central nervous system. After processing sensory information about the body and its surroundings, the motor centers of the brain and spinal cord issue neural commands that effect coordinated, purposeful movements. The task of the motor systems is the reverse of the task of the sensory systems."
"Sensory processing generates an internal representation in the brain of the outside world or of the state of the body. Motor processing begins with an internal representation: the desired purpose of movement. Critically, however, this internal representation needs to be continuously updated by internally generated information  and external sensory information to maintain accuracy as the movement unfolds."
"Just as psychophysical analysis of sensory processing tells us about the capabilities and limitations of the sensory systems, psychophysical analyses of motor performance reveal the control rules used by the motor system. Because many of the motor acts of daily life are unconscious, we are often unaware of their complexity. Simply standing upright, for example, requires continual adjustments of numerous postural muscles in response to the vestibular signals evoked by miniscule swaying."
"Walking, running, and other forms of locomotion involve the combined action of central pattern generators, gated sensory information, and descending commands, which together generate the complex patterns of alternating excitation and inhibition to the appropriate sets of muscles. Many actions, such as serving a tennis ball or executing an arpeggio on a piano, occur far too quickly to be shaped by sensory feedback. Instead, centers, such as the cerebellum, make use of predictive models that simulate the consequences of the outgoing commands and allow very short latency corrections."
"Motor learning provides one of the most fruitful subjects for studies of neural plasticity. Motor systems are organized in a functional hierarchy, with each level concerned with a different decision. The highest and most abstract level, likely requiring the prefrontal cortex, deals with the purpose of a movement or series of motor actions."
"The next level, which is concerned with the formation of a motor plan, involves interactions between the posterior parietal and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex. The premotor cortex specifies the spatiotemporal characteristics of a movement based on sensory information from the posterior parietal cortex about the environment and about the position of the body in space. The lowest level of the hierarchy coordinates the spatiotemporal details of the muscle contractions needed to execute the planned movement."
"This coordination is executed by the primary motor cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. This serial view has heuristic value, but evidence suggests that many of these processes can occur in parallel. Some functions of the motor systems and their disturbance by disease have now been described at the level of the biochemistry of specific transmitter systems."
"In fact, the discovery that neurons in the basal ganglia of parkinsonian patients are deficient in dopamine was the first important clue that neurological disorders in the central nervous system can result from altered chemical transmission. Neurophysiological studies have provided information as to how such transmitters play a critical role in action selection and the reinforcement of successful movements. Understanding the functional properties of the motor system is not only fundamental in its own right, but it is of further importance in helping us to understand disorders of this system and explore the possibilities for treatment and recovery."
"As would be expected for such a complex apparatus, the motor system is subject to various malfunctions. Disruptions at different levels in the motor hierarchy produce distinctive symptoms, including the movement-slowing characteristic of disorders of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson disease, the incoordination seen with cerebellar disease, and the spasticity and weakness typical of spinal cord damage. For this reason, the neurological examination of a patient inevitably includes tests of reflexes, gait, and dexterity, all of which provide information about the status of the nervous system."
"In addition to pharmacological therapies, the treatment of motor system disorders has been augmented by two new approaches. First, focal stimulation of the basal ganglia has been shown to restore motility to certain patients with Parkinson disease; such deep-brain stimulation is also being tested in the context of other neurological and psychiatric conditions. And second, the motor systems have become a target for the application of neural prosthetics; neural signals are decoded and used to drive devices that aid patients with paralysis caused by spinal cord injury and stroke."
"Understanding the normal function of the nervous system is central to understanding dysfunction caused by disease or injury and designing therapies. Such treatments include pharmacological agents, surgical interventions, and, increasingly, electronic medical devices. These medical devices fill an important gap between largely molecularly targeted and systemic medications and largely anatomically targeted and focal surgical lesions."
"In this chapter, we focus on medical devices that measure or alter electrophysiological activity at the level of populations of neurons. These devices are referred to as brain–machine interfaces , brain– computer interfaces, or neural prostheses. We use the term BMI to refer to all such devices because there is no standard distinction among them."
"BMIs can be organized into four broad categories: those that restore lost sensory capabilities, those that restore lost motor capabilities, those that regulate pathological neural activity, and those that restore lost brain processing capabilities. BMIs can help people perform “activities of daily living,” such as feeding oneself, physically dressing and grooming oneself, maintaining continence, and walking. A type of BMI that we will discuss extensively in this chapter converts electrical activity from neurons in the brain into signals that control prosthetic devices to help people with paralysis."
"By understanding how neuroscience and neuroengineering work together to create current BMIs, we can more clearly envision how many neurological diseases and injuries can be treated with medical devices. One of the earliest and most widely used BMIs is the cochlear implant. People with profound deafness can benefit from restoration of even some audition."
"Since the 1970s, several hundred thousand people who have a peripheral cause of deafness that leaves the cochlear nerve and central auditory pathways intact have received cochlear implants. These systems have restored considerable hearing and spoken language, even to children with congenital deafness who have learned to perceive speech using cochlear implants. Cochlear implants operate by capturing sounds with a microphone that resides outside the skin and sending these signals to a receiver surgically implanted under the skin near the ear."
"After conversion  to appropriate spatial-temporal signal patterns, these signals electrically stimulate spiral ganglion cells in the cochlear modiolus . In turn, signals from the activated cochlear cells are transmitted through the auditory nerve to the brain stem and higher auditory areas where, ideally, the neural signals are interpreted as the sounds captured by the microphone. Another example of a BMI is a retinal prosthesis."
"Blindness can be caused by diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited retinal degenerative disease. At present, there is no cure and no approved medical therapy to slow or reverse the disease. Retinal prostheses currently enable patients to recognize large letters and locate the position of objects."
"They operate by capturing images with a camera and sending these signals to a receiver positioned within the eye. After conversion to appropriate spatial-temporal patterns, these electrical signals stimulate retinal ganglion cells in the retina through dozens of electrodes. In turn, these cells send their signals through the optic nerve to the thalamus and higher visual areas where, ideally, the afferent signals are interpreted as the image captured by the camera."
"BMIs are also being developed to assist paralyzed people and amputees by restoring lost motor and communication function. This is the central topic of this chapter. First, electrical neural activity in one or more brain areas is measured using penetrating multielectrode arrays placed, for example, in the arm and hand region of the primary motor cortex, dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, and/or intraparietal cortex  ."
"Second, an arm movement is attempted but cannot be made in the case of people with paralysis. Action potentials and local field potentials are measured during these attempts. With 100 electrodes placed in the primary motor cortex and another 100 in the dorsal premotor cortex, for example, action potentials from approximately 200 neurons and local field potentials from 200 electrodes are measured."
"Local field potentials are lower-frequency signals recorded on the same electrodes as the action potentials and believed to arise from local synaptic currents of many neurons near the electrode tips. Together, these neural signals contain considerable information about how the person wishes to move her arm. Third, the relationship between neural activity and attempted movements is characterized."
"This relationship makes it possible to predict the desired movement from new neural activity, a statistical procedure we refer to as neural decoding. Fourth, the BMI is then operated in its normal mode where neural activity is measured in real time and desired movements are decoded from the neural activity by a computer. The decoded movements can be used to guide prosthetic devices, such as a cursor on a computer screen or a robotic arm."
"It is also possible to electrically stimulate muscles in a paralyzed limb to enact the decoded movements, a procedure known as functional electrical stimulation. Many other prosthetic devices can be envisioned as we increasingly interact with the world around us electronically . Finally, because the person can see the prosthetic device, she can alter her neural activity by thinking different thoughts on a moment-by-moment basis so as to guide the prosthetic device more accurately."
"This closed-loop feedback control system can make use of nonvisual sensory modalities as well, including delivering pressure and position information from electronic sensors wrapped on or embedded in a prosthetic arm. Such surrogate sensory information can be transformed into electrical stimulation patterns that are delivered to proprioceptive and somatosensory cortex. The BMIs described above include motor and communication BMIs."
"Motor BMIs aim to provide natural control of a robotic limb or a paralyzed limb. In the case of upper-limb prostheses, this involves the  precise movement of the arm along a desired path and with a desired speed profile. Such control is indeed an ambitious ultimate goal, but even intermediate steps toward this goal could improve quality of life by restoring some lost motor function and improving the patient’s ability to carry out “activities of daily living."
"” For example, numerous people with tetraplegia could benefit from being able to feed themselves. Communication BMIs are designed to provide a fast and accurate interface with a plethora of electronic devices. The ability to move a computer cursor around an on-screen keyboard allows a patient to type commands for computers, smart phones, voice synthesizers, smart homes, and the “internet of things."
"” Ideally, communication BMIs would allow for a communication rate at which most people speak or type. Such BMIs would benefit people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , who often become “locked in” and unable to communicate with the outside world through any movements. Communication BMIs would also benefit people with other neurodegenerative diseases that severely compromise the quality of movement and speech, as well as those with upper spinal cord injury."
"The ability to reliably type several words per minute is a meaningful improvement in quality of life for many patients. Motor and communication BMIs build on basic neuroscientific research in voluntary movement . The design and development of BMIs have so far depended on laboratory animal research, largely with nonhuman primates; recently, however, pilot clinical trials with humans with paralysis have begun."
"BMIs have been developed to help people with disorders involving pathological neural activity in the brain, such as Parkinson disease and epilepsy. People with Parkinson disease benefit by having hand and arm tremor reduced. At present, there is no cure for Parkinson disease, and many people become resistant to pharmacological treatments."
"A deep brain stimulator  can help these people by delivering electrical pulses to targeted areas in the brain to disrupt the aberrant neural activity. DBS is controlled by a neurostimulator implanted in the chest, with wires to stimulating electrodes in deep brain nuclei . The nuclei are continuously stimulated with these electrodes in order to alter the aberrant neural activity."
"This method can often greatly reduce Parkinson disease– related tremor for years. A DBS applied to different brain areas can also help people with essential tremor, dystonia, chronic pain, major depression, and obsessivecompulsive disorder. Millions of people experiencing epileptic seizures are currently treated with antiseizure medications or neurosurgery, both of which often result in incomplete or impermanent seizure reduction."
Antiseizure BMIs have shown considerable promise for further improving quality of life. These fully implanted BMIs operate by continuously monitoring neural activity in a brain region determined to be involved with seizures. They identify unusual activity that is predictive of seizure onset and then respond within milliseconds to disrupt this activity by electrically stimulating the same or a different brain region.
"This closed-loop response can be fast enough that seizure symptoms are not felt and seizures do not occur. BMIs are capable of restoring more than lost sensory or motor capabilities. They are, in principle, capable of restoring internal brain processing."
"Of the four categories of BMIs, this is the most futuristic. An example is a “replacement part” BMI. The central idea is that if enough is known about the function of a brain region, and if this region is damaged by disease or injury, then it may be possible to replace this brain region."
"Once the normal input activity to a brain region is measured , the function of the lost brain region could then be modeled in electronic hardware and software, and the output from this substitute processing center would then be delivered to the next brain region as though no injury had occurred. This would involve, for example, reading out neural activity with electrodes, mimicking the brain region’s computational functions with low-power microelectronic circuits, and then writing in electrical neural activity with stimulating electrodes. This procedure might also be used to initiate and guide neural plasticity."
"A replacement part BMI that is currently being investigated focuses on restoring memory by replacing parts of the hippocampus that are damaged due to injury or disease. Another potential application would be to restore the lost functionality of a brain region damaged by stroke. These systems represent the natural evolution of the BMI concept, a so-called “platform technology” because a large number of systems can be envisioned by mixing and matching various write-in, computational, and read-out components."
The number of neurological diseases and injuries that BMIs should be able to help address ought to increase as our understanding of the functions of the nervous system and the sophistication of the technology continue to grow. Measuring and modulating neural activity involves four broad areas of electronic technologies applied to the nervous system . The first area is the type of neural sensor; artificial neural sensors are designed with different levels of invasiveness and spatial resolution .
"Sensors that are external to the body, such as an electroencephalogram  cap, have been used extensively in recent decades. The EEG measures signals from many small metal disks  applied to the surface of the scalp across the head. Each electrode detects average activity from a large number of neurons beneath it."
"More recently, implantable electrode-array techniques, such as subdural electrocorticography  and finely spaced micro-ECoG electrodes, have been used. Since ECoG electrodes are on the surface of the brain and are thus much closer to neurons than EEG electrodes, ECoG has higher spatial and temporal resolution and thus provides more information with which to control BMIs. Most recently, arrays of penetrating intracortical electrodes, which we focus on in this chapter, have been used."
"The intracortical electrode arrays are made of silicon or other materials and coated with biocompatible materials. The arrays are implanted on the surface of the brain, with the electrode tips penetrating 1 to 2 mm into the cortex. They have the ability to record action potentials from individual neurons, as well as local field potentials from small clusters of neurons near each electrode tip."
"The electrodes are able to record high-fidelity signals because they are inserted into the brain, bringing the electrode tips within micrometers of neurons. This is beneficial for BMI performance because individual neurons are the fundamental information-encoding units in the nervous system, and action potentials are the fundamental units of the digital code that carries information from the input to the output region of a neuron. Moreover, intracortical electrodes can deliver electrical microstimulation to either disrupt neural activity  or write in surrogate information ."
"The second area of neurotechnology is scaling up the number of neurons measured at the same time. While one neuron contains some information about a person’s intended movement, tens to hundreds of neurons are needed to move a BMI more naturally, and even more neurons are needed to approach naturalistic levels of motor function. Although it is possible to place electrode arrays in many areas across the brain, thereby gaining more information from multiple areas, a key challenge is to measure activity from thousands of neurons within each individual brain area."
"Many efforts are underway to achieve this goal, including use of electrode arrays with many tiny shafts, each with hundreds of electrode contacts along its length; many tiny electrodes that are not physically wired together, but are instead inserted into the brain as stand-alone islands that transmit data outside of the head and receive power wirelessly; and optical imaging technologies that can capture the activity of hundreds or more neurons by detecting how each neuron’s fluorescence changes over time. The third area is low-power electronics for signal acquisition, wireless data communications, and wireless powering. In contrast to the BMI systems described above, which implant a passive electrode array in which each electrode is wired to the outside world by a connector passing through the skin, future BMIs will be fully implanted like DBS systems."
"Electronic circuits are needed to amplify neural signals, digitize them, process them , and transmit this information to a nearby receiver incorporated into a prosthetic arm, for example. Power consumption must be minimized for two reasons. First, the more power is consumed, the more power a battery or a wireless charging system would need to provide."
"Batteries would therefore need to be larger and replaced more often, and delivering power wirelessly is challenging. Second, using power generates heat, and the brain can only tolerate a small temperature increase before there are deleterious effects. These trade-offs are similar to those of smart phones, which represent the current best technology available for low-power electronics."
"The final area is so-called supervisory systems. Software running on electronic hardware is at the heart of BMIs. Some software implements the mathematical operations of the neural decoding, while other software must tend to aspects of the BMI’s overall operation."
"For example, the supervisory software should monitor whether or not a person wishes to use the prosthesis ; if neural signals have changed, thereby requiring recalibration of the decoder; and overall BMI performance and safety. Having discussed the range of different BMIs and neurotechnologies being developed, in the rest of this chapter we focus on motor and communication BMIs. We first describe different types of decoding algorithms and how they work."
"We then describe recent progress in BMI development toward assisting paralyzed people and amputees. Next, we consider how sensory feedback can improve BMI performance and how BMIs can be used as an experimental paradigm to address basic scientific questions about brain function. Finally, we conclude with a cautionary note about ethical issues that can arise with BMIs."
"Various aspects of movement—including position, velocity, acceleration, and force—are encoded in the activity of neurons throughout the motor system . Even though our understanding of movement encoding in the motor system is incomplete, there is usually a reliable relationship between aspects of movement and neural activity. This reliable relationship allows us to estimate the desired movement from neural activity, a key component of a BMI."
"To study movement encoding, one typically considers the activity of an individual neuron across repeated movements  to the same target. The activity of the neuron can be averaged across many trials to create a spike histogram for each target . By comparing the spike histograms for different targets, one can characterize how the neuron’s activity varies with the movement produced."
"One can also assess using the spike histograms whether the neuron is more involved in movement preparation or movement execution. In contrast, estimating a subject’s desired movement from neural activity  needs to be performed on an individual trial while the neural activity is being recorded. The activity of a single neuron cannot unambiguously provide such information."
"Thus, the BMI must monitor the activity of many neurons on a single trial  rather than one neuron on many trials. A desired movement can be decoded from the neural activity associated with either preparation or execution of the movement. Whereas preparation activity is related to the movement goal execution activity is related to the moment-by-moment details of movement ."
"Millions of neurons across multiple brain areas work together to produce a movement as simple as reaching for a cup. Yet in many BMIs, desired movements can be decoded reasonably accurately from the activity of dozens of neurons recorded from a single brain area. Although this may seem surprising, the fact is that the motor system has a great deal of redundancy—many neurons carry similar information about a desired movement ."
"This is reasonable because millions of neurons are involved in controlling the contractions of dozens of muscles. Thus, most of the neurons in regions of dorsal premotor cortex and primary motor cortex controlling arm movement are informative about most arm movements. When decoding a movement, the activity of one neuron provides only incomplete information about the movement, whereas the activity of many neurons can provide substantially more accurate information about the movement."
"This is true for activity associated with both movement preparation and execution. There are two reasons why using multiple neurons is helpful for decoding. First, a typical neuron alone cannot unambiguously determine the intended movement direction."
"Consider a neuron whose activity  is related to movement direction via a cosine function, known as a tuning curve . If this neuron fires at 30 spikes per second, the intended movement direction could be either 120° or 240°. However, by recording from a second neuron whose tuning curve is different from that of the first neuron, the movement direction can be  more accurately determined."
"If the second neuron fires at 5 spikes per second, corresponding to a movement in either the 60° or 120° direction, the only movement direction that is consistent between the two neurons is 120° . Thus, by recording from these two neurons simultaneously, the intended reach direction can be determined more accurately than by recording from one neuron. The second reason why decoding a movement from the activity of several neurons gives greater accuracy is because a neuron’s activity level usually varies across repeated movements in the same direction."
"This variability is typically referred to as spiking “noise. ” Let us say that due to spiking noise the first neuron fires at slightly less than 30 spikes per second and the second neuron fires at slightly more than 5 spikes per second . Under these conditions, no single movement direction is consistent with the activity level of both neurons."
"Instead, a compromise must be made between the two neurons to determine a movement direction that is as consistent as possible with their activities. By extending this concept to more than two neurons, the movement direction can be decoded even more accurately as the number of neurons increases. Movement decoders are a central component of BMIs."
There are two types of BMI decoders: discrete and continuous . A discrete decoder estimates one of several possible movement goals. Each of these movement goals could correspond to a letter on a keyboard.
"A discrete decoder solves a classification problem in statistics and can be applied to either preparation activity or execution activity. A continuous decoder estimates the moment-by-moment details of a movement trajectory. This is important, for example, for reaching around obstacles or turning a steering wheel."
"A continuous decoder solves a regression problem in statistics and is usually applied to execution activity rather than preparation activity because the moment-by-moment details of a movement can be more accurately estimated from execution activity . Motor BMIs must produce movement trajectories as accurately as possible to achieve the desired movement and typically use a continuous decoder to do this. In contrast, communication BMIs are concerned with enabling the individual to transmit information as rapidly as possible."
"Thus, the speed and accuracy with which movement goals  can be selected are of primary importance. Communication BMIs can use a discrete decoder to directly select a desired key on a keyboard or a continuous decoder to continuously guide the cursor to the desired key, where only the key eventually struck actually contributes to information conveyance. This seemingly subtle distinction has implications that influence the type of neural activity required and therefore the brain area that is targeted, as well as the type of decoder that is used."
"Neural decoding involves two phases: calibration and ongoing use. In the calibration phase, the relationship between neural activity and movement is characterized by a statistical model. This can be achieved by recording neural activity while a paralyzed person attempts to move, imagines moving, or passively observes movements of a computer cursor or robotic limb."
"Once the relationship has been defined, the statistical model can then be used to decode new observed neural activity . The goal during the ongoing use phase is to find the movement that is most consistent with the observed neural activity . We first define a population activity space, where each axis represents the firing rate of one neuron."
"On each trial , we can measure the firing rate of each neuron during a specified period, and together they yield one point in the population activity space. Across many trials, involving multiple movement goals, there will be a scatter of points in the population activity space. If the neural activity is related to the movement goal, then the points will be separated in the population activity space according to the movement goal ."
"During the calibration phase, decision boundaries that partition the population activity space into different regions are determined by a statistical model. Each region corresponds to one movement goal. During the ongoing use phase, we measure new neural activity for which the movement goal is unknown ."
"The decoded movement goal is determined by the region in which the neural activity lies. For example, if the neural activity lies within the region corresponding to the leftward target, then the discrete decoder would guess that the subject intended to move to the leftward target on that trial. It is possible that the subject intended to move to the rightward target, even though the recorded activity lies within the region corresponding to the leftward target."
"In this case, the discrete decoder would incorrectly estimate the subject’s intended movement goal. Decoding accuracy typically increases with an increasing number of simultaneously recorded neurons. Arm position, velocity, acceleration, force, and other aspects of arm movement can be decoded using the methods described here with varying levels of accuracy."
"For concreteness, we will discuss decoding movement velocity because it is one of the quantities most strongly reflected in the activity of motor cortical  neurons and is the starting point for the design of most BMI systems. Consider a population of neurons whose level of activity indicates the movement velocity . During the calibration phase, a “pushing vector” is determined for each neuron ."
"A pushing vector indicates how a neuron’s activity influences movement velocity. Various continuous decoding algorithms differ in how they determine the pushing vectors. One of the earliest decoding algorithms, the population vector algorithm , assigns each neuron’s pushing vector to point along the neuron’s preferred direction ."
"A neuron’s preferred direction is defined as the direction of movement for which the neuron shows the highest level of activity . Much of the pioneering work on BMIs used the PVA. However, the PVA does not take into account the properties of the spiking noise , which influences the accuracy of the decoded movements."
"A more accurate decoder, the optimal linear estimator , incorporates the properties of the spiking noise to determine the pushing vectors. During the ongoing use phase, the pushing vectors are each scaled by the number of spikes emitted by the corresponding neuron at each time step . At each time step, the decoded movement is the vector sum of the scaled pushing vectors across all neurons."
"The decoded movement represents a change in position during one time step . The BMI cursor  position  is then updated according to the decoded movement. To further improve decoding accuracy, the estimation of velocity at each time step should take into account not only current neural activity , but also neural activity in the recent past."
"The rationale is that movement velocity  changes gradually over time, and so neural activity in the recent past should be informative about the movement velocity. This can be achieved by temporally smoothing the neural activity before applying a PVA or OLE or by using a Kalman filter to define a statistical model describing how movement velocity  changes smoothly over time. With a Kalman filter, the estimated velocity is a combination of the scaled pushing vectors at the current time step  and the estimated velocity at the previous time step."
"Indeed, continuous decoding algorithms that take into account neural activity in the recent past have been shown to provide higher decoding accuracy than those that do not. The Kalman filter and its extensions are widely used in BMIs and among the most accurate continuous decoding algorithms available. Patients with paralysis wish to perform activities of daily living."
"For people with ALS or upper spinal cord injury who are unable to speak or to move their arms, the most desired tasks are often the ability to communicate, to move a prosthetic  arm, or to move the paralyzed arm by stimulating the musculature. Having described how neural signals can be read out from motor areas of the brain and how these electrical signals can be decoded to arrive at BMI control signals, we now describe recent progress toward restoring these abilities. The majority of laboratory studies are carried out in able-bodied nonhuman primates, although paralysis is sometimes transiently induced in important control experiments."
"Three types of experimental paradigms are in broad use, differing in the exact way in which arm behavior is instructed and visual feedback is provided during BMI calibration and ongoing use. Setting these differences aside, we focus below on how BMIs function and perform. We also highlight recent pilot clinical trials with people with paralysis."
"To investigate how quickly and accurately a communication BMI employing a discrete decoder and preparation activity can operate, monkeys were trained to fixate and touch central targets and prepare to reach to a peripheral target that could appear at one of several different locations on a computer screen. Spikes were recorded using electrodes implanted in the premotor cortex. The number of spikes occurring during a particular time window during the preparation epoch was used to predict where the monkey was preparing to reach ."
"If the decoded target matched the peripheral target, a liquid reward was provided to indicate a successful trial. By varying the duration of the period in which spike counts are taken and the number of possible targets, it was possible to assess the speed and accuracy of target selections . Decoding accuracy tended to increase with the period in which spike counts are taken because spiking noise is more easily averaged out in longer periods."
"An important metric for efficient communication is information transfer rate , which measures how much information can be conveyed per unit time. A basic unit of information is a bit, which is specified by a binary value . For example, with three bits of information, one can specify which of 23  = 8 possible targets or keys to press."
"Thus, the metric for ITR is bits per second . ITR increases with the period in which spike counts are taken, then declines. The reason is that ITR takes into account both how accurately and how quickly each target is selected."
"Beyond some point of diminishing returns of a longer period, accuracy fails to increase rapidly enough to overcome the slowdown in target-selection rate accompanying a longer period. Overall performance  increases with the number of possible targets, despite a decrease in decoding accuracy, because each correct target selection conveys more information. Fast and accurate communication  has been demonstrated in BMIs with this design based on a discrete decoder applied to preparatory activity."
"The ITR of this BMI is approximately 6. 5 bps, which corresponds to approximately two to three targets per second with greater than 90% accuracy. Recent studies have also investigated how quickly and accurately a communication BMI employing a continuous decoder and execution activity can operate."
Two different types of continuous decoders were evaluated: a standard Kalman filter decoding movement velocity  and a recalibrated feedback intention-trained Kalman filter . The V-KF was calibrated using the neural activity recorded during actual arm movements . The ReFIT-KF incorporated the closed-loop nature of BMIs into decoder calibration by assuming that the user desired to move the cursor straight to the target at each time step.
"To assess performance, both types of decoders were used in closed-loop BMI control . Monkeys were required to move a computer cursor from a central location to eight peripheral locations and back. A gold standard for performance evaluation was established by having the monkeys also perform the same task using arm movements."
"The ReFIT-KF outperformed the V-KF in several ways: Cursor movements using ReFIT-KF were straighter, producing less movement away from a straight line to the target; cursor movements were faster, approaching the speed of arm movements ; and there were fewer  long trials. Given its performance benefits, the ReFIT-KF is being used in clinical trials by people with paralysis . Spiking activity was recorded using a 96-channel electrode array implanted in the hand control area of the left motor cortex."
"Signals were filtered to extract action potentials and high-frequency local field potentials, which were decoded to provide “point-and-click” control of the BMI-controlled cursor. The subject was seated in front of a computer monitor and was asked, “How did you encourage your sons to practice music? ” By attempting to move her right hand, the computer cursor moved across the screen and stopped over the desired letter."
"By attempting to squeeze her left hand, the letter beneath the cursor was selected, much like clicking a mouse button. BMI performance in the clinical trials was assessed by measuring the number of intended characters subjects were able to type . Subjects were able to demonstrate that the letters they typed were intended by using the delete key to erase occasional mistakes."
"These clinical tests showed that it is possible to type at a rate of many words per minute using a BMI. Patients with paralysis would like to pick up objects, feed themselves, and generally interact physically with the world. Motor BMIs with prosthetic limbs aim to restore this lost motor functionality."
"As before, neural activity is decoded from the brain but is now routed to a robotic arm where the wrist is moved in three dimensions  and the hand is moved in an additional dimension . In one test of a robotic arm, a patient with paralysis was able to use her neural activity to direct the robotic arm to reach out, grab a bottle of liquid, and bring it to her mouth . The three-dimensional reaches and gripping were slower and less accurate than natural arm and hand movements."
"Importantly, this demonstrated that the same BMI paradigm originally developed with animals, including measuring and decoding signals from motor cortex, works in people even years after the onset of neural degeneration or the time of neural injury. BMI devices directing prosthetic arms and hands are now able to do more than just control threedimensional movement or open and close the hand. They can also orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects."
"A person with paralysis was able to move a prosthetic limb with 10 degrees of freedom to grasp objects of different shapes and sizes and move them from one place to another . Completion times for grasping and moving objects were considerably slower than natural arm movements, but the results are encouraging. These studies illustrate the existing capabilities of prosthetic arms and also the potential for even greater capabilities in the future."
"An alternative to using a robotic arm is to restore lost motor function to the biological arm. Arm paralysis results from the loss of neural signaling from the spinal cord and brain, but the muscles themselves are often still intact and can be made to contract by electrical stimulation. This capacity underlies functional electrical stimulation , which sends electrical signals via internal or external electrodes to a set of muscle groups."
"By shaping and timing the electrical signals sent to the different muscle groups, FES is able to move the arm and hand in a coordinated fashion to pick up objects. Laboratory studies in monkeys have demonstrated that this basic approach is viable in principle. It is implemented by calibrating a continuous decoder to predict the intended activity of each of several of the muscles, transiently paralyzed with a nerve block."
"These predictions are then used to control the intensity of stimulation of the same paralyzed muscles, which in turn controls motor outputs such as a grip angle and force. This process in effect bypasses the spinal cord and restores some semblance of voluntary control of the paralyzed arm and hand. Similar results have recently been demonstrated in patients with paralysis using either externally applied or fully implanted state-of-the-art FES electrodes."
"Intracortically recorded signals from motor cortex were decoded to restore movement via FES in a person with upper spinal cord injury . The subject was able to achieve control of different wrist and hand motions, including finger movements, and perform various activities of daily living. During arm movements, we rely on multiple sources of sensory feedback to guide the arm along a desired path or to a desired goal."
"These sources include visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory feedback. However, in most current BMI systems, the user receives only visual feedback about the movements of the computer cursor or robotic limb. In patients with normal motor output pathways but lacking proprioception, arm movements are substantially less accurate than in healthy individuals, both in terms of movement direction and extent."
"Furthermore, in tests of BMI cursor control in healthy nonhuman primate subjects, the arm continues to provide proprioceptive feedback even though arm movements are not required to move the cursor. BMI cursor control is more accurate when the arm is passively moved together with the BMI cursor along the same path, rather than along a different path. This demonstrates the importance of “correct” proprioceptive feedback."
"Based on these two lines of evidence, it is perhaps not surprising that BMI-directed movements relying solely on visual feedback are slower and less accurate than normal arm movements. This has motivated recent attempts to demonstrate how providing surrogate  proprioceptive or somatosensory feedback can improve BMI performance. Several studies have attempted to write in sensory information by stimulating the brain using cortical electrical microstimulation."
"Laboratory animals can discriminate current pulses of different frequencies and amplitudes, and this ability can be utilized to provide proprioceptive or somatosensory information in BMIs by using different pulse frequencies to encode different physical locations  or different textures . Electrical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex can be used by nonhuman primates to control a cursor on a moment-by-moment basis without vision. In these subjects, the use of electrical microstimulation  and visual feedback together led to more accurate movements than either type of sensory feedback alone."
"Furthermore, electrical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex can also be used to provide tactile information. Nonhuman primates moved a BMIdirected cursor under visual feedback to hit different visual targets, each of which elicited a different stimulation frequency. Subjects learned to use differences in the stimulation feedback to distinguish the rewarded target from the unrewarded targets."
"This demonstrates that electrical microstimulation can also be used to provide somatosensory feedback during BMI control. Finally, surrogate somatosensory information was delivered via electrical microstimulation to a person with paralysis and compromised sensory afferents. The person reported naturalistic sensations at different locations of his hand and fingers corresponding to different locations of stimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex."
"BMIs are becoming an increasingly important experimental tool for addressing basic scientific questions about brain function. For example, cochlear implants have provided insight into how the brain processes sounds and speech, how the development of these mechanisms is shaped by language acquisition, and how neural plasticity allows the brain to interpret a few channels of stimulation carrying impoverished auditory information. Similarly, motor and communication BMIs are helping to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control."
"Such scientific findings can then be used to refine the design of BMIs. The key benefit of BMIs for basic science is that they can simplify the brain’s input and output interface with the outside world, without simplifying the complexities of brain processing that one wishes to study. To illustrate this point, consider the output interface of the brain for controlling arm movements."
"Thousands of neurons from the motor cortex and other brain areas send signals down the spinal cord and to the arm, where they activate muscles that move the arm. Understanding how the brain controls arm movement is challenging because one can typically record from only a small fraction of the output neurons that send signals down the spinal cord, the relationship between the activity of the output neurons and arm movements is unknown, and the arm has nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to measure. Furthermore, it is usually difficult to determine which recorded neurons are output neurons."
"One way to ease this difficulty is to use a BMI. Because of the way a BMI is constructed, only those neurons that are recorded can directly affect the movement of the cursor or robotic limb. Neurons throughout the brain are still involved, but they can influence the cursor movements only indirectly through the recorded neurons."
"Thus, in contrast to arm and eye movement studies, one can record from the entire set of output neurons in a BMI, and BMI-directed movements can be causally attributed to specific changes in the activity of the recorded neurons. Furthermore, the mapping between the activity of the recorded neurons and cursor movement is defined by the experimenter, so it is fully known. This mapping can be defined to be simple and can be easily altered by the experimenter during an experiment."
"In essence, a BMI defines a simplified sensorimotor loop, whose components are more concretely defined and more easily manipulated than for arm or eye movements. These advantages of BMIs allow for studies of brain function that are currently difficult to perform using arm or eye movements. For example, one class of studies involves using BMIs to study how the brain learns."
"The BMI mapping defines which population activity patterns will allow the subject to successfully move the BMI-directed cursor to hit visual targets. By defining the BMI mapping appropriately, the experimenter can challenge the subject’s brain to produce novel neural activity patterns. A recent study explored what types of activity patterns are easier and more difficult for the brain to generate."
They found that it was easier for subjects to learn new associations between existing activity patterns and cursor movements than to generate novel activity patterns. This finding has implications for our ability to learn everyday skills. A second class of studies involves asking how the activity of neurons that directly control movement differ from those that do not directly control movement.
"In a BMI, one can choose to use only a subset of the recorded neurons  for controlling movements. At the same time, other neurons  can be passively monitored without being used for controlling movements. Comparing the activity of output and nonoutput neurons can provide insight into how a network of neurons internally processes information and relays only some of that information to other networks."
"Using this paradigm, a recent study recorded neural activity simultaneously in the primary cortex and striatum and designated a subset of the M1 neurons as the output neurons for controlling the BMI. They found that, during BMI learning, M1 neurons that were most relevant for behavior  preferentially increased their coordination with the striatum, which is known to play an important role during natural behavior . Identifying output versus nonoutput neurons in a study using arm or eye movements would be challenging."
"A growing number of biomedical ethics considerations centered on the brain have arisen from the dramatic expansion in our understanding of neuroscience and our capabilities with neurotechnology. These advances are driven by society’s curiosity about the functioning of the brain, the least-well understood organ in the body, as well as the desire to address the massive unmet need of those suffering from neurological disease and injury. The use of BMIs raises new ethical questions for four principal reasons."
"First, recording high-fidelity signals  involves risk, including the risks associated with initial implantation of the electrodes as well as possible biological  responses during the lifetime of the electrodes and the associated implanted electronics. Electrodes implanted for long periods currently have functional lifetimes on the order of many months to a few years, during which time glial scar tissue can form around the electrodes and electrode materials can fail. Efforts to increase the functional lifetime of electrodes range from nanoscale flexible electrodes made with new materials to mitigating immunological responses, as is done with cardiac stents."
"For these reasons, patients considering receiving implanted recording technologies will need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a BMI, as is the case for all medical interventions. It is important for patients to have options, as each person has personal preferences involving willingness to undergo surgery, desire for functional restoration and outcome, and cosmesis—be it while deliberating cancer treatment or BMI treatment. BMIs based on different neural sensors  have different risks and benefits."
"Second, because BMIs can read out movement information from the brain at fine temporal resolution, it seems plausible that they will be able to read out more personal and private types of information as well. Future neuroethics questions that may arise as the technology becomes more sophisticated include whether it is acceptable, even with patient consent, to read out memories that may otherwise be lost to Alzheimer disease; promote long-term memory consolidation by recording fleeting short-term memories and playing them back directly into the brain; read out subconscious fears or emotional states to assist desensitization psychotherapy; or read out potential intended movements, including speech, that would not naturally be enacted. Third, intracortical write-in BMIs, similar to DBS systems currently used to reduce tremor, may one day evoke naturalistic spatial-temporal activity patterns across large populations of neurons."
"In the extreme it may not be possible for a person to distinguish self-produced and volitional neural activity patterns from artificial or surrogate patterns. Although there are numerous therapeutic and beneficial reasons for embracing this technology, such as reducing tremor or averting an epileptic seizure, more dubious uses can be envisioned such as commandeering a person’s motor, sensory, decision making, or emotional valence circuits. Finally, ethical questions also involve the limits within which BMIs should operate."
"Current BMIs focus on restoring lost function, but it is possible for BMIs to be made to enhance function beyond natural levels. This is as familiar as prescribing a pair of glasses that confer better than normal vision, or overprescribing a pain medication, which can cause euphoria that is often addictive. Should BMIs be allowed, if and when it becomes technically possible,  to move a robotic arm faster and more accurately than a native arm?"
"Should continuous neural recordings from BMIs, covering hours, days, or weeks, be saved for future analysis, and are the security and privacy issues the same or different from personal genomics data? Should BMIs with preset content be available for purchase, for example, to skip a grade of mathematics in high school? Should an able-bodied person be able to elect to receive an implanted motor BMI?"
"While the safe and ethical limits of such sensory, motor, and cognitive BMI treatments might seem readily apparent, society continues to wrestle with these same questions concerning other currently available medical treatments. These include steroids that enhance musculature, energy drinks  that enhance alertness, and elective plastic surgery that alters appearance. Although many of these ideas and questions may appear far-fetched at present, as mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction continue to be revealed, BMI systems could build on these discoveries and create even more daunting ethical quandaries."
"But equally important is the immediate need to help people suffering from profound neurological disease and injury through restorative BMIs. In order to achieve the right balance, it is imperative that physicians, scientists, and engineers proceed in close conversation and partnership with ethicists, government oversight agencies, and patient advocacy groups. 1."
"Brain–machine interfaces  are medical devices that read out and/or alter electrophysiological activity at the level of populations of neurons. BMIs can help to restore lost sensory, motor, or brain processing capabilities, as well as regulate pathological neural activity. 2."
BMIs can help to restore lost sensory capabilities by stimulating neurons to convey sensory information to the brain. Examples include cochlear implants to restore audition or retinal prostheses to restore vision. 3.
"BMIs can help to restore lost motor capabilities by measuring the activity from many individual neurons, converting this neural information into control signals, and guiding a paralyzed limb, robotic limb, or computer cursor. 4. Whereas motor BMIs aim to provide control of a robotic limb or paralyzed limb, communication BMIs aim to provide a fast and accurate interface with a computer or other electronic devices."
"5. BMIs can help to regulate pathological neural activity by measuring neural activity, processing the neural activity, and subsequently stimulating neurons. Examples include deep brain stimulators and antiseizure systems."
"6. Neural signals can be measured using different technologies, including electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical electrodes. Intracortical electrodes record the activity of neurons near the electrode tip and can also be used to deliver electrical stimulation."
"7. To study movement encoding, one usually considers the activity of an individual neuron across many experimental trials. In contrast, for movement decoding, one needs to consider the activity of many neurons across an individual experimental trial."
"8. A discrete decoder estimates one of several possible movement goals from neural population activity. In contrast, a continuous decoder estimates the moment-by-moment details of a movement from neural population activity."
"9. The field is making substantial progress in increasing the performance of BMIs, measured in terms of the speed and accuracy of the estimated movements. It is now possible to move a computer cursor in a way that approaches the speed and accuracy of arm movements."
"10. In addition to controlling computer cursors, BMIs can also guide a robotic limb or a paralyzed limb using functional electrical stimulation. Developments from preclinical experiments with ablebodied, nonhuman primates have subsequently been tested in clinical trials with paralyzed people."
"11. Future advances of BMI will depend, in part, on developments in neurotechnology. These include advances in hardware , software , and statistical methods ."
"12. An important direction for improving BMI performance is to provide the user with additional forms of sensory feedback in addition to visual feedback. An area of current investigation uses stimulation of neurons to provide surrogate sensory feedback, representing somatosensation and proprioception, during ongoing use."
"13. Beyond helping paralyzed patients and amputees, BMI is being increasingly used as a tool for understanding brain function. BMIs simplify the brain’s input and output interfaces and allow the experimenter to define a causal relationship between neural activity and movement."
"14. BMIs raise new neuroethics questions, which need to be considered together with the benefits provided by BMIs to people with injury or disease. From time immemorial, the more philosophical among us have pondered: “What is the essence of who I am?"
"What is it that has made me who I am? ” Behavioral biology is the science of trying to figure this out, with the guiding assumption that an understanding of who and why we are cannot be achieved without considering our biology. Now, a human asking these sorts of questions is more complicated, for a myriad of reasons, than a wildebeest asking, “Why is it in my essence to ovulate during one short period of time each year?"
"” or a migratory bird wondering, “Why is it that each year I wish to fly from Tierra del Fuego to Alaska? ” Tackling the biology of behavior is particularly daunting when considering humans and their social behaviors. These challenges are even more extreme when considering an aspect of our behavior that is often the most interesting and important to study: What is the behavioral biology of our abnormal human behaviors?"
"Because of the intrinsic intellectual challenge of a subject such as this, and because of its implication, when we ask a question about the biology of abnormal human behavior, we are often, de facto, asking: Whose fault is it that this has occurred; who should be held accountable? Multiple murderer: damaged frontal cortex or tainted soul? Spouse unable to get out of bed or go to work: victim of the neurochemistry of depression or self-indulgent slacker?"
"Child failing at school: learning disabled or lazy? This course is an introduction to the biology of human behavior, often of abnormal human behavior, with an emphasis on the brain. The purpose of the course is twofold: first, to teach the contemporary science of how our brains regulate our thoughts, emotions, and feelings—how our brains make us the individuals that we are—and second, to teach how our brains are regulated—sculpted by evolution, constrained or freed by genes, shaped  by early experience, modulated by hormones."
"In this framework, the view is not of the brain as the be-all and end-all of what makes us individuals but, rather, the brain as the final common pathway, the conduit by which our individuality is shaped by biology that started anywhere from seconds to millions of years ago. After an introductory lecture presenting this framework, a quarter of the course  will be devoted to the functions of the nervous system. These lectures are updated versions of those in the first edition of this Teaching Company course and will start at the level of how a single neuron functions, building upward until we examine how millions of neurons in a particular region of the brain operate."
"The focus will be on the regions of the brain most pertinent to emotion and behavior, rather than, say, to regulation of kidney function. The middle portion of the course  will explore how the brain and behavior are regulated. First, we will cover how the brain regulates hormones and how hormones influence brain function and behavior."
"Then, we will examine how both the brain and behavior evolved, covering contemporary thinking about how natural selection has sculpted and optimized behavior and how that optimization is mediated by brain function. We will then focus on a bridge between evolution and the brain, namely, what genes at the molecular level have to do with brain function and how those genes have evolved. Hormones, evolution, genes, and behavior, however, do not work in vacuo but, instead, are extremely sensitive to environment."
"The next section of the course  examines ethology, which is the study of the behavior of animals in their natural habitats . With these various approaches in hand, the final quarter of the course  will examine how each approach helps explain an actual set of behaviors. Among a number of possible topics, we will focus on aggression, both because of the extensive information available and the importance of the subject."
"The facts of this subject are not intrinsically difficult, even for the nonscientist. The implications, however, should seem far from simple. Yet this is a subject that each of us must master, because all of us are, de facto, behavioral biologists."
"We serve on juries, deciding whom to incarcerate, whom to put to death. We vote for elected officials who have stances regarding gun control and whether violence is inevitable, who determine whether certain types of love between consenting adults should be consecrated by the government imprimatur of marriage, who help decide whether a certain social problem can be fixed by government expenditures or is biologically irrevocable. And many of us will have to be behavioral biologists when confronting loved ones whose behaviors have changed them to an unrecognizable extent and deciding whether it is “them” or “their disease."
"” The final lecture of this course will consider issues such as these: What are the societal and philosophical consequences of knowledge about the biology of our behaviors, the biology of what makes us the individuals that we are? What do we do about the fact that recently scientists have figured out a way to change the brain chemistry of a male rodent and turn him from being polygamous into monogamous? It’s not clear if this counts as an intervention, or if this counts as a therapeutic sort of issue that we should be trying in our human males."
"The purpose of this course is to explain the biology of what makes us who we are, the biology of our individual differences, the biology of our behaviors. This introductory lecture presents the framework of the course: that there is a neurobiology of who we are, that it is vital to learn about it, and that it can best be understood with the interdisciplinary approach of this course. Throughout the subsequent sections, the constant themes will be the interactions of the various disciplines in their effects upon the brain and how all this helps us to understand individual behavioral differences."
"Biology must be considered as a possible factor in human behavior and individuality. Examples of changes of behavior in two adult males illustrate this factor. Chuck has always been an extrovert—charismatic, confident, and flirtatious."
"Recently, though, he has been getting more introverted and more withdrawn. Arthur, on the other hand, has always been obsessive, rigidly ethical, and extremely reliable at work. But recently, he has started to tell inappropriate sexual jokes, and he has even taken to stalking women."
"Could such changes of behavior, often explained as a midlife crisis, actually be the result of a mutation in a single gene? In these two cases, the answer is yes. There is a biology to our sexual choices, the extent and type of our religiosity, and everything else about us."
"How do we tend to approach the challenge of understanding our behavior? Typically, we think categorically, as with colors, coming up with labels and explanations, but categorical thinking has its advantages and its limits. Categorical thinking helps our memory, but categorical boundaries distort our ability to see the differences and similarities between two different facts."
"If you pay too much attention to the boundaries, you have trouble seeing the big picture. This course’s goal of noncategorical thinking about behavior is critical. Little can be explained by merely thinking about genes alone, or brain  chemicals, or hormones, or early experience, or any other single factor."
"Our blueprint for the entire course is to start off looking at what a behavior is in a particular category and a particular class, then to begin to ask biologically, where did that behavior come from? We start off by studying the brain and the nervous system. Beginning to work back in time, we then try to understand further the things that modulate the nervous system, such as environmental triggers, hormones, and perinatal and fetal development."
"Then working further back, we look at the genetic attributes of the population that an individual comes from. This approach pushes us all the way back to examine what the pressures are of natural selection that sculpted that species. Isn’t this approach obvious to everyone?"
"Perhaps it is now, but in the nottoo-distant past, many prominent scientists in this field were unable to think of the biology of our behavior in such a subtle way and, thus, often became damaging ideologues. What are the special challenges of thinking about the biology of behavior in humans versus behavior in other animals? In some ways, human behave just like any other animal, as with the synchronization of female reproductive cycles."
"In other ways, humans have a physiology very similar to that of other animals, but they utilize the physiology in unique ways. In still other ways, human behavior is utterly unique in the animal world, as with aspects of human sexual behavior for nonreproductive purposes. The general strategy for this course is to see how behavior can be understood in the context of everything from milliseconds of brain activity to millions of years of evolution."
"We start with how the brain works and how the brain produces behavior. We first study a single brain cell, a neuron, and then move on to understand how one neuron communicates with another. We work our way up to large networks of neurons, then to how the nervous system can regulate how all of our cells work."
"In the section on neurobiology, we will focus on two themes: first, understanding why one individual’s nervous system works differently from another’s and, second, understanding how this function can change over time . The subsequent lectures explore what it is that changes how the nervous system works, whether the environment, hormones, early experience, fetal life, genetics, or evolution. Finally, we approach a set of human behaviors with this set of strategic ideas, focusing on a contentious and important area of human behavior: aggression."
"This module, which covers the next three lectures, begins with an overview of how a single neuron works. This study will then be expanded to see how two neurons communicate with each other through the use of neurotransmitters—chemical messengers in the brain. Finally, there is an overview of the critical topic of how such intercellular communication can change over time, that is, how the brain, at the level of pairs of neurons, learns and changes in response to the environment."
"We want to understand behavior; we want to understand human behavior, where it’s coming from; we want to understand the biological basis of it and where all of those influences, starting with evolution a gazillion years ago are going to funnel eventually into the nervous system. This lecture covers the basic building blocks of neurobiology, beginning with an overview of the neuron, its various parts, and how each part functions and communicates with other neurons. The basic constituent of the nervous system is the brain cell."
"The main brain cell is the neuron. The other type of brain cell is the glial cell, which we will discuss later in this lecture. All neurons go from left to right, at least in diagrams."
"On the far left, we have the dendrites, the ears of the neuron, which create chemical excitation in the neuron. To the right of the dendrite is the cell body, the centerpiece of the cell, where energy is produced. A wave of chemical excitation passes from the dendritic end through the cell body down a long cable called the axon."
Axons are very long projections of neurons. The axon hillock is the transitional point between the end of the cell body and the start of the axon. At the end of the axon is the axon terminal that connects to the dendrites of the next neuron.
"Neuronal communication includes both resting potentials and action potentials. To be prepared to communicate clearly, neurons must concentrate on contrasts during resting potentials. In a state of equilibrium, neurons create chemical contrasts."
"Neurons expend a great deal of energy redistributing ions during the resting potentials. When new information is transmitted by a single dendritic spine, channels open and ions begin to move, causing a change in the electrical state of the neuron. No single neuronal input triggers an action potential; there is  not enough power for the flow of electrical information to continue."
Integration at the neuronal level occurs because of a process called summation. Temporal summation occurs when the same input is triggered over and over so that it finally moves down the axon. Spatial summation occurs when enough different dendritic spines are being stimulated at once so that information moves down the axon.
"A neuron cell body is an integrator of the inputs of all the different neurons around it. When there is enough of a wave of depolarization to reach the axon hillock, the axon hillock integrates the various inputs and decides whether or not to act. When the axon hillock is triggered to act, neurons are in action potential."
"Action potential does not decrement over space and time; it regenerates and continues passing information through the axon terminals to the next neurons. The axon hillock is a critical feature of the nervous system. 11 Glial cells, which were once thought to be unimportant, can wrap around the axon and form a myelin sheath."
"Myelin sheaths create an insulation that increases the speed with which electrical waves move down the axon. People are not born with myelin sheaths but develop them after birth. As myelin sheaths form, new skills are possible, including comprehension and production of language and regulation of behavior."
"Neurons are a complex, integrated network with interesting implications. The numbers of dendrites, neurons, and connectors vary from individual to individual and can change at different points of the life cycle because of environmental stimulation. Axon hillocks can also change over time and under different circumstances."
"These neurological differences and changes affect individuality. We are back and ready to resume our quest to understand the nervous system and how it produces behavior, and how everything on earth that came before that nervous system can regulate its function. This lecture moves from how the brain works on the level of a single neuron to how information moves across the synapse from one neuron to the next."
"Exploring how electrical signals are changed to chemical messages in the brain provides a critical foundation for understanding how the brain works, the effects of certain drugs on the brain, and the neurological origins of individuality. In order for information to move from one neuron to the next, information must cross the synapse. An electrical signal cannot pass through the synapse; thus, a neuron must translate its excitation into a different “language."
"” The release of neurotransmitters translates an electrical signal to a chemical signal. Neurotransmitters are packaged in vesicles attached to the membrane wall. During action potential, vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse."
The neurotransmitters bind to their receptors. The shape of the neurotransmitter and its receptor must be complementary— the classic notion of key and lock. The binding of the neurotransmitter to its receptor changes the excitability of the next neuron in line.
"Multiple receptor types exist for the same neurotransmitter. Upon deactivation, neurotransmitters either are recycled back into the next vesicle being formed or they float into the synapse, where they are eventually broken down by enzymes. There are multiple types of neurotransmitters and not all are excitatory."
"How many types of neurotransmitters exist? A limited number, but we have multiple uses of the same messenger. Inhibitory transmitters cause a decrease in excitability of the postsynaptic neuron."
Not all neurotransmitters are equal; there are subtle graduations of the effects among both the excitatory and inhibitory transmitters. The construction of neurotransmitters is less intimidating than you might think. They are constructed from cheap and plentiful precursors—simple amino acids that you get in your diet in huge amounts.
"A small number of biosynthetic steps are required in their construction; thus, they are produced quickly. Multiple messengers can be squeezed out of a single synthetic pathway. Neurotransmitters are also easily recycled."
What criteria are used to determine what constitutes a neurotransmitter? It is located in the axon terminal. It is released during the action potential.
It floats across the synapse and binds with receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Any interference with the neurotransmitter will alter the neurochemical events in a predictable manner. Changes in the amount of neurotransmitter released can change the strength of signaling across a synapse.
Changes in the number and sensitivity of receptors can change the strength of signaling across a synapse. Neuropharmacology manipulates the neurochemistry of the synapse to better understand the workings of the neurotransmission process. Research with drugs that alter brain function is an important tool for studying normal and diseased states.
"Some drugs so closely resemble a naturally occurring neurotransmitter that the receptors are fooled by it. An ingested drug can get into the bloodstream, enter the brain, get into a synapse, and very effectively bind to the receptor because that drug has a chemical structure almost identical to that of an actual neurotransmitter. For example, hallucinogens, such as LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin, are able to artificially stimulate the serotonin receptor."
"Other drugs block the access of a neurotransmitter to its receptor, halting communication across the synapse. Curare can block the acetylcholine receptor in the diaphragm, causing breathing to cease. Antipsychotic drugs can block the dopamine receptor, lessening symptoms of schizophrenia."
"Some drugs cause the inappropriate release of neurotransmitters. Amphetamines and cocaine trigger the premature release of dopamine transmitters. Because the release of dopamine makes a person feel pleasure in at least one part of the brain, artificially releasing more of it makes such drugs as cocaine highly addictive."
"Drugs that release dopamine can trigger schizophrenic behavior, while drugs that block dopamine are used to halt schizophrenic behavior. Drugs can also alter the breakdown and recycling of neurotransmitters or can be used to destroy particular neurotransmitters completely. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine can be destroyed to lower blood pressure."
"Antidepressants, including Prozac, cause amplification in the neurotransmitter’s signal by blocking its degradation. Another manipulation is to increase the amount of precursors for certain neurotransmitters, for example, increasing the L-DOPA level for patients with Parkinson’s disease. Manipulation of chemicals always has the risk of side effects, primarily because each neurotransmitter has multiple jobs in different parts of the brain."
"An example of how neurochemistry influences individuality can be seen in the neurotransmitter endogenous benzodiazepine, which is a compound similar to the drugs Valium and Librium. Endogenous benzodiazepine receptors influence anxiety levels. How much benzodiazepine an individual makes, releases, and breaks down will determine his or her anxiety level."
"Tranquilizers, such as Valium and Librium, are used to decrease a person’s anxiety level. Now our theme has been at the end of each lecture, twofold: one is looking at plasticity, how things change over time, individual differences, and when it comes to plasticity in the synapse, how it functions differently in response to experience. That’s such an important topic that gets an entire lecture today."
"Changing the strength of synaptic communication is the basis for learning. The dominant paradigm is that learning is the process of making certain pathways work more readily than they did before. In earlier times, it was believed that whenever something new was learned, a new neuron or a new synapse was formed; this may actually be true."
The cortex and hippocampus are the main regions of the brain responsible for learning and memory. Problems in the hippocampus may result in such diseases as Alzheimer’s disease. The famous case of H.
"M. , who had his hippocampus removed, shows the importance of the hippocampus to memory. Long-term potentiation , a synaptic model for learning, is the process of stimulating a dendritic spine in a dense cluster of rapid action potentials, resulting in that synapse becoming hyperresponsive or potentiated."
"After potentiation has occurred, the pathway is stronger. Potentiation increases the likelihood that a single neuron can cause an action potential. These changes are long lasting."
How does the initial phase of LTP work? LTP is the result of glutamate being released into synapses throughout the hippocampus. Glutamate is a simple neurotransmitter made from an amino acid.
"Glutamate is the most excitatory neuron with two receptor systems, each of which is differentially excitable. The workings of the two receptors explain the “Ah ha!” of learning. With repeated stimulation, enough glutamate is dumped into the synapses to open the second receptor, which allows a wave of excitatory calcium to pour in, causing great potentiation."
"How does LTP become long term? As LTP occurs, calcium enters the neuron. Calcium triggers an increase in the number of glutamate receptors in the relevant dendritic spine."
"Calcium causes the receptors to stay open and activated longer once they are excited. Calcium changes how readily the electrical wave spreads once there is some excitation. Once calcium rushes in, it causes the synthesis of a neurotransmitter that floats back to the presynaptic neuron."
"These retrograde neurotransmitters increase the amount of glutamate being synthesized by the presynaptic neuron. Some of these new transmitters are made from gases and, therefore, do not need vesicles. The vulnerability of glutamatergic pathways to neurological insults is relevant to a number of neurological diseases and disorders."
"If glutamate levels get too high , the postsynaptic neuron can be excited to death. This condition can occur in stroke, seizure, and cardiac arrest. Monosodium glutamate  and other dietary constituents that resemble glutamate may be worth worrying about."
"How do you forget anything? This is an important topic in the field of neurobiology, and it is still under study. In some manner, however, forgetting is thought to be a reversal of all the steps that we have just covered regarding LTP."
Several factors influence how readily LTP occurs. Some factors are known to enhance LTP. Abundant energy—lots of glucose in your blood that translates into neurons with more energy—facilitates LTP.
"Short-term stress  causes stress hormones to be released on a short-term basis, and these hormones enhance memory. Some factors are known to disrupt LTP. Energy depletion makes LTP less likely to occur."
"When you run out of energy, the whole transport of neurotransmitters is disrupted. Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, disturbs many types of memory consolidation and memory retrieval. Alcohol in sufficient amounts dramatically disrupts LTP."
"Individual differences in the area of LTP can manifest themselves in a number of ways. The amount and functions of neurotransmitters, receptors, and so on can vary greatly from person to person. An experiment at Princeton provides an interesting view on this subject."
"Scientists at Princeton developed Doogie mice, genetically engineered rodents that had better than average LTP and demonstrated better than average learning. Then, the scientists developed their less heralded cousins, mice with an impaired capacity for LTP and learning. They then raised the impaired mice in an extremely stimulating environment, which overcame their deficit."
This experiment shows that even something as seemingly deterministic as a major genetic defect can still be subject to important environmental modulation. Module Scope: This portion of the course expands the scale beyond that of cellular neurobiology to look at the functioning of networks of neurons. Lecture 5 is an introduction to the computational potential of neuronal networks.
"Lecture 6 is an examination of how millions of neurons—entire subregions of the brain—function. That lecture will specifically focus on the part of the brain called the limbic system, which is vitally concerned with emotion. Finally, Lecture 7 examines how the limbic system regulates the function of the body by way of the autonomic nervous system."
"We are now accomplishing this ever-expanding view of how the nervous system works. The brain consists of networks of neurons. It has far more than patterns of single neurons in line, instead, neurons send axons to many other neurons, sending branches off, even back to themselves, forming networks."
Neurons sharpen the detection of signals by inhibiting themselves and other neurons. Neurons communicate with themselves. The ability of neurons to have projections coming off the axon and sending projections back onto themselves allows them to inhibit themselves and sharpen their signals over time.
"This communication creates individual action potentials, followed by resting potentials. Recurrent collateral projections are seen in many neurons. Through lateral inhibition, neurons sharpen their signals over space."
The excitation of one neuron leads to the delayed inhibition of other neurons. This lateral inhibition helps to enhance the precise localization of information. The work of Hubel and Wiesel helped to explain the wiring of neural networks.
"By studying how each section of the cortex processed visual information, they were able to show that each layer of the cortex became increasingly sophisticated. Point-for-point mapping at the first layer indicated that these neurons “know” about dots of light. The neurons in the second layer of the cortex “know” about straight lines of light."
"The neurons in the third layer of the cortex “know” about moving lines, while the neurons in the fourth layer “know” about angles. Following this logic, it was believed that one could continue through the layers and find more super-specialized neurons that recognize more specific information. This finding was not possible because there could not possibly be enough neurons for each to contain a single piece of information."
It is not single neurons that contain information but patterns of neuronal excitation. A neural network is a series of neurons that interact among themselves and with neurons from other networks. Neurons from different networks can overlap and be used in different settings.
"Memory retrieval is the result of tapping into many networks and integrating all those inputs. Mild neuron loss, including that associated with earlystage dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, does not destroy memories as much as it makes it harder to retrieve memory. Neural networks also influence how the human body feels and responds to pain."
"In instances of sharp pain, the neurons directly affected “turn on” pain, and through inhibition, the pain is “turned off. ” In instances of dull pain, those neurons directly affected “turn on” pain; however, the lack of self-inhibition causes the throbbing to continue. It is the individual differences that exist in the overlapping projections of networks that cause people to know different information and to make different connections with that information."
"That is what creativity is about. On a simplistic level, creative people have broader networks than most other people, resulting in their ability to make unique associations. Increasing the scale beyond that of single neural networks, this lecture examines the limbic system—the part of the brain most centrally involved in emotion and in generation of emotionally related behavior."
"The brain is not one homogenous mass of undifferentiated neurons. Instead, there is structure and organization to it. Clusters of neuronal cell bodies, called gray matter, are the nuclei of cell bodies."
"Cables of axons are projections from those cell bodies. They are called white matter because they are wrapped in white myelin sheaths. Now, we expand one step further to the neuroanatomy of the brain."
"First, we see the broad features of the mammalian brain. Heading down from the brain are the spinal cord, sensory afferents, and motor efferents, all of which carry sensory information and messages to all parts of the body. At the back of the brain are the hindbrain and brainstem, which control such activities as breathing and the beating of the heart."
"Sitting on top of the hindbrain and brainstem is the limbic system, which deals with regulation of emotions. Higher up is the cortex, involved in memory, learning, judgment, decision making, conscious commands to muscles, and complex processing of sensory information. Species differences in neuroanatomical organization must be noted."
"The limbic system is a mammalian specialty; only mammals have complex emotions. The cortex, which is involved in social intelligence, is a primate specialty. What is the limbic system?"
"Historically, people used to think that the limbic system was the rhinencephalon, or “nose-brain,” because it was studied first in laboratory rats, for which olfaction and emotion are utterly intertwined. The limbic system comprises many different subareas. These subareas send projections to one another and to other parts of the brain, particularly to the hypothalamus."
"All of the brain nuclei in the limbic system want to influence the hypothalamus. Conversely, these nuclei want to inhibit other limbic sites from influencing the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls all manner of autonomic  functions in your body."
"Future lectures will address the hypothalamus in more detail. The best way to determine which limbic structure influences the hypothalamus most readily is to count synapse numbers. The fewer synapses it takes to get from one limbic structure to the hypothalamus, the more influential that structure is over the hypothalamus."
"Components of the limbic system include major structures, as well as major connections within the system. Major structures within the limbic system include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the septum, the cingulate cortex and gyrus, the hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the thalamic nuclei, and the frontal cortex. Major connections within the limbic system include the amygdalofugal pathway ; the fimbria/fornix ; the striae terminalis ; the medial forebrain bundle ; and the mammillothalamic tract ."
How do we know what the limbic system does? Scientists come to understand what the limbic system does in the same ways that they discover how any brain region works. One way is to experimentally damage the part of the brain to be studied in research animals.
Accidental wounds to the human brain can  provide similar information. Other strategies are to stimulate certain parts of the brain or to record the electrical activity of certain clusters of neurons. A relatively new method is brain imaging.
"A more classical approach is neuroanatomy: determining which region talks to which. Some pitfalls of these approaches include redundancy, compensation, and mistaking the function of a nucleus for the function of the fibers passing through it. Studying limbic function poses special challenges because this area of the brain deals with complex, subtle, interactive emotions; therefore, many factors must be kept in mind."
"What sort of sensory information is relevant in a particular species? For example, sexual arousal in one species can be about smell and in another, about sight. What does a behavior look like in a particular species?"
"For example, maternal behavior in a rat is very different from that in a monkey. Who is the individual under study? Do dominant and subordinate animals express emotions in the same way?"
"Simplified explanations of some functions for limbic structures are helpful to further understand the brain and behavior. The amygdala and septum have roles in aggression. The hippocampus is important in certain types of learning, memory, and stress-responsiveness."
Mammillary bodies are associated with maternal behavior. The frontal cortex controls inhibition of socially inappropriate behaviors and inhibition of perseverative cognitions. The medial preoptic region of the hypothalamus is associated with sexual behavior.
"The lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus affect hunger and satiation. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is involved in circadian rhythmicity. Although the heart is able to beat on its own, the brain tells it whether to speed up or slow down."
"Let’s start with the basics of the Autonomic Nervous System . The voluntary nervous system controls the rapid regulation of skeletal muscles. In contrast, the ANS regulates involuntary function throughout the body."
"The ANS has two components. The sympathetic nervous system , which releases epinephrine and norepinephrine , is used for emergencies. The parasympathetic nervous system  releases acetylcholine, which triggers a calm, vegetative state."
"The SNS and PNS work in choreographed opposition in all parts of the body. Although the heart is able to beat on its own, the brain tells it whether to speed up or slow down. The SNS causes the heart to beat faster and blood pressure to increase, all as a strategy to deliver energy to exercising muscle."
"The PNS does the opposite, slowing down the heart. SNS 31 and PNS also interact during digestion. Under normal circumstances, the PNS stimulates the digestive tract."
"During an emergency, the SNS has the opposite effects. It shuts down digestion and blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract to ensure that energy is not wasted there. The SNS and PNS work in a more coordinated fashion when a male becomes aroused."
"In order for the penis of a male to become erect, the PNS must be activated and, thus, requires that he be in a calm state. The SNS, however, slowly takes over, and when the PNS is turned off, ejaculation occurs. Syndromes of erectile dysfunction include stress-induced erectile dysfunction, during which stress prevents a man from attaining a state of calm and, thus, an erection, and premature ejaculation, during which the transition from PNS to SNS occurs more quickly than desired."
Both are disorders of the choreography between the PNS and SNS. The ANS is activated and regulated differently in three layers of the brain. The first regulation of the ANS is directly influenced by the hypothalamus.
"For example, if a person is injured and his or her blood pressure is dropping, a blood pressure sensor sends a message up the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, which stimulates the SNS, increasing blood pressure and  heart rate. In the second layer, the ANS is regulated by the limbic system. For example, the scent or the sight of a threatening rival is detected, causing an emotional response and sending a message to the hypothalamus, which in turn, activates the ANS."
"In the third layer, we have cortical regulation of the ANS in a way that is fairly unique to primates. Cortical projections are sent to the limbic system, including the hypothalamus, to activate the ANS. Thought and memory serve as stimulants of the ANS."
"This method of activation gives us insight into the cause of clinical depression. On a certain level, depression can be thought of as the cortex sending abstractly depressive thoughts into limbic and hypothalamic regions, resulting in the affect of depression . A clinically depressed person feels grief, exhaustion, and an absence of pleasure, called anhedonia."
Plasticity in ANS function over time manifests itself in three ways. Habituation is the process whereby the same stimulus will not have the same effect on the ANS. Sensitization is the process whereby a stimulus that once did not have an effect on the ANS now does.
"Biofeedback is a conscious tool for controlling the unconscious workings of the ANS; for example, thinking relaxing thoughts can reduce the SNS response. Individual differences in ANS function explain why some of us are more vulnerable to depression or anxiety disorders than others. The lectures on the brain ended with an overview of how the brain  regulates the body by way of the ANS."
"Starting with Lecture 8, this module first examines how the limbic system also regulates the body through the release of hormones. Following that is a review of the different types of hormones and what sort of effects they have. Lecture 9 considers the converse of the brain’s regulation of hormones, namely, the hormones’ regulation of the brain."
"How can hormones change the function and even the very structure of the brain? The main point of these lectures is to refute the notion that hormones “cause” behaviors to occur  and, instead, to explain how hormones interact with the nervous system to change the likelihood of behaviors occurring in certain environments. I’ve changed my shirt since the last lecture and thus feel wildly invigorated, and that’s a great thing because we are talking hormones today."
"What is the difference between a neurotransmitter and a hormone? Neurotransmitters travel across synapses and influence the next neuron in line, while hormones travel in the bloodstream. There are three other major differences between neurons and hormones."
Hormones work more slowly than neurotransmitters. Neurons communicate only with neurons; hormones influence every cell in the body and can be secreted from various parts of the body. Hormones have a broader effect on cells.
"The brain plays a critical role in regulating the endocrine systems. The hypothalamus is the center of the endocrine world, and the limbic system tries to tell the hypothalamus what to do. The earlier view was that peripheral glands were autonomous and self-regulating."
"This notion then gave way to the equally incorrect idea that the pituitary was the “master gland. ” It is understood now that the brain is an endocrine gland and that the hypothalamus secretes an array of hormones, which in turn, regulate the pituitary gland. 35 The anterior pituitary is a hormonal system that is entirely under the control of the brain."
"The hypothalamus releases hormones to stimulate or inhibit the pituitary gland cells. The anterior pituitary, in turn, regulates hormonal release from peripheral glands. The posterior pituitary is another hormonal system that is entirely under the control of the brain."
"The posterior pituitary can be considered an outpost of the brain. The posterior pituitary releases oxytocin and vasopressin, hormones that play roles in birth and lactation. The body also has hormonal systems that are under partial control by the brain."
"One example is the pancreas, which produces a number of hormones, the most recognized of which is insulin. Insulin secretion is triggered by blood glucose, and it is also triggered through the PNS by the expectation of food. Hormonal systems in the body that The body also has hormonal systems that are independent of the brain."
"In such cases, hormones are derived from all sorts of unlikely sources, such as the heart and the immune system. When the heart senses high blood pressure, it releases a hormone, ANF, to the kidneys to tell them to make more urine, thereby reducing the amount of fluid in circulation; as a result, blood volume is reduced and blood pressure is lowered. The immune system also has messengers that act as hormones."
"One of them, Interleukin 1, triggers white blood cells to proliferate and mount an immune defense against a pathogen that the system has detected. Interleukin 1 can also affect brain function, bringing about fatigue or fever and making one’s body ache by sensitizing pain pathways, and it can trigger a stress response. All these events are ways to make a person decrease activity during illness."
"There are two broad classes of hormones. Steroid hormones include estrogens, androgens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. The other class of hormones is made from amino acids; that is, they are protein based."
"They include insulin, follicle-stimulating hormone , and growth hormone. For both classes, we see the themes of cheap and plentiful starting material, short synthetic pathways, and multiple messengers derived from the same precursors. But cheap messengers require very fancy and expensive receptors to tell apart these structurally similar hormones."
"Hormone receptors are as critical to the endocrine system as the hormones they receive. Hormones bind to receptors and, thereby, activate events in cells. Amino acid-derived hormones tend to influence the activity of proteins that already exist in the cell ."
"Steroid hormones tend to alter the synthesis of new proteins. The amount of a hormone in the bloodstream is important, but so are the amount and function and possible mutation of hormone receptors. A great deal of crosstalk exists between different endocrine systems."
An example of such crosstalk is seen in the effects of stress on female reproduction. The ovarian axis illustrates the pathway. The hypothalamus releases the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone .
"The LHRH causes the anterior pituitary to release the luteinizing hormone. The ovaries are then triggered to release estrogen, causing the uterine wall to mature. If you add any major form of stress, such as starvation or psychological trauma, stress hormones will influence every step in that pathway."
"Stress and its effects on hormone release from fat cells show that starvation is an antireproductive form of stress. Likewise, excessive amounts Hormone receptors are as critical to the endocrine system as the hormones they receive. Hormones bind to receptors and, thereby, activate events in cells."
"37 of exercise can cause the release of beta-endorphins, which, along with other stress hormones, can also have antireproductive effects. Stress-induced release of prolactin disrupts uterine maturation. What we do in this lecture is one of the things that science often does, which is to complete a loop, show a big, old regulatory loop."
"Now looking at not how the brain regulates hormones, but how hormones in the circulation get back into the brain and regulate brain function. Hormones have effects on cells, including cells in the brain. Both neurons and glial cells have hormone receptors."
"Hormones can alter protein function and synthesis in the brain, just as they do throughout the rest of the body. Hormones can alter neurotransmitter actions in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter of pleasure in the brain."
"Steroid hormones called glucocorticoids are released during stress, and these hormones have an effect on dopamine release. During short-term stress , a transient rise in glucocorticoid levels occurs, resulting in increased synaptic release of dopamine. This can produce pleasurable effects."
"LTP is enhanced as well. During long-term stress, however, a chronic rise in glucocorticoid levels occurs; thus, the dopamine neurons are depleted, leading to anhedonia, or the inability to feel pleasure. Hormones can also alter the plasticity of synapses."
"Glucocorticoid levels affect the hippocampus and the amygdala differently. A transient rise in glucocorticoid levels in the hippocampus brought on by shortterm stress enhances LTP, while sustained glucocorticoid exposure in the hippocampus can disrupt LTP. On the other hand, chronic stress enhances LTP in the amygdala, thereby enhancing the ability of the amygdala to “file away” memories of trauma."
"This factor might explain free-floating anxiety, in which the hippocampus does not recall an explicit traumatic memory, but the amygdala recognizes the source of the trauma and activates the sympathetic  nervous system. Estrogen is another hormone that enhances LTP in the hippocampus. Hormones can change the structure of neural networks, causing neurons to grow more elaborate dendritic branches or to shrivel up."
"Chronic stress and the resulting chronic glucocorticoid exposure cause atrophy of hippocampal neurons, thus inhibiting learning. Chronic stress and the resulting chronic glucocorticoid exposure cause expansion of dendritic branches in the amygdala, thus increasing anxiety. Higher estrogen levels cause the growth of new dendritic branches in hippocampal neurons, thus enhancing learning and memory."
"Hormones can also affect the birth and death of neurons. The discovery of adult neurogenesis is an exciting new finding in neurobiology. Estrogen enhances the birth of new neurons in the adult brain, while glucocorticoids inhibit such neurogenesis."
"Estrogen makes neurons more likely to survive a neurological insult, while glucocorticoids do the opposite in response to such an insult. Hormones can influence how the brain regulates the body and behavior. For example, it used to be thought that glucose levels in the bloodstream alone controlled our appetites."
"Now it is known that an array of hormones released by the gastrointestinal tract, fat cells, liver, and pancreas regulate appetite. A theme that runs through behavioral neuroendocrinology is that hormones may “cause” some behaviors, such as aggression, to occur. Instead, however, hormones alter a preexisting tendency for the behavior to occur in the context of interaction with the environment."
"This notion will be studied more in depth in the lectures on aggression. This module is the first of a series that expands the focus of the course, examining how the brain is shaped and regulated. It considers the evolution of the brain and behavior."
"First, we review the mechanisms of evolution, then we look at how those mechanisms might be relevant to the evolution of behavior. In Lecture 11, we then consider a variety of initially puzzling examples of social behavior in the light of evolutionary principles. Finally, in Lecture 12, we review the evolution of competition and how the brain functions under different settings of competition."
"We all understand the evolutionary biology of how, for example, the giraffe evolved its long neck as an adaptive trait. This lecture introduces the idea that behavior and the brain that produces behavior have also evolved, sculpted toward adaptive features by natural selection. Then, the lecture provides an overview of the various ways in which species can maximize the number of copies of their genes passed on to the next generation through behavioral means."
"The evolutionary biology taught in high school was built around certain key points that help to explain such phenomena as how giraffes evolved long necks. The first key point is the inheritance of traits across generations; that is, traits can be passed on from one generation to the next. The second key point is the variability in those heritable traits among individuals."
"In modern genetic molecular terms, mutations in genes can be passed from one generation to the next. The third key point is known as differential fitness; that is, some versions of those genetic variants are more adaptive, more fit, than others. Organisms with maladaptive mutations do not reproduce; they do not survive, and therefore, they do not pass on copies of their genes."
"Organisms having beneficial mutations, however, do reproduce; thus, the new version of a trait becomes more plentiful. Intrinsic to this key point is the debunking of a great urban legend of evolution, which is survival of the fittest. Instead, the key is reproduction of the fittest."
"How did behavior evolve? The notion exists that behavior is sculpted by evolution, by the same forces of nature that influenced the length of our necks and the functioning of our hearts and kidneys. That notion leads, however, to the inflammatory issue of heritability of behavior: the issue of whether a certain behavior has a genetic component."
"Building block #1 in considering the evolution of behavior is individual selection. The old notion of group selection, that is, the idea that animals behave “for the good of the species” and that behaviors are driven by ways to increase the likelihood of the species surviving and multiplying, has been proven wildly incorrect. Instead, by the early 1960s, the concept of individual selection was accepted."
"This idea proposed that evolution is not about animals behaving for the good of the species but, rather, behaving to optimize the number of copies of their own genes to pass on to the next generation. This idea brought about the oversimplified and somewhat erroneous notion of the selfish gene: the idea that a gene’s purpose is to maximize one’s own ability to reproduce and to pass on copies of one’s own genes. Another way to illustrate this idea is a quote from an early evolutionist, Samuel Butler: “A chicken is just an egg’s way of making another egg."
"” A rather grim example of the logic of individual selection is competitive infanticide, as seen in a number of species, even those as endangered as the gorilla. Building block #2 in considering the evolution of behavior is kin selection . What does it mean to be related to someone?"
It means you share genes with that individual. Kin selection is a way to help your relatives reproduce as much as they can—passing on copies of your genes by helping relatives. Degrees of relatedness on a genetic level come into play here because we are “more related” to some individuals than others.
"For example, full siblings are closer genetically than half siblings; a parent is closer genetically to a child than is a grandparent. In short, the more steps away relatives are from one another, the fewer genes they share in common. One of the implications of kin selection is an obsession with kinship."
"For the most part, data support the logic that we are cooperative with relatives as a function of how related they are to us; hence the quote of evolutionary geneticist J. B. S."
"Haldane: “I will lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins. ” Some examples of kin selection in the animal world include adelphic polyandry, food sharing in inbred species, and parentoffspring conflict. Polyandry, in which a single female mates with more than one male, occurs fairly rarely in the animal kingdom and among humans."
"However, when it does occur, it is often adelphic polyandry, in which the males are brothers. Many studies show that the degree of relatedness is an accurate predictor of how much one animal shares food with another. Parent-offspring conflict stems from the idea that whereas a parent wants to balance the survival of current offspring with that of future offspring, those current offspring want more care than the parent cares to offer."
"For example, conflict may occur between a mother baboon who wishes to wean her year-old offspring so that she can ovulate and possibly produce another, while that young baboon wants to continue nursing. Building block #3 in considering the evolution of behavior is reciprocal altruism. This notion is based on the concept that many hands make the task light."
"Such cooperation ensures the distribution of risk- and food-sharing among hunters. Reciprocity is very common in all sorts of social species, even among nonrelatives. However, species that exhibit such patterns of cooperation must possess certain characteristics."
"Reciprocity will work only in a species with stable social groups. The species involved must live long How the nervous system regulates the body and how the body in turn, by way of hormones can regulate the nervous system. 45 enough to benefit from the cooperation."
"The members of the species must have enough social intelligence to recognize other members of their species. In games of reciprocal altruism, which we will discuss in Lecture 12, individuals will try to cheat whenever they can; thus, another requirement is vigilance against cheaters. Potential examples of reciprocal altruism include blood-sharing among vampire bats and coalitions among male baboons."
"How can we successfully predict the social structure of an entire species  based on just one fact? Imprinted genes and intersexual competition also play roles in evolutionary biology. Mendel theorized that a gene is a gene, regardless of which parent you inherited it from."
"Imprinted genes—genes that produce different outcomes in offspring depending on which parent they come from—have been discovered to be an exception to the laws of Mendelian heredity. For example, during fetal life, some male-derived genes push for more fetal growth, while female-derived genes favor the opposite. The logic of imprinted genesis is that in polygamous species, males and females have different investments in any given pregnancy."
"The male would like the female to expend all her energy raising his offspring, even at the expense of her ability to reproduce again. The female, however, wishes to balance her investment in her current offspring with her investment in her future reproductive potential. The effects of imprinted genes in the brain on behavior after birth provide a marked contrast, with male-derived genes favoring more feeding and growth and female-derived genes the opposite, trying to slow the growth down."
"Generally, polygamous species have large numbers of imprinted genes, whereas monogamous species have virtually none. Humans are neither a classic pair-bonding species nor a classic tournament species; we are somewhere in between. Therefore, we have some imprinted genes."
"Fruit flies and sperm competition also illustrate this intersexual competition. Numerous male fruit flies mate with the female; thus, sperm from many different males is inside the female fruit fly’s body. The male sperm release toxins in an effort to kill its competitors’ sperm."
"These toxins are damaging to the female fruit fly. However, female fruit flies’ bodies have evolved so that they now produce detoxifying defenses. Kin-based defense systems also illustrate the notion of kin selection."
"When female vervet monkey A attacks female vervet monkey B for “no reason,” the underlying cause for the attack can actually be that the child of monkey B had attacked the child of monkey A. Patterns of aggression that closely follow the lines of kin selection are another way to ensure that the maximum number of copies of one’s genes is passed on to the next generation. Last lecture was incredibly depressing."
"All I did was tell you that the modern viewpoint of evolutionary biology just selects for competition and National Enquirer headlines; that fruit fly poisons lover and nature is just bloody and tooth and claw. Where we pick up with today is the fact that that’s absolutely not the case. One of the three building blocks of evolutionary biology is reciprocal altruism or cooperation, which was covered in Lecture 10."
"Cooperation is evolutionarily desirable, improving conditions in many settings. The bigger advantage is gained, however, when the other individual cooperates while you cheat. However, if you both cheat, the outcome can be really bad."
"Thus, the question arises: When do you cooperate and when do you cheat? This question is at the heart of a relatively new field called game theory, which originated in the area of economics. Game theory applications to evolutionary biology are manifested in a game called the Prisoner’s Dilemma."
"Its basic design is one of cooperation or defection: Successfully cheating is more rewarding than mutually cooperating, which is more rewarding than no one cooperating, which is more rewarding than cooperating with a cheater. Economist Robert Axelrod’s famous roundrobin Prisoner’s Dilemma tournament led to the emergence of the tit-for-tat strategy: losing the battles but winning the war by being cooperative, clear, retributive, and forgiving. The vulnerability of the tit-for-tat strategy lies in signal errors, in other words, if communication between two sides is unclear."
"Forgiving tit-for-tat is a derived strategy that comes about when a mistake in communication is introduced into the system. After the wrong signal is given, a few rounds of cheating ensue, then one player “forgives,” and cooperation is reestablished. Establishing cooperation in such games as the Prisoner’s Dilemma can prove challenging."
"The problem exists of the disadvantage for the first player to make an altruistic gesture; that player will always be one step behind. One solution is kin selection in isolated, inbred populations. A small group that has become separated from a greater group tends to inbreed, with members becoming more related to each other; in this way, cooperation begins, initially driven mostly by kin selection."
"When that small group, called the founder population, later rejoins the main population, that nucleus of cooperators influences the rest of the population to cooperate. Another solution lies in repeated interactions with the same player and the shadow of the future. In this case, players realize that, although cheating may offer a short-term advantage, it is better to cooperate in view of future rounds because the tit-for-tat strategy is about losing battles but winning the war."
"Another variable to consider is open-book play and reputation; that is, the ability for players to see what another’s strategy has been in other games. Still another variable is the interspersing of multiple games, in which the level of cooperation in one game can influence the level of cooperation  in another, resulting in an equilibrium state of cooperation in both games. Punishment is another great impetus for cooperation."
"Cooperation emerges when punishment is allowed in single-round, closed-book games. Cooperation also flourishes when there is the potential for “altruistic punishment. ” That is, A does something bad to B, and C, as a disinterested outsider, punishes A for doing so."
"Taken one step further, secondary punishment is introduced, wherein both cheaters and anyone who knowingly fails to punish a cheater are punished. Honor codes at military schools and universities engender cooperation through the threat of such secondary punishment. Choice as to whom to play with out of a pool of potential partners enables players to select for cooperation."
"Choice as to whether you play or not is another option. Other games in the repertoire of game theory include Chicken, the Ultimatum Game, and the Battle of the Sexes. Intrinsic to all this behavior in games is something obvious to just about anyone: Humans do not always make rational economic choices; we are not rational in reciprocal altruistic interactions."
"Studying the evolution of reciprocity has culminated in the development of the field of neuroeconomics: imaging the brain during game playing and decision making. Some classic findings have come about from this imaging. The outcome in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game that is revealed through brain imaging to be the most powerful stimulus of the dopamine-releasing pleasure pathway is a surprise, to some, at least: cooperation between both players."
"In another scenario, when a choice must be made between a cheap, fast payoff and a much greater reward later, the frontal cortex, which plays a central role in gratification postponement and resistance of the temptation of a quick, small payoff, is shown to be more activated. The Runaway Trolley quandary in philosophy is another classic problem. You have two choices to save lives on a runaway trolley that is racing down a track about to hit and kill five people: Either you can pull a lever that will  divert the trolley to another track where it will kill only one person or you can push one large person onto the track and that will stop the trolley before it hits the five people."
"With either choice, you will kill one person to save five. We tend to make completely different decisions depending on the emotional salience of how a problem is presented. In this quandary, most people choose to pull the lever."
"When a person is contemplating pulling the lever, the frontal cortex activates. But when the person is contemplating pushing someone off the trolley to his death, the limbic system activates. Cortical versus limbic activation is identified, depending on the emotionality with which a problem is framed."
"Evolution is about changing frequencies of genes over time, and the first two lectures of this module focus on what genes actually are and what they do. Key points will be how genes evolve and what genes have to do with the brain and behavior. The latter two lectures will focus on what initially seems to be a simple question: How can you tell when a behavior has a genetic component?"
"As will be seen, this question is vastly difficult to answer. The main intellectual thrust of this section will be to teach how pointless the nature/nurture debate is when considering genes and the brain. The basic theme of the last three lectures has been understanding how this or that behavior has “evolved."
"” “Evolved” really implies changes in genes over time. And what do genes have to do with behavior? In studying what genes actually do, we must begin with the function and structure of proteins."
"Things we have encountered so far in the course that are made of protein include receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters, many neurotransmitters and hormones themselves, and the enzymes that make them and break them down. Proteins are made of a 20-letter alphabet of amino acids. Each of the 20 different amino acids has a different shape."
"When you string the amino acids together to form a protein, each protein has its own unique shape. The shape of a protein determines its function. Just think of the protein key  fitting into a protein lock ."
"Genes specify the amino acid sequence that determines the function of a protein. In the next step in studying what genes actually do, we must look at how the synthesis of proteins is directed. DNA is composed of long strings of a four-letter alphabet of molecules."
A combination of three of those DNA letters in a row codes for one of the amino acids. A string of those three-letter DNA codes in a row instructs the string of amino acids that are stuck together to form a particular protein. There are unique threeletter DNA codes that indicate the beginning and end of the DNA stretch that codes for a specific protein.
"The stretch of DNA that makes up the complete code for a single type of protein is called a gene. The human genome  contains about 30,000 genes. This 30,000-gene-long book of DNA can get cumbersome; for this reason, it is broken into separate volumes, called chromosomes."
"Finally, in studying what genes actually do, we come to the intervening step of RNA. A single copy of each book of DNA exists in each cell, stored in the nucleus. However, protein synthesis occurs in every far-flung corner of a cell."
"For convenience, when a gene is activated to direct the construction of 57 its cognate protein, an RNA “photocopy” of that gene is made and shipped to the part of the cell where that protein is needed. How do genes evolve? When a cell divides, a copy of all the DNA is made for the new cell."
"A mutation is an error in that copying, and when such an error occurs in an egg or sperm, it can be inherited. Deletion and insertion mutations are typically disasters, producing a nonfunctional protein. Point mutations can produce subtle changes in protein shape and, thus, protein function."
This is the grist of evolution. A receptor for some neurotransmitter becomes a little bit more or less responsive to the messenger than it used to be. An enzyme that synthesizes some hormone is a little more or less active than it used to be.
"And as we saw back in Lecture 3, one’s level of anxiety can be influenced by how well one’s benzodiazepine receptors work. From there, we can go back to Darwin and ask if a genetic change makes the organism more or less likely to reproduce. I assume you spent the break looking for your receipt to get reimbursed for this course; after all, the last lecture was nothing but shameless lies to you."
What we need to do is see what is actually going on. What do we know at this point? Continuous stretches of genes contain coding for different proteins.
"Mutations within genes change the function of the protein they produce. Genes, however, are not continuous in DNA. Introns are intervening sequences of DNA that break up genes into parts called exons."
"We can temporarily consider the intervening DNA, which accounts for 95 percent of all DNA, to be “junk. ” A whole protein is made out of this fragmented DNA code with splicing enzymes, that is, enzymes that cut out the intervening sequences and pull the protein together. Now we can explore the potential for macroevolutionary change."
"Previously, we saw evolution producing changes in function of  preexisting genes. Now, we come to evolution producing entirely new genes. If there is a mutation in a gene coding for a splicing enzyme, the result may be the generation of two different proteins, two different messengers from the same precursor."
Another route for macro-evolutionary change can be found in transposable genetic elements. The heresy and ultimate triumph of Barbara McClintock’s theory of “jumping genes” is an epic story. What sorts of species have lots of transposable genetic events?
"Species that can’t run away from stressors, such as plants. Parasites that are trying to evade an immune system. Immune systems that are trying to get those parasites."
"The consequence of a transposable genetic event in an egg or sperm is the potential for the inheritance of an entirely new gene. One last major complexity entails promoters and transcription factors that are the instructions for when genes are activated, when gene transcription should begin, and when the gene should start making an RNA copy and splicing. Now we need to revisit that noncoding  DNA that we temporarily called “junk."
"” Instead of being junk, that noncoding DNA often decides when a gene is turned on or off. Regulation of gene transcription requires promoters and transcription factors. Promoters are the switches that turn gene transcription on and off."
Transcription factors are proteins that throw those switches. What regulates transcription factors? The world within the cell but outside the nucleus can determine when a gene is turned on.
The world within the organism but outside the cell can activate a gene. The outside environment can trigger internal reactions that turn a gene on. The introduction of “if-then” clauses adds another dimension into gene regulation.
"Hypothetically, if you start with an established if-then clause  and add one mutational event, you have a new genetic if-then clause . Punctuated equilibrium is a theory that evolution actually involves long periods of stasis interspersed with periods of relatively rapid and dramatic changes. We must place genes in the context of environment."
"Genes no more give commands than do telephone books. You cannot understand genes without understanding their regulation by the environment, which makes “gene versus environment” or “nature versus nurture” debates meaningless. We also have to consider macroevolutionary changes in gene regulation."
What if you have a mutation in a promoter sequence? What if you have a transposable event in a promoter sequence? Evolution works faster on introns than on exons.
"Therefore, evolution is more about changes in the regulation of genes by the environment than about changes in genes themselves and the proteins  hey code for. A final point is that there are more genes whose expression is unique to the brain than to any other part of the body. First, let’s look at behavior genetics as a discipline."
"In Lectures 10– 12, we saw how an evolutionary biologist infers that something is “genetic. ” In Lectures 13 and 14, we learned how a molecular biologist infers that something is “genetic. ” In this lecture, we will see that a behavior geneticist infers that something is “genetic” by comparing patterns of shared behaviors and shared genes in a population."
"For starters, let’s look at everything we have learned so far and determine what it does not mean to say that a behavior is “genetic”: Genes are not deterministic; they do not inevitably cause some behavior; and they are not impervious to environment. Instead, genes can only support propensities or tendencies to a particular behavior. An initial simplistic approach is to say that genes run in families; thus, if a behavior runs in a family, it must be genetic."
"The flaw in that approach is that environment runs in families as well. A slightly less simplistic approach theorizes that close relatives share more genes in common than distant relatives; thus, if a behavior is shared more among close than distant relatives, it must be genetic. One example of this approach, which we will examine more deeply later in this lecture, is the covariance of relatedness and the incidence of depression."
"The flaw here, however, is that environment is shared more among close relatives than distant ones. One sophisticated contemporary approach states: “If two individuals raised in an identical environment but with different genes differ in a behavior, then that behavioral difference can’t be due to environment. ”  This brings us to the gold mine of comparing identical and fraternal twins."
"The general approach is to study identical twins raised in the same household and fraternal twins raised in the same household. If the study of fraternal twins reveals differences, the assumption is that those differences must reflect genetics, given the shared environment. An example of findings with this approach is the study of the heritability of obsessive-compulsive disorder."
"One problem with the twin approach is that environment is not identical, particularly for fraternal twins and especially if fraternal twins are of different genders. A study of the influence of gender and math skills underscores the potential importance of environmental factors. A small difference in average performance and a big difference in the extremes of math achievement between boys and girls were discovered."
"Differences were demonstrable among early adolescents, at a level when all students took the same classes. Hence, we have the claim by the authors of the study that the educational environment was identical. But were the students’ educational environments identical?"
"Not when boys are praised by teachers in that environment more than girls and girls underestimate their math abilities even when those abilities show the same level of performance as that of boys. Another study looked at the differences in activity in newborns as a function of gender and ethnicity, but environmental differences can be shown to exist even within minutes of birth. Another contemporary approach states, “If two individuals share many genes but live in different environments and if they share a behavior, then that behavior must be genetic."
"” This leads to the classic adoption approach, an example of which is the Kety studies and the genetic contribution to schizophrenia. There are problems with this approach as well. Are environments really different?"
"No, not with nonrandom placement by adoption agencies trying to place children with parents of the same race and ethnicity and other factors. Another flaw with this approach is the reality that an adopted child shared a great deal with its mother in the fetal environment. Another contemporary approach states, “If two individuals with identical genes but raised in different environments share a behavior, then that behavior must be genetic."
"” Identical twins separated at birth are the holy grail of behavior genetics. The sorts of findings involving such individuals  include the extent of heritability for IQ, introversion/extroversion, and degree of aggression. There are some drawbacks with this approach as well because environment and genetics are so closely intertwined."
"Another contemporary approach states, “If a behavior is demonstrable before there are any relevant environmental influences, then it must be genetic. ” Some animal examples support that approach. Rhesus monkeys raised in isolation express subordinate gestures when confronted with a threatening rhesus face."
Rodents raised in a lab have an aversion to cat smell. Some human examples support that approach as well. Babies who are blind smile at the same age socially as infants who can see.
"Likewise, congenitally deaf babies begin babbling at the same time as hearing babies. The major problem with this approach is that environment does not begin at birth. A fetus shares an intimate circulatory environment with its mother and her environment."
What outside influences reach a fetus? Hormones: Whatever hormonal events are going on in the mother’s body can influence the offspring. Nutrients: Glucose and other nutrients are delivered to the baby through the mother’s bloodstream.
"Sounds: After developing a working auditory system, a fetus can hear sounds. The endocrine environment for a fetus is affected in many ways. Hormones can reach the fetal circulation transplacentally."
"Mechanisms at the placental boundary prevent some hormones from reaching the fetus, but many get through. Because a rodent fetus is getting bathed in the hormones of its closest sibling, hormonal events may depend on whether the sibling next to it in the uterus is the same sex. If female rodents are exposed to a lot of male sex hormones during development, they will start ovulating at a later age than the average female, and they will become infertile at an earlier age."
"Likewise, they will show more characteristics of rough-and-tumble play as rat pups. The amount of stress hormones a mother secretes during pregnancy can affect a fetus’s development as well. In rodents, long-lasting effects can be seen in brain development, cognition, and emotion."
Stress during pregnancy can also lead to the “nongenetic” inheritance of traits across generations. Prenatal maternal stress during the third trimester has been found to lead to smaller head circumference in human babies. The nutritional environment for a fetus is equally important.
Food availability in the outside world gets translated into nutrient levels in the fetal circulation. An astonishing example is metabolic programming and the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944−1945. Prenatal malnutrition led to development of the thrifty metabolism in fetuses.
"Later in life, individuals who developed such thrifty metabolisms were found to develop long-term disease consequences, such as increased risk of hypertension, obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The multigenerational consequences of such deprivation have also been identified, including subtle malnutrition of fetuses born of women who developed the thrifty metabolism. A third area of interest is the auditory environment for a fetus."
"The body is a great resonating chamber; thus, when a mother reads to her unborn baby, her voice resonates internally, and the fetus senses the rhythm and meter of the sound of books being read. Studies of prenatal learning show that babies recognize the difference between new books and books read to them by their mothers during the last trimester of their development. Studies of fathers’ or other outsiders’ readings do not show the same results."
"The implications of prenatal environmental effects are extraordinary. Traits can be inherited multigenerationally and have nothing to do with genetics. Some final critical points still must be covered: What does it mean when a behavior in a plant or animal is found to be, say, 60 percent “heritable”?"
"69  Everyone thinks this term means that some gene is 60 percent responsible for controlling some behavior. What heritability actually means is the degree to which genes account for the variance of some trait, not the average amounts of some trait. You cannot determine what percentage of a behavior is under the control of genetics."
"Gene-environment interactions must be considered, not just genes or environment. An amazing example: A certain type of serotonin transporter gene increases your risk of clinical depression if and only if you are raised in a stressful environment. The lectures in this module focus on how insights about the human brain and behavior can be derived from the study of animals in their natural habitat."
"This approach, termed ethology, developed as a counter to behaviorist psychology, which basically had the view that a rat equals a pigeon equals a monkey equals a human and that rules of behavior are universal, transcending particular species. Ethology counters this view, and the purpose of these lectures will be to examine the neurobiology of human behavior in the context of our being only one of many social species. A huge percentage of what we know about the brain bases of behavior comes from the study of laboratory animals."
"The field of ethology was founded on the utterly correct idea that an animal in captivity rarely behaves normally. The rationale for studying ethology is that if you really want to understand an animal’s behavior, you have to study it in the context of that animal’s natural setting. Back to the limbic system: How do you understand how a brain region influences a particular behavior if you do not understand the behavior?"
And how normal is an animal’s behavior in a cage? Thus developed the field of ethology: the study of animals in their natural setting. The historical context of ethology is interesting because it developed as a counterbalance to behaviorism.
"In the mid-20th century, psychology in America was dominated by behaviorism. B. F."
"Skinner, the most famous adherent to behaviorism, believed, “Pigeon, rat, monkey, boy. It doesn’t matter. ” He believed that all behavior could be shaped by reward and punishment."
"Meanwhile, out in the marshes and woods of Europe, ethology was being founded. One of the founders, Niko Tinbergen, summed up his philosophy in this sentence: “An experiment should be like a conversation with an animal…but in the animal’s own language. ” Tinbergen, Karl von Frisch, and Konrad Lorenz won a Nobel Prize for founding ethology."
"They believed that the behavior of any given species is a unique set of solutions to a unique history of environmental challenges. We need to look at the approach of ethology. The first question Tinbergen, von Frisch, and Lorenz asked was always: “What’s the behavior?"
” They  looked for the fixed action patterns  and strived to objectively describe the behavior. The second question they asked was: “What is the behavior good for? ” They studied the adaptive value of the behavior.
"The third question they asked was: “What triggers this behavior? What were the releasing stimuli for the FAP? Finally, they asked: “How is the behavior mediated physiologically?"
"” What were the innate releasing mechanisms that led to the behavior? They also looked at what role learning plays in behavior, including imprinting and prepared learning, which will be covered in Lecture 18. FAPs merit more detailed study."
"Is talking about FAPs just a fancy way of talking about “instincts”? Ethologists tried to tame the notions of instincts for aggression or maternal behavior or xenophobia and break them down into FAPs—more manageable packages for narrow, explicit behaviors. Ethologists observed that FAPs are expressed in the absence of learning and experience but are subsequently shaped by experience."
We have several examples of FAPs. Baby squirrels know how to crack nuts the first time they see one. They do not need to learn by trial and error or by mimicking an adult squirrel.
"However, the more they do it, the better and faster they get. As we have seen, isolation-reared vervet monkeys recognize and react appropriately to a threatening vervet monkey face. With more social experience, the isolation-reared monkey learns more appropriate behavior."
"Vervet monkeys also have two different alarm calls, one signaling others to get up a tree because a snake is approaching and one signaling others to get down because a raptor bird is coming. The proof that adult vervets understand the principles of ethology comes in discovering that adults ignore these vocalizations when they are emitted by young monkeys because the young are likely to give incorrect signals; they do not react until an adult vervet confirms the alarm call. Human infants smile even in utero, but we learn to smile in appropriate Baby squirrels know how to crack nuts the first time they see one."
"They do not need to learn by trial and error or by mimicking an adult squirrel. 73 contexts. Perfect pitch in humans has a significant genetic component, but it also requires a musical environment early in life for it to develop."
The adaptive value of FAPs is also worth examining more closely. The ethologists’ view of the adaptive value of FAPs differs from the justso stories of many evolutionary biologists. Some examples of adaptive behavior prove the point.
"Tinbergen discovered that gulls turn the eggshells of their chicks to show the outer speckled side after the chick has hatched to protect the chicks from predators. This works, because the pure white inner-shell fragments more readily attract the attention of a predator. Von Frisch studied bee dances, which bees use to communicate to other bees the location of a food source."
"Sick lizards give themselves a fever, aiding their immune systems. We start with the basic questions of ethology and its intersection with neurobiology. After studying FAPs and adaptive value, ethologists look at releasing stimuli."
"This intersection of sensory systems and the limbic system explains why scientists used to call the limbic system the “nose brain” . The experimental approach includes substitution, replication, and superstimulation. Examples of releasing stimuli reveal that there are all different types of sensory communication and that they differ dramatically from species to species."
"A male deer attracts a mate by vocalizing; an electric fish, in contrast, courts through emitting electric “songs. ” Turkey mating requires visual stimuli. Olfaction and mating among rodents involves pheromones."
"Through pheromonal information alone, these animals can tell what the gender of another rodent is, what that individual’s health status is, whether it is stressed or scared, and whether it is ovulating or has testes. What releasing stimulus makes an infant monkey become attached to its mother? The brilliant, disturbing studies of Harry Harlow showed that, when given a choice between an artificial mother that was made of chicken wire and gave milk and a similar chicken-wire mother who gave no milk but was covered with soft felt, the baby monkeys chose the felt-covered mothers."
This experiment marked the defeat of simplistic behaviorism. Threatening faces and activation of the amygdala in humans serve as another example. Is the face of someone of another race a releasing stimulus for amygdala activation?
"It depends on the setting and context. Experiments have shown that if a viewer is forced to think of the person of another race as an individual , the amygdala does not activate when that person’s picture is viewed. Ethologists also study innate releasing mechanisms."
This used to be an area where ethologists just speculated. The blending of the techniques of ethology and of neurobiology has led to some striking discoveries. Scientists now understand the neurobiology of seasonal bird song dialects.
"The circuitry diagram of the lordosis reflex has been charted with a neuroethological map. Trauma produces a hyperreactive amygdala, and scientists are close to constructing a circuitry map for posttraumatic stress disorder. Learning is an area that ethologists have studied as well."
"To a behaviorist, learning is related to the world of punishment and rewards. One depressing example that runs counter to the behaviorist view, while supporting that of ethology, concerns cases of abuse: Why do some of us love individuals who treat us poorly? What learning means to an ethologist is different from what learning is to behaviorists."
"Traditional learning: Ethologists have found that traditional learning occurs in unlikely places. For example, they have found that primate maternal competence is not an instinct; it is learned over time. Imprinting: In working with ducklings, Lorenz studied imprinting and saw how baby ducks learned to identify their mother."
Prepared learning: Ethologists found that certain behaviors are learned more easily than others. Naïve birds exposed to songs from their own species and those of a related species are more likely to learn songs of their own species. Monkeys are predisposed to be terrified of snakes.
The sauce béarnaise syndrome shows that humans who are nauseated associate their sickness with tastes more readily than with sounds. Babies can learn the phonemes of any language but are better at recognizing language than nonlanguage sounds. The place of ethology is critically important.
"Studying behavior in its natural setting is truly helpful. We cannot understand the brain and how it works without understanding the special evolutionary and ecological settings, the  solutions, and the language of behavior that each species has developed. But what is the natural setting of a human?"
"The previous modules have examined how the brain produces individual differences in behavior and how such brain function is regulated. With this interdisciplinary approach in hand, this final module applies this framework to an actual example of behavior. To do so, we will focus on the neurobiology of aggression."
"This subject has been chosen for two reasons. First, an enormous amount is known about the subject , and the subject is particularly amenable to an integration of the various approaches introduced in this course. Second, there are few subjects more important for people to understand—a dire threat to our future is the human capacity for violence."
"The structure of these lectures will be to first present an extensive overview of the neurobiology of aggression, including the relevant parts of the brain and the neurotransmitters involved. Following that, we will examine how that neurobiology has been influenced by the other factors in the course, beginning with the hormones that may have altered the functioning of neurons one second before the aggressive act occurred, through the other factors, and ending with the evolution of aggression. What have we accomplished so far?"
"We have studied the biological components of behavior from a single neuron to neuronal networks to the many parts of the brain, and we have studied other disciplines that help us better understand human behavior. We have emphasized, throughout the course, the importance of the interaction and interdependency of these disciplines. Next, we move to an attempt at further integration in studying the neurobiology of aggression."
"What do we mean by aggression? If we look at human aggression in the context of other animals, we need to ask if we are the only species that: Kills? Kills infants?"
Has organized group violence? The answer to all of these questions is no. Animal reins on aggression include hierarchies  and reconciliation.
We do see some human specialties when it comes to aggression. We can communicate aggression with abstraction over space and time. Some people display sexual aggression.
"We have created a technology of aggression, going beyond muscle and teeth to intentional invention of tools of destruction. We have developed organized aggression above the level of a local band. We exhibit passive aggression."
"This is a difficult subject because we all know the pleasures of a well-timed act of aggression. We continue by implicating the limbic system in aggression. The KluverBucy syndrome was an experimental technique that was done on laboratory  animals in the 1930s, whereby a region of the limbic system was removed."
"Such animals displayed abnormal sexual behavior and odd levels of aggression. The amygdala is highly relevant and highly implicated in studying aggression. Some of the experimental techniques that have implicated the amygdala include creation of brain lesions, stimulation, recording, and functional brain imaging."
"Another implication of the amygdala in  aggression is the study of Charles Whitman, a mass murderer in the 1960s. When he was autopsied after he killed himself, he was found to have an amygdaloid tumor. What are the inputs to and outputs from the amgydala?"
"Inputs include stress hormones, pain, and filtered and unfiltered sensory information. Outputs include projections to the brain regions that regulate the sympathetic nervous system, stress hormone release, and motoric output. Is the amygdala about aggression or about fear and anxiety?"
"Fear conditioning and the amygdala show that you can learn fearful responses. Stress can lead to amygdaloid expansion and posttraumatic stress disorder. As we saw in Lecture 18, amygdaloid activation when we see a person of another race is not a hard-wired fear but can be conditioned."
"exual arousal and amygdaloid activation in males may provide a link to sexual violence. Other brain structures are relevant in our study of aggression. The septum puts the metaphorical brake on aggression, working in opposition to the amygdala."
"The lateral hypothalamus was thought for decades to be tied to aggression. More recently, however, this part of the brain has been found to be related to feeding  rather than to aggression. Hindbrain and brainstem structures become metabolically active and cause arousal during both extremely violent states and greatly euphoric states, hence the famous quote from Nobel Laureate Elie Weisel: “The opposite of love is not hate."
"The opposite of love is indifference. ”  The critical role of the frontal cortex is to get you to do the harder thing. First, we look at doing the harder thing in the cognitive realm."
"Executive function helps you strategize what to do with facts. It is your working memory. Reversal tasks, such as reciting months and numbers backwards, reveal how difficult it is to overcome ingrained patterns."
"Neurons of the frontal cortex activate in response to rules rather than in response to specific examples. Next, we look at doing the harder thing in the realm of emotional regulation and emotional disinhibition. Phineas Gage, a railroad worker in the 1840s, suffered a frontal cortical lesion in a serious accident."
"Overnight, he changed from a sober man to a profane, aggressive, socially inappropriate man who could never work again. The loss of his frontal cortex meant he lost his emotional regulation; he had no means to do the “harder thing. ” Frontotemporal dementia and stroke damage to the frontal cortex may cause inappropriate, d i s i n h i b i t e d behaviors."
"The frontal cortex goes offline during rapid eye movement  sleep, which explains why dreams are often wild and unrepressed. Frontal hyperactivity can result in repressive personalities—individuals with tightly regulated emotions. Finally, we look at doing the harder thing in the realm of behavior."
We saw in Lecture 12 the role of frontal cortical activation during decision making and gratification postponement. The study of frontal function in violent sociopaths reveals two very interesting results. These individuals often exhibit abnormally low basal activity or histories of frontal damage.
"They also often exhibit abnormally high activity when engaged in an executive task—in other words, they need to activate more of the frontal cortex than other people in order to regulate their behavior appropriately. The frontal cortex among primates is fairly large and well developed, but humans have a uniquely large frontal cortex. The study of the frontal cortex and development in humans has also been revelatory."
"Children are frontally disinhibited beings. Adolescents still are frontally disinhibited beings because of the remarkably late maturation of the frontal cortex. With this in mind, we need to ask if a 16-year-old violent criminal is, by definition, organically impaired in frontal cortical function."
"The frontal cortex and its interactions with other brain regions are important to our understanding of aggression. The frontal cortex is an inhibitor of the amygdala. Conversely, the amygdala sends inputs to the frontal cortex to do the easier thing."
"Serotonergic projections are also sent into the frontal cortex and play a role in inhibiting impulsive behavior. Therefore, low serotonin levels are associated with impulsive aggression. The dopamine projection is sent from the ventral tegmentum into the frontal cortex."
"Dopamine is the neurotransmitter of pleasure or, more correctly, of the anticipation of pleasure. Dopamine, metaphorically, fuels the ability of the frontal cortex to hold out for the harder thing. A subtlety of frontal cortical function during aggression merits discussion."
"Sometimes inhibiting aggression is a case of doing the harder thing, as when you are angry and wish to lash out but control yourself. On the other hand, there are situations in which being aggressive is a case of doing the harder thing, as in wartime when you must choose to fight amid a strong incentive to flee. What releasing stimuli bias the nervous system toward aggression?"
"Fear, pain, stress, and frustration are all routes for decreased dopamine transmission. The role of alcohol in violence has been overrated; alcohol causes violence in individuals already prone to violence. Likewise, the role of crowding 85 has been overrated."
"Like alcohol, crowding causes violence in individuals already prone to violence. We also need to look at acute hormonal effects on the neurobiology of aggression, particularly the key role of testosterone in male aggression. Correlative evidence gives us the first clues."
"Testosterone levels and levels of aggression are a function of gender, age, and season. There are a lot of testosterone receptors in the amygdala. Causal evidence includes the euphemistically termed subtraction and replacement approaches."
"With subtraction, the testes are removed from a male, and his aggression levels are found to go down. With replacement, after removal of the testes, the male’s testosterone is replaced by synthetic testosterone, and his aggressive behavior returns. We now have evidence that shows the limited role of testosterone in aggression."
"Castration reduces but does not eliminate aggression. The more precastration aggressive experience an individual has, the greater the amounts of his postcastration aggression. Does testosterone cause aggression?"
"The answer relates to the metaphor of increasing the volume of the radio playing martial music, rather than turning on the radio in the first place. Neurobiological evidence states that testosterone does not activate amygdaloid neurons  but, rather, makes amygdaloid neurons that are already excited more excitable . Do individual differences in testosterone levels explain individual differences in levels of aggression?"
"Fluctuation in testosterone levels within the physiological range does not generally cause changes in aggression. But there is a consistent correlation between the two, with aggression elevating testosterone levels, rather than the other way around. Testosterone levels above the normal range may result when someone takes anabolic steroids."
"The conclusion is that one hormone cannot explain aggression. A striking example of proof comes from studying murder rates in London, Toronto, and Detroit. In men in all three cities, the highest levels of aggression were found to occur at the same ages ."
"However, amid that similarity, there were enormous differences in the absolute number of murders among the three cities, showing the importance of environment in aggression. We also need to look at hormones and female aggression. Testosteronerelated  hormones come from the adrenal gland."
Estrogen and progesterone are also relevant for female aggression. The ratio of the two is more important than the levels. Fluctuating ratios around menstruation have been tied to patterns of criminal behavior in women during the perimenstrual period.
Fluctuating ratios around parturition explain why you do not pick up cute newborn kittens when their mother is nearby. We must also consider stress hormones and aggression in both genders. Sympathetic nervous system activity is a nonspecific marker in aggression.
"Glucocorticoids can have two interesting yet disturbing effects. Glucocorticoids can cause enhancement of amygdaloid function, leading to posttraumatic stress disorder. Glucocorticoids can cause disruption of frontal cortical function, causing us to make imprudent decisions in moments of stress."
"Some major theories about environmental factors in aggression are worthy of consideration. The Lorenzian notion that aggression is universal, inevitable, and self-depleting is not tenable. Marxist models of aggression are based on fear and resource inequity, but many types of animal aggression have been identified when resources are plentiful."
"The behaviorist view was that the right reinforcement schedule can make aggression disappear, but a 225-yearlong experiment partially refutes this view: The death penalty tends to drive down instances of premeditated violence, but it has little effect on impulsive violent behavior. We now turn to child development, aggression, and empathy. The differentiation of the self in toddlers is key."
Ego boundary issues exist because a toddler is distinguishing where his mother ends and he begins as an individual. Studies have shown that other species have a self-concept as well. The emergence of theory of mind is the recognition that other individuals have other thoughts and knowledge than you.
"Human versions display a recognition that others have different feelings, needs, and capacities for pain than oneself. Nonhuman primate versions have shown that a chimpanzee can understand what information another chimpanzee has and can shape its behavior accordingly. The emergence of empathy begs the question as to whether theory of mind is necessary and/or sufficient to give rise to that quality."
"What appears to be empathy in toddlers, who do not yet demonstrate theory of mind, may instead be an expression of ego boundary problems or distress reduction. The learning of rules about the appropriate context for aggression often drives development. We have seen the Harlow studies of social isolation in young primates in Lecture 18."
"Learning your rank as a social primate is part of growing up. Primates who grow up without a mother to show them the rules may be inappropriately aggressive. Scientists have also studied whether early exposure to violence begets later violence, thus legitimizing its rationales and habituating to its harmful consequences."
"Childhood abuse studies show that adults who are child abusers tend to have been abused as children, but most children who are abused do not grow up to be child abusers. Television violence increases violence in those children who are already prone toward it. Being raised in cultures with credos of victimization and justified revenge is more likely to lead to socially inappropriate behavior."
"Being raised in authoritarian cultures, with emphases on externalizing of blame, on conforming, and on rigid, unreflective cognitive styles is also more likely to lead to socially inappropriate behavior. We now look at moral development in children. Kohlberg’s three stages of moral development were based on the immediacy of punishment."
"In the Pre-Conventional stage, moral behavior is about the immediate consequences. In the Conventional stage, the individual leaps into the realm of societal rules and conventions. Individuals see the consequences of their actions down the road ."
"In the Post-Conventional stage, the sense of morality is that the right thing is independent of contracts and rules and convention. Actions are based more on simply deciding to do the right thing, no matter what the laws or consequences are. Some people never attain that stage."
"Critiques of Kohlberg say that the stages fit males more than females and are culturally biased as well, being quite Eurocentric. Does one’s Kohlberg stage actually predict anything about behavior? Not especially."
Does it help us predict who will step out of a crowd to do the hard but right thing? Not particularly. A better predictor is doing moral acts as a frequent childhood imperative.
How do we frame the possible neurobiological underpinnings of moral developmental stages? Is climbing up the Kohlberg ladder merely a function of getting a more mature frontal cortex that has more and more potentiated pathways and is more adept at gratification postponement? Yet most advanced stages of moral development seem outside the purview of the frontal cortex.
"This is the realm where no degree of gratification postponement can explain doing the harder thing; this is because there is no gratification, and instead, you may be punished for doing the harder but right thing. Reflexive moral acts and implicit neural pathways outside the frontal cortex are still a mystery. Another issue is development and adolescent male aggression."
"We know by now to be wary of the correlation between a peak in aggression during adolescence in males and a peak in testosterone levels. Remember the study of aggression in young males in London, Toronto, and Detroit in Lecture 21. A peak in alcoholrelated aggression has been studied in alcoholics."
"Cross-cultural differences in aggression dwarf developmental patterns. Again, remember the study of aggression in young males in London, Toronto, and Detroit. A nonhuman primate example of this idea is the cultural transmission of a baboon troop’s social tradition of low aggression."
Another predictor of adult antisocial behavior is being an unwanted child. We now shift to study long-term physiological effects in the form of perinatal hormones. We look first at organizational effects of hormones during perinatal life as opposed to activational effects during adulthood.
"The organizational effects of androgens on subsequent aggression are of great interest. Rodent studies , as we saw in Lecture 16, show that prenatal testosterone masculinizes patterns of aggression and makes for individuals, including females, who are more aggressive and more easily provoked toward aggression. Primate studies show the same results."
"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in human females is the result of being exposed to a lot of testosterone prenatally. These girls grow up to display higher than expected levels of aggression and less interest in genderspecific toys. However, they also have been exposed to multiple painful and embarrassing surgeries and often are treated differently by parents because of their ambiguous gender, all of which may affect behavior."
"Now we shift one step further back and look at the long-term physiological effects of genes. This is a dirty concept in many quarters, implying the shadows of eugenics and of washing one’s hands of unappealing behaviors. Yet there must be a genetic component to aggression."
"Otherwise, why you would trust your baby to a beagle more readily than to a pit bull? What genes are likely to be relevant to aggression? The answer is those genes related to pain thresholds, frustration thresholds, impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and emotional regulation."
"In that context, a number of genes that have been implicated in aggressive behavior relate to neurotransmitter systems—genes that are relevant to many other realms of behavior as well. We can consider a model for how genetic influences might work. As a review, we saw in Lecture 16 a study of a large population of children that showed a correlation between serotonin and depression in certain environments."
"Further study was done of different versions of genes relevant to serotonin synthesis, degradation, transport, and so on. It was found that a certain gene variant or monoamine oxidase  is predictive of antisocial behavior in humans but only when coupled with a childhood history of abuse. Let’s end the lecture by debunking an urban myth about genes and aggression."
"While in prison, Richard Speck, a mass murderer from the 1960s, was discovered to be an XYY male instead of a normal XY male. This prompted the idea that XYY males were genetically prone toward violence, an idea not supported by evidence. Let’s begin by looking at some ecological correlates of aggression."
Warrior classes and high levels of aggression are more common among pastoralists than among agriculturalists. Organized aggression is also more common among desert dwellers than among rainforest dwellers. Why ever be aggressive?
"Let’s rethink Marlin Perkins’s claim that animals behave for the good of the species. Individual selection and its propagation of aggression disprove Perkins’s notion and provide the first bad news about evolutionary biology. Male-male aggression for reproductive access to females is a common form of violence in primate species, including humans."
Competitive infanticide offers the most heartbreaking evidence against group selection. Kin selection helps explain us/them dichotomies and the roots of xenophobia. We have seen the results of kinship and cooperative aggression among male chimpanzees.
"We also see kinship and organized aggression in patrilocal human societies. Humans, pseudokinship, and pseudospeciation merit examination as well. Lots of species recognize a relative through innate recognition of sensory information."
Humans recognize relatives through cognitive routes. An implication of this fact is that a human’s sense of relatedness can be  manipulated. An example of such manipulation is the sociological concept of pseudokinship and the idea of “bands of brothers.
"” Military rituals throughout human cultures build such a bond. The unprecedented pseudokinship of American troops in World War II underscores the strength of this bond. The flip side of pseudokinship is pseudospeciation, where enemies are portrayed as hardly counting as human."
"Let’s now look at the first piece of good news that arises from kin selection. If you can pseudospeciate someone into being an enemy, you can pseudokinship back from that state. Rituals of pseudokinship among ex-enemies prove that this change is possible."
"We saw another example of this transformation in Lectures 18 and 19, where we found that viewing strangers as individuals rather than categorically helped tame the amygdala. More good news is found in studies of alternative strategies among males in the primate world. Studies were done of groups of baboons in which malefemale affiliation, rather than male-male competition, drives who females choose to mate with."
"Reproductive success among such male baboons has shown that this is a successful evolutionary alternative. More good news is evident in reciprocal altruism and cooperation. Back in Lecture 12, we learned about the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the strategic advantages of cooperation."
"We also discussed how to jumpstart cooperation in game theory settings, looking at the effects of inbred populations, multiple rounds of games, reputation, punishment of cheaters, and choice of partners as circumstances that increase the likelihood of increasing cooperation. Whatever the route, reciprocal altruism and cooperation can emerge, even in the most inauspicious of circumstances. A vivid example occurred during World War I, with the Christmas truce and spontaneous mutual restraint in trench warfare."
"Maybe, just maybe, there is hope. How are we to understand this emerging biology of what makes us who we are? We must draw a distinction between the essence of who a person is and the biology that can constrain and distort that essence."
We must be careful in deciding when that distinction is readily made and when it is not. An examination of some subtle neuropsychiatric disorders underscores the difficulty of such a distinction. We have discussed the effects of frontal cortical damage numerous times.
"In 20, we heard about the effects of damage to the frontal cortex in Phineas Gage. We have learned that frontotemporal dementia may cause inappropriate, disinhibited behaviors. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder."
"Its features include ritualistic counting, obsessive hand-washing, and constant and repeated checking to ensure that one has completed common activities, such as locking the door or turning off the gas. We see here an emerging neurobiology of elevated metabolism in motoric parts of the brain. Tourette’s syndrome is a disorder with symptoms that include uncontrollable cursing, facial ticks, yelps, and inappropriate gestures."
It has received a lot of attention in neuropsychiatric circles lately. This is not a disinhibition of the self. It has been termed “hiccups of the id.
” Here we see emerging neurogenetics of the disease. Schizotypal personality disorder is a mild version of schizophrenia. It is on a genetic and symptomatic continuum with schizophrenia.
"Its symptoms include social withdrawal, concreteness in interpretation of events, and metamagical thinking. Is it a mental illness to consult astrologers? No, these traits are the extremes of normative thinking."
"Temporal lobe personality disorder is a subtype of epilepsy. In temporal lobe epilepsy, seizures start in the temporal lobe, which is part of the limbic system. Among the disorder’s symptoms is an obsession with religious and philosophical subjects."
Then comes the challenge of this new information. What happens when we each have a few of these labels? What happens when this science stops being about the biology of “them and their diseases” and becomes the biology of “us and our individuality”?
"Some societal implications are inevitable. The downside may be devastating. If you get one of these labels and you are poor or poorly connected, there are great precedents for you now being treated poorly by society."
"The temptation to “fix what ain’t broken” is a historical force of evil in biology. The important questions are: What counts as being ill? Who is biologically impaired, and who is just different?"
"But there is an optimistic side as well. We can strive to reach new realms of compassion in dealing with debilitating psychiatric diseases and disorders. We can work to develop pseudokinship through neurobiology, including the recognition of continua of disorder symptoms and a reality of “There but for the grace of God go I."
"” Finally, perhaps we will someday acknowledge that being healthy consists of having the same diseases as everyone else and the same values as to what is a disease and what is healthy, what is normal and what is abnormal. Some philosophical implications are equally important. What will these biological insights do to our treasured sense of uniqueness?"
"As science explains more and more about less and less, will we all be explained as no more than a mass of neurons and hormones, no longer special and different? As in the story Nine Billion Names of God, will the stars in the heavens be extinguished because science will have explained everything in our universe? Such scientific explanations and progress should not be feared."
"To explain something is not to destroy the capacity to be moved by it. And certainly, we can never explain everything, because every answer opens up a dozen new questions. To paraphrase Haldane, “Life is not only stranger than we imagine, life is stranger than we can imagine."
"” Thus, in the end, the  purpose of science is not to cure us of our sense of mystery and wonder but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it. acetylcholine: A neurotransmitter whose functions include release from the ends of the final neurons in the parasympathetic nervous system. action potential: The burst of electrical excitation that shoots down the axon when a neuron is sufficiently stimulated via its dendrites."

"Neurons are remarkable among the cells of the body in their ability to propagate signals rapidly over large distances. They do this by generating characteristic electrical pulses called action potentials, or more simply spikes, that can travel down nerve fibers. Neurons represent and transmit information by firing sequences of spikes in various temporal patterns."
"The study of neural coding, which is the subject of the first four chapters of this book, involves measuring and characterizing how stimulus attributes, such as light or sound intensity, or motor actions, such as the direction of an arm movement, are represented by action potentials. The link between stimulus and response can be studied from two opposite points of view. Neural encoding, the subject of chapters 1 and 2, refers to the map from stimulus to response."
"For example, we can catalogue how neurons respond to a wide variety of stimuli, and then construct models that attempt to predict responses to other stimuli. Neural decoding refers to the reverse map, from response to stimulus, and the challenge is to reconstruct a stimulus, or certain aspects of that stimulus, from the spike sequences it evokes. Neural decoding is discussed in chapter 3."
"In chapter 4, we consider how the amount of information encoded by sequences of action potentials can be quantified and maximized. Before embarking on this tour of neural coding, we briefly review how neurons generate their responses and discuss how neural activity is recorded. The biophysical mechanisms underlying neural responses and action potential generation are treated in greater detail in chapters 5 and 6."
"Neurons are highly specialized for generating electrical signals in response to chemical and other inputs, and transmitting them to other cells. Some important morphological specializations, seen in the drawings of figure 1. 1, are the dendrites that receive inputs from other neurons and the axon that carries the neuronal output to other cells."
The elaborate branching structure of the dendritic tree allows a neuron to receive inputs from many other neurons through synaptic connections. The cortical pyramidal neuron of figure 1. 1A and the cortical interneuron of figure 1.
"1C each receives thousands of synaptic inputs, and for the cerebellar Purkinje cell of figure 1. 1B the number is over 100,000. Figure 1."
"1 does not show the full extent of the axons of these neurons. Axons from single neurons can traverse large fractions of the brain or, in some cases, of the entire body. In the mouse brain, it has been estimated that cortical neurons typically send out a total of about 40 mm of axon and have approximately 4 mm of total dendritic cable in their branched dendritic trees."
"The axon makes an average of 180 synaptic connections with other neurons per mm of length while the dendritic tree receives, on average, 2 synaptic inputs per µm. The cell body or soma of a typical cortical neurons ranges in diameter from about 10 to 50 µm. Along with these morphological features, neurons have physiological specializations."
"Most prominent among these are a wide variety of membrane-spanning ion channels that allow ions, predominantly sodium , potassium , calcium , and chloride , to move into and out of the cell. Ion channels control the flow of ions across the cell membrane by opening and closing in response to voltage changes and both internal and external signals. The electrical signal of relevance to the nervous system is the difference in electrical potential between the interior of a neuron and the surrounding extracellular medium."
"Under resting conditions, the potential inside the cell membrane of a neuron is about -70 mV relative to that of the surrounding bath , and the cell is said to be polarized. Ion pumps located in the cell membrane maintain concentration gradients that support this membrane potential difference. For example, Na+ is much more concentrated outside a neuron than inside it, and the concentration of K+ is significantly higher inside the neuron than in the extracellular medium."
"Ions thus flow into and out of a cell due to both voltage and concentration gradients. Current, in the form of positively charged ions flowing out of the cell  through open channels makes the membrane potential more negative, a process called hyperpolarization. Current flow ing into the cell changes the membrane potential to less negative or even positive values."
"This is called depolarization. If a neuron is depolarized sufficiently to raise the membrane potential above a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the neuron generates an action potential. An action potential is a roughly 100 mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that lasts for about 1 ms ."
"Action potential generation also depends on the recent history of cell firing. For a few milliseconds just after an action potential has been fired, it may be virtually impossible to initiate another spike. This is called the absolute refractory period."
"For a longer interval known as the relative refractory period, lasting up to tens of milliseconds after a spike, it is more difficult to evoke an action potentials. Action potentials are of great importance because they are the only form of membrane potential fluctuation that can propagate over large distances. Subthreshold potential fluctuations are severely attenuated over distances of 1 mm or less."
"Action potentials, on the other hand, are regenerated actively along axon processes and can travel rapidly over large distances without attenuation. Axons terminate at synapses where the voltage transient of the action potential opens ion channels producing an influx of Ca2+ that leads to the release of a neurotransmitter . The neurotransmitter binds to receptors at the signal receiving or postsynaptic side of the synapse causing ion-conducting channels to open."
"Depending on the nature of the ion flow, the synapses can have either an excitatory, depolarizing, or an inhibitory, typically hyperpolarizing, effect on the postsynaptic neuron. Figure 1,3 illustrates intracellular and extracellular methods for recording neuronal responses electrically . Membrane potentials are measured intracellularly by connecting to a neuron a hollow glass electrode filled with a conducting electrolyte, and comparing the potential it records to that of a reference electrode placed in the extracellular medium."
"Intracellular recordings are made either with sharp electrodes inserted through the membrane into the cell, or patch electrodes  that have broader tips and are sealed tightly to the surface of the membrane. After the patch electrode seals, the membrane beneath its tip is either broken or perforated providing electrical contact with the interior of the cell. The top trace in figure 1."
3 is a schematic of an intracellular recording from the soma of a neuron firing a sequence of action potentials. The recording shows rapid spikes riding on top of a more slowly varying subthreshold potential. The bottom trace in figure 1.
"3 is a schematic of an intracellular recording made some distance out on the axon of the neuron. These traces are drawings, not real recordings, and such intracellular axon recordings, although possible in some types of cells, are difficult and rare. Intracellular recordings from the soma are the norm, but intracellular dendritic recordings are increasingly being made as well."
"The subthreshold membrane potential waveform, apparent in the soma recording, is completely absent on the axon due to attenuation, but the action potential sequence in the two recordings is the same. This illustrates the important point that spikes, but not subthreshold potentials, propagate regeneratively down axons. The middle trace in figure 1,3 illustrates an idealized, noise-free extracellular recording."
"Here an electrode is placed near a neuron but it does not penetrate the cell membrane. Such recordings can reveal the action potentials fired by a neuron, but not its subthreshold membrane potentials. Extracellular recordings are typically used for in vivo experiments, especially those involving behaving animals."
"Intracellular recordings are sometimes made in vivo, but are more commonly used for in vitro preparations such as experiments on slices of neural tissue. The responses studied in this chapter are action potential sequences that can be recorded either intra- or extra-cellularly. Characterizing the relationship between stimulus and response is difficult because neuronal responses are complex and variable."
"Neurons typically respond by producing complex spike sequences that reflect both the intrinsic dynamics of the neuron and the temporal characteristics of the stimulus. Isolating features of the response that encode changes in the stimulus can be difficult, especially if the time scale for these changes is of the same order as the average interval between spikes. Neural responses can vary from trial to trial even when the same stimulus is presented repeatedly."
"There are many potential sources of this variability including variable levels of arousal and attention, randomness associated with various biophysical processes that affect neuronal firing, and the effects of other cognitive processes taking place during a trial. The complexity and trial-to-trial variability of action potential sequences make it unlikely that we can describe and predict the timing of each spike deterministically. Instead, we seek a model that can account for the probabilities that different spike sequences are evoked by a specific stimulus."
"Typically, many neurons respond to a given stimulus, and stimulus features are therefore encoded by the activities of large neural populations. In studying population coding, we must examine not only the firing patterns of individual neurons, but also the relationships of these firing patterns to each other across the population of responding cells. In this chapter, we introduce the firing rate and spike-train correlation functions, which are basic measures of spiking probability and statistics."
"We also discuss spike-triggered averaging, a method for relating action potentials to the stimulus that evoked them. Finally, we present basic stochastic descriptions of spike generation, the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson models, and discuss a simple model of neural responses to which they lead. In chapter 2, we continue our discussion of neural encoding by showing how reverse-correlation methods are used to construct estimates of firing rates in response to time-varying stimuli."
"These methods have been applied extensively to neural responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus, and primary visual cortex, and we review the resulting models. Action potentials convey information through their timing. Although action potentials can vary somewhat in duration, amplitude, and shape, they are typically treated in neural encoding studies as identical stereotyped events."
"If we ignore the brief duration of an action potential , an action potential sequence can be characterized simply by a list of the times when spikes occurred. For n spikes, we denote these times by ti with i = 1, 2,. ."
". , n. The trial during which the spikes are recorded is taken to start at time zero and end at time T, so 0 ≤ ti ≤ T for all i."
"The spike sequence can also be represented as a sum of infinitesimally narrow, idealized spikes in the form of Dirac δ functions . Response tuning curves characterize the average response of a neuron to a given stimulus. We now consider the complementary procedure of averaging the stimuli that produce a given response."
"To average stimuli in this way, we need to specify what fixed response we will use to ‘trigger’ the average. The most obvious choice is the firing of an action potential. Thus, we ask, “what on average did the stimulus do before an action potential was fired?"
"” The resulting quantity, called the spike-triggered average stimulus, provides a useful way of characterizing neuronal selectivity. Spike-triggered averages are computed using stimuli characterized by a parameter s that varies over time. Before beginning our discussion of spike triggering, we describe some features of such stimuli."
"Neurons responding to sensory stimuli face the difficult task of encoding parameters that can vary over an enormous dynamic range. For example, photoreceptors in the retina can respond to single photons or can operate in bright light with an influx of millions of photons per second. To deal with such wide-ranging stimuli, sensory neurons often respond most strongly to rapid changes in stimulus properties and are relatively insensitive to steady-state levels."
"Steady-state responses are highly compressed functions of stimulus intensity, typically with logarithmic or weak powerlaw dependences. This compression has an interesting psychophysical correlate. Weber measured how different the intensity of two stimuli had to be for them to be reliably discriminated, the ‘just noticeable’ difference."
"The spike-triggered average stimulus is widely used to study and characterize neural responses. Because C is the average value of the stimulus a time τ before a spike, larger values of τ represent times further in the past relative to the time of the triggering spike. For this reason, we plot spike-triggered averages with the time axis going backward compared to the normal convention."
This allows the average spike-triggering stimulus to be read off from the plots in the usual left to right order. Figure 1. 9 shows the spike-triggered average stimulus for a neuron in the electrosensory lateral-line lobe of the weakly electric fish Eigenmania.
Weakly electric fish generate oscillating electric fields from an internal electric organ. Distortions in the electric field produced by nearby objects are detected by sensors spread over the skin of the fish. The lateral-line lobe acts as a relay station along the processing pathway for electrosensory signals.
"Fluctuating electrical potentials, such as that shown in the upper left trace of figure 1,9 elicit responses from electrosensory lateral-line lobe neurons, as seen in the lower left trace. The spike-triggered average stimulus, plotted at the right, indicates that, on average, the electric potential made a positive upswing followed by a large negative deviation prior to a spike being fired by this neuron. The results obtained by spike-triggered averaging depend on the particular set of stimuli used during an experiment."
"How should this set be chosen? In chapter 2, we show that there are certain advantages to using a stimulus that is uncorrelated from one time to the next, a white-noise stimulus. A heuristic argument supporting the use of such stimuli is that, in asking what makes a neuron fire, we may want to sample its responses to stimulus fluctuations at all frequencies with equal weight , and this is one of the properties of white noise stimuli."
"In practice, white-noise stimuli can only be generated with equal power up to a finite frequency cutoff, but neurons only respond to stimulus fluctuations within a limited frequency range anyway. Figure 1. 9 is based on a such an approximate white-noise stimulus."
"The power in a signal as a function of its frequency is called the power spectrum or power spectral density, and white noise has a flat power spectrum. A stochastic process that generates a sequence of events, such as action  potentials, is called a point process. In general, the probability of an event occurring at any given time could depend on the entire history of preceding events."
"If this dependence extends only to the immediately preceding event, so that the intervals between successive events are independent, the point process is called a renewal process. If there is no dependence  at all on preceding events, so that the events themselves are statistically independent, we have a Poisson process. The Poisson process provides an extremely useful approximation of stochastic neuronal firing."
"To make  the presentation easier to follow we separate two cases, the homogeneous Poisson process, for which the firing rate is constant over time, and the inhomogeneous Poisson process, which involves a time-dependent firing rate. One possibility is to use the spikes to distinguish slow from rapid, so that a temporal code is identified when peaks in the firing rate occur with roughly the same frequency as the spikes themselves. In this case, each peak corresponds to the firing of only one, or at most a few action potentials."
"While this definition makes intuitive sense, it is problematic to extend it to the case of population coding. When many neurons are involved, any single neuron may fire only a few spikes before its firing rate changes, but collectively the population may produce a large number of spikes over the same time period. Thus, a neuron that appears to employ a temporal code, by this definition, may be part of a population that does not."
"Another proposal is to use the stimulus, rather than the response, to establish what makes a temporal code. In this case, a temporal code is defined as one in which information is carried by details of spike timing on a scale shorter than the fastest time characterizing variations of the stimulus. This requires that information about the stimulus be carried by Fourier components of r at frequencies higher than those present in the stimulus."
"Many of the cases where a temporal code has been reported using spikes to define the nature of the code would be called rate codes if the stimulus were used instead. The debate between rate and temporal coding dominates discussions about the nature of the neural code. Determining the temporal resolution of the neural code is clearly important, but much of this debate seems uninformative."
"We feel that the central challenge is to identify relationships between the firing patterns of different neurons in a responding population and to understand their significance for neural coding. The spike-triggered average stimulus introduced in chapter 1 is a standard way of characterizing the selectivity of a neuron. In this chapter, we show how spike-triggered averages and reverse-correlation techniques can be used to construct estimates of firing rates evoked by arbitrary time-dependent stimuli."
"Firing rates calculated directly from reversecorrelation functions provide only a linear estimate of the response of a neuron, but we also present in this chapter various methods for including nonlinear effects such as firing thresholds. Spike-triggered averages and reverse-correlation techniques have been  used extensively to study properties of visually responsive neurons in the retina , lateral geniculate nucleus , and primary visual cortex . At these early stages of visual processing, the responses of some neurons  can be described quite accurately using this approach."
"Other neurons  can be described by extending the formalism. Reverse-correlation techniques have also been applied to responses of neurons in visual areas V2, area 18, and MT, but they generally fail to capture the more complex and nonlinear features typical of responses at later stages of the visual system. Descriptions of visual responses based on reverse correlation are approximate, and they do not explain how visual responses arise from the synaptic, cellular, and network properties of retinal, LGN, and cortical circuits."
"Nevertheless, they provide a important framework for characterizing response selectivities, a reference point for identifying and characterizing novel effects, and a basis for building mechanistic models, some of which are discussed at the end of this chapter and in chapter 7. Neuronal selectivity is often characterized by describing stimuli that evoke maximal responses. The reverse-correlation approach provides a justification for this procedure by relating the optimal kernel for firing rate estimation to the stimulus predicted to evoke the maximum firing rate, subject to a constraint."
A constraint is essential because the linear estimate 2. 1 is unbounded. The constraint we use is that the time integral of the square of the stimulus over the duration of the trial is held fixed.
"We call this integral the stimulus energy. The stimulus for which equation 2. 1 predicts the maximum response at some fixed time subject to this constraint, is computed in appendix B."
"The result is that the stimulus producing the maximum response is proportional to the optimal linear kernel, or equivalently to the white-noise spike-triggered average stimulus. This is an important result because in cases where a white-noise analysis has not been done, we may still have some idea what stimulus produces the maximum response. The maximum stimulus analysis provides an intuitive interpretation of the linear estimate of equation 2,1."
"At fixed stimulus energy, the integral in 2. 1 measures the overlap between the actual stimulus and the most effective stimulus. In other words, it indicates how well the actual stimulus matches the most effective stimulus."
"Mismatches between these two reduce the value of the integral and result in lower predictions for the firing rate. The optimal kernel produces an estimate of the firing rate that is a linear function of the stimulus. Neurons and nervous systems are nonlinear, so a linear estimate is only an approximation, albeit a useful one."
"The linear prediction has two obvious problems: there is nothing to prevent the predicted firing rate from becoming negative, and the predicted rate does not saturate, but instead increases without bound as the magnitude of the stimulus increases. One way to deal with these and some of the other deficiencies of a linear prediction is to write the firing rate as a background rate plus a nonlinear function of the linearly filtered stimulus. We use L to represent the linear term we have been discussing thus far."
"Before discussing how reverse correlation methods are applied to visually responsive neurons, we review the basic anatomy and physiology of the early stages of the visual system. The conversion of a light stimulus into an electrical signal and ultimately an action potential sequence occurs in the retina. Figure 2."
"4A is an anatomical diagram showing the five principal cell types of the retina, and figure 2. 4B is a rough circuit diagram. In the retina, light is first converted into an electrical signal by a phototransduction cascade within rod and cone photoreceptor cells."
Figure 2. 4B shows intracellular recordings made in neurons of the retina of a mudpuppy . The stimulus used for these recordings was a flash of light falling primarily in the region of the photoreceptor at the left of figure 2.
"4B. The rod cells, especially the one on the left side of figure 2. 4B, are hyperpolarized by the light flash."
"This electrical signal is passed along to bipolar and horizontal cells through synaptic connections. Note that in one of the bipolar cells, the signal has been inverted leading to depolarization. These smoothly changing membrane potentials provide a graded representation of the light intensity during the flash."
"This form of coding is adequate for signaling within the retina, where distances are small. However, it is inadequate for the task of conveying information from the retina to the brain. The output neurons of the retina are the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve."
"As seen in figure 2,4B, the subthreshold potentials of the two retinal ganglion cells shown are similar to those of the bipolar cells immediately above them in the figure, but now with superimposed action potentials. The two retinal ganglion cells shown in the figure have different responses and transmit different sequences of action potentials. G2 fires while the light is on, and G1 fires when it turns off."
"These are called ON and OFF responses, respectively. The optic nerve conducts the output spike trains of retinal ganglion cells to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which acts as a relay station between the retina and primary visual cortex . Prior to arriving at the LGN, some retinal ganglion cell axons cross the midline at the optic chiasm."
"This allow the left and right sides of the visual fields from both eyes to be represented on the right and left sides of the brain respectively . Neurons in the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex respond to light stimuli in restricted regions of the visual field called their receptive fields. Patterns of illumination outside the receptive field of a given neuron cannot generate a response directly, although they can significantly affect responses to stimuli within the receptive field."
"We do not consider such effects, although they are a current focus of experimental and theoretical interest. In the monkey, cortical receptive fields range in size from around a tenth of a degree near the fovea to several degrees in the periphery. Within the receptive fields, there are regions where illumination higher than the background light intensity enhances firing, and other regions where lower illumination enhances firing."
"The spatial arrangement of these regions determines the selectivity of the neuron to different inputs. The term receptive field is often generalized to refer not only to the overall region where light affects neuronal firing, but also to the spatial and temporal structure within this region. Visually responsive neurons in the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex are divided into two classes depending on whether or not the contributions from different locations within the visual field sum linearly, as assumed in equation 2."
"24. X-cells in the cat retina and LGN, P-cells in the monkey retina and LGN, and simple cells in primary visual cortex appear to satisfy this assumption. Other neurons, such as Y cells in the cat retina and LGN, M cells in the monkey retina and LGN, and complex cells in primary visual cortex, do not show linear summation across the spatial receptive field and nonlinearities must be included in descriptions of their responses."
We do this for complex cells later in this chapter. A first step in studying the selectivity of any neuron is to identify the types of stimuli that evoke strong responses. Retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons have similar selectivities and respond best to circular spots of light surrounded by darkness or dark spots surrounded by light.
"In primary visual cortex, many neurons respond best to elongated light or dark bars or to boundaries between light and dark regions. Gratings with alternating light and dark bands are effective and frequently used stimuli for these neurons. Many visually responsive neurons react strongly to sudden transitions in the level of image illumination, a temporal analog of their responsiveness to light-dark spatial boundaries."
"Static images are not very effective at evoking visual responses. In awake animals, images are constantly kept in motion across the retina by eye movements. In experiments in which the eyes are fixed, moving light bars and gratings, or gratings undergoing periodic light-dark reversals  are used as more effective stimuli than static images."
"Some neurons in primary visual cortex are directionally selective; they respond more strongly to stimuli moving in one direction than in the other. To streamline the discussion in this chapter, we consider only greyscale images, although the methods presented can be extended to include color. We also restrict the discussion to two-dimensional visual images, ignoring how visual responses depend on viewing distance and encode depth."
"In discussing the response properties of retinal, LGN, and V1 neurons, we do not follow the path of the visual signal, nor the historical order of experimentation, but, instead, begin with primary visual cortex and then move back to the LGN and retina. The emphasis is on properties of individual neurons, so we do not discuss encoding by populations of visually responsive neurons. For V1, this has been analyzed in terms of wavelets, a scheme for decomposing images into component pieces, as discussed in chapter 10."
"A striking feature of most visual areas in the brain, including primary visual cortex, is that the visual world is mapped onto the cortical surface in a topographic manner. This means that neighboring points in a visual image evoke activity in neighboring regions of visual cortex. The retinotopic map refers to the transformation from the coordinates of the visual world to the corresponding locations on the cortical surface."
"Figure 2,7A shows a dramatic illustration of the retinotopic map in the primary visual cortex of a monkey. The pattern on the cortex seen in figure 2,7A was produced by imaging a radioactive analog of glucose that was taken up by active neurons while a monkey viewed a visual image consisting of concentric circles and radial lines, similar to the pattern in figure 2,6B. The vertical lines correspond to the circles in the image, and the roughly horizontal lines are due to the activity evoked by the radial lines."
"The fovea is represented at the left-most pole of this piece of cortex and eccentricity increases toward the right. Azimuthal angles are positive in the lower half of the piece of cortex shown, and negative in the upper half. The three pounds of jelly-like material found within our skulls is the most complex machine on Earth and perhaps the universe."
"Its phenomenal features would not be possible without the hundreds of billions of neurons that make it up, and, importantly, the connections between those neurons. Fortunately, much is known about the properties of individual neurons and simple neuronal networks, and aspects of complex neuronal networks are beginning to be unraveled. This chapter will begin with a discussion of the neuron, the elementary node or element of the brain, and then move to a discussion of the ways in which individual neurons communicate with each other."
"What makes the nervous system such a fantastic device and distinguishes the brain from other organs of the body is not that it has 100 billion neurons, but that nerve cells are capable of communicating with each other in such a highly structured manner as to form neuronal networks. To understand neural networks, it is necessary to understand the ways in which one neuron communicates with another through synaptic connections and the process called synaptic transmission. Synaptic transmission comes in two basic flavors: excitation and inhibition."
"Just a few interconnected neurons  can perform sophisticated tasks such as mediate reflexes, process sensory information, generate locomotion and mediate learning and memory. More complex networks  consist of multiple imbedded microcircuits. Macrocircuits mediate higher brain functions such as object recognition and cognition."
"So, multiple levels of networks are ubiquitous in the nervous system. Networks are also prevalent within neurons. These nanocircuits constitute the underlying biochemical machinery for mediating key neuronal properties such as learning and memory and the genesis of neuronal rhythmicity."
"The 100 billion neurons in the brain share a number of common features . Neurons are different from most other cells in the body in that they are polarized and have distinct morphological regions, each with specific functions. Dendrites are the region where one neuron receives connections from other neurons."
The cell body or soma contains the nucleus and the other organelles necessary for cellular function. The axon is a key component of nerve cells over which information is transmitted from one part of the neuron  to the terminal regions of the neuron. Axons can be rather long extending up to a meter or so in some human sensory and motor nerve cells.
The synapse is the terminal region of the axon and it is here where one neuron forms a connection with another and conveys information through the process of synaptic transmission. The aqua-colored neuron in Figure 1  is referred to as the postsynaptic neuron. The tan-colored terminal to the left is consequently referred to as the presynaptic neuron.
"One neuron can receive contacts from many different neurons. Figure 1  shows an example of three presynaptic neurons contacting the one tan-colored postsynaptic neuron, but it has been estimated that one neuron can receive contacts from up to 10,000 other cells. Consequently, the potential complexity of the networks is vast."
"Similarly, any one neuron can contact up to 10,000 postsynaptic cells. . Figure 1  also shows an expanded view of the synapse."
"Note that the presynaptic cell is not directly connected to the postsynaptic cell. The two are separated by a gap known as the synaptic cleft. Therefore, to communicate with the postsynaptic cell, the presynaptic neuron needs to release a chemical messenger."
That messenger is found within the neurotransmitter-containing vesicles . An action potential that invades the presynaptic terminal causes these vesicles to fuse with the inner surface of the presynaptic membrane and release their contents through a process called exocytosis. The released transmitter diffuses across the gap between the pre- and the postsynaptic cell and very rapidly reaches the postsynaptic side of the synapse where it binds to specialized receptors that “recognize” the transmitter.
"The binding to the receptors leads to a change in the permeability of ion channels in the membrane and in turn a change in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron known as a postsynaptic synaptic potential . So signaling among neurons is associated with changes in the electrical properties of neurons. To understand neurons and neuronal circuits, it is necessary to understand the electrical properties of nerve cells."
Resting potentials. Figure 2 shows an example of an idealized nerve cell. Placed in the extracellular medium is a microelectrode.
"A microelectrode is nothing more than a small piece of glass capillary tubing that is stretched under heat to produce a very fine tip, on the order of 1 micron in diameter. The microelectrode is filled with a conducting solution and then connected to a suitable recording device such as an oscilloscope or chart recorder. With the electrode outside the cell in the extracellular medium, zero potential is recorded because the extracellular medium is isopotential."
"If, however, the electrode penetrates the cell such that the tip of the electrode is now inside the cell, a sharp deflection is seen on the recording device. A potential of about -60 millivolts inside negative with respect to the outside is recorded. This potential is called the resting potential and is constant for indefinite periods of time in the absence of any stimulation."
"If the electrode is removed, a potential of zero is recorded again. Resting potentials are not just characteristics of nerve cells; all cells in the body have resting potentials. What distinguishes nerve cells and other excitable membranes  is that they are capable of changing their resting potential."
"In the case of nerve cells, for integrating information and transmitting information, whereas, in the case of muscle cells, for producing muscle contractions. Action potentials. Figure 3 shows another sketch of an idealized neuron."
"This neuron has been impaled with one electrode to measure the resting potential and a second electrode called the stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode is connected through a switch to a battery. If the battery is oriented such that the positive pole is connected to the switch, closing the switch will make the inside of the cell somewhat more positive depending upon the size of the battery."
"Figure 3 is an animation in which the switch is repeatedly opened and closed and each time it is closed a larger battery is applied to the circuit. Initially, the switch closure produces only small depolarizations. However, the potentials become larger and eventually the depolarization is sufficiently large to trigger an action potential, also known as a spike or an impulse."
The action potential is associated with a very rapid depolarization to achieve a peak value of about +40 mV in just 0. 5 milliseconds . The peak is followed by an equally rapid repolarization phase.
"The voltage at which the depolarization becomes sufficient to trigger an action potential is called the threshold. If a larger battery is used to generate a suprathreshold depolarization, a single action potential is still generated and the amplitude of that action potential is the same as the action potential trigged by a just-threshold stimulus. The simple recording in Figure 3 illustrates two very important features of action potentials."
"First, they are elicited in an all-or-nothing fashion. Either an action potential is elicited with stimuli at or above threshold, or an action potential is not elicited. Second, action potentials are very brief events of only about several milliseconds in duration."
Initiating an action potential is somewhat analogous to applying match to a fuse. A certain temperature is needed to ignite the fuse . A match that generates a greater amount of heat than the threshold temperature will not cause the fuse to burn any brighter or faster.
"Just as action potentials are elicited in an all-or-nothing fashion, they are also propagated in an all-or-nothing fashion. Once an action potential is initiated in one region of a neuron such as the cell body, that action potential will propagate along the axon  and ultimately invade the synapse where it can initiate the process of synaptic transmission. In the example in Figure 3, only a single action potential was generated because the duration of each of the two suprathreshold stimuli was so brief that sufficient time was only available to initiate a single action potential ."
"But, as shown in the animations of Figure 4, longer-duration stimuli can lead to the initiation of multiple action potentials, the frequency of which is dependent on the intensity of the stimulus. Therefore, it is evident that the nervous system encodes information not in terms of the changes in the amplitude of action potentials, but rather in their frequency. This is a very universal property."
"The greater the intensity of a mechanical stimulus to a touch receptor, the greater the number of action potentials; the greater the amount of stretch to a muscle stretch receptor, the greater the number of action potentials; the greater the intensity of a light, the greater the number of action potentials that is transmitted to the central nervous system. Similarly, in the motor system, the greater the number of action potentials in a motor neuron, the greater will be the contraction of the muscle that receives a synaptic connection from that motor neuron. Engineers call this type of information coding pulse frequency modulation."
Figure 5 illustrates three neurons. The one colored green will be referred to as an excitatory neuron for reasons that will become clear shortly. It makes a connection to the postsynaptic neuron colored blue.
The traces below  illustrate the consequences of initiating an action potential in the green neuron. That action potential in the presynaptic neuron leads to a decrease in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. The membrane potential changes from its resting value of about -60 millivolts to a more depolarized state.
"This potential is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential . It is “excitatory” because it moves the membrane potential toward the threshold and it is “postsynaptic” because it is a potential recorded on the postsynaptic side of the synapse. Generally , a single action potential in a presynaptic cell does not produce an EPSP large enough to reach threshold and trigger an action potential."
"But, if multiple action potentials are fired in the presynaptic cell, the corresponding multiple excitatory potentials can summate through a process called temporal summation to reach threshold and triggering an action potential. EPSPs can be viewed as a “go signal” to the postsynaptic neuron to transmit information through a network pathway. The red-colored neuron in Figure 5 is referred to as an inhibitory neuron."
"Like the green neuron, it also makes a synaptic contact with the blue postsynaptic neuron. It also releases a chemical transmitter messenger, but the consequences of the transmitter from the blue cell binding to receptors on the postsynaptic cell is opposite to the consequences of the transmitter released by the green neuron. The consequence of action potential in the red presynaptic neuron is to produce an increase in the membrane potential, i."
e. a hyperpolarization of the blue postsynaptic neuron. Therefore the membrane potential is farther away from threshold.
This type of potential is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential  because it tends to prevent the postsynaptic neuron from firing an action potential. This is a “stop signal” for the postsynaptic cell. So the green neuron says “go” and the red neuron says “stop”.
"Now what is the postsynaptic neuron to do? Neurons are like adding machines. They are constantly adding up the excitatory and the inhibitory synaptic input in time  and over the area of the dendrites receiving synaptic contacts , and if that summation is at or above threshold they fire an action potential."
"If the sum is below threshold, no action potential is initiated. This is a process called synaptic integration and is illustrated in Figure 5. Initially, two action potentials in the green neuron produced summating EPSPs that fired an action potential in the blue neuron."
"But, if an IPSP from the inhibitory neuron occurs just before two action potentials in the excitatory neuron, the summation of the one IPSP and the two EPSPs is below threshold and no action potential is elicited in the postsynaptic cell. The inhibitory neuron  is a way of gating or regulating the ability of an excitatory signal to fire a postsynaptic cell. As indicated earlier in the chapter, a neuron can receive contacts from up to 10,000 presynaptic neurons, and, in turn, any one neuron can contact up to 10,000 postsynaptic neurons."
"The combinatorial possibility could give rise to enormously complex neuronal circuits or network topologies, which might be very difficult to understand. But despite the potential vast complexity, much can be learned about the functioning of neuronal circuits by examining the properties of a subset of simple circuit configurations. Figure 6 illustrates some of those microcircuit or micronetwork motifs."
"Although simple, they can do much of what needs to be done by a nervous system. Feedforward excitation. Allows one neuron to relay information to its neighbor."
Long chains of these can be used to propagate information through the nervous system. Feedforward inhibition. A presynaptic cell excites an inhibitory interneuron  and that inhibitory interneuron then inhibits the next follower cell.
This is a way of shutting down or limiting excitation in a downstream neuron in a neural circuit. Convergence/Divergence. One postsynaptic cell receives convergent input from a number of different presynaptic cells and any individual neuron can make divergent connections to many different postsynaptic cells.
Divergence allows one neuron to communicate with many other neurons in a network. Convergence allows a neuron to receive input from many neurons in a network. Lateral inhibition.
"A presynaptic cell excites inhibitory interneurons and they inhibit neighboring cells in the network. As described in detail later in the Chapter, this type of circuit can be used in sensory systems to provide edge enhancement. Feedback/recurrent inhibition."
"In Panel E1, a presynaptic cell connects to a postsynaptic cell, and the postsynaptic cell in turn connects to an interneuron, which then inhibits the presynaptic cell. This circuit can limit excitation in a pathway. Some initial excitation would be shut off after the red interneuron becomes active."
"In Panel E2, each neuron in the closed chain inhibits the neuron to which it is connected. This circuit would appear to do nothing, but, as will be seen later in the Chapter, it can lead to the generation of complex patterns of spike activity. Feedback/recurrent excitation."
"In Panel F1, a presynaptic neuron excites a postsynaptic neuron and that postsynaptic neuron excites the presynaptic neuron. This type of circuit can serve a switch-like function because once the presynaptic cell is activated that activation could be perpetuated. Activation of the presynaptic neuron could switch this network on and it could stay on."
Panel F2 shows variants of feedback excitation in which a presynaptic neuron excites a postsynaptic neuron that can feedback to excite itself  or other neurons which ultimately feedback  to itself. These simple motifs are ubiquitous components of many neural circuits. Let’s examine some examples of what these networks can do.
"One of the best understood microcircuits is the circuit that mediates simple reflex behaviors. Figure 7 illustrates the circuit for the so-called knee jerk or stretch reflex. A neurologist strikes the knee with a rubber tapper, which elicits an extension of the leg."
This test is used as a simple way to examine the integrity of some of the sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord. The tap of hammer stretches the muscle and leads to the initiation of action potentials in sensory neurons within the muscle that are sensitive to stretch. The action potentials are initiated in an all-or-nothing fashion and propagate into the spinal cord where the axon splits  into two branches.
"Let’s first discuss the branch to the left that forms a synaptic connection  with an Extensor  motor neuron . The action potential in the sensory neuron invades the synaptic terminal of the sensory neuron causing the release of transmitter and subsequent excitation of the motor neuron. The stretch to the muscle leads to an action potential in the motor neuron , which then propagates out the peripheral nerve to invade the synapse at the muscle, causing the release of transmitter and an action potential in the muscle."
"The action potential in the muscle cell leads to a contraction of the muscle and an extension of the limb. So, here we have a simple feedforward excitation circuit that mediates a behavior. Now let’s examine the right branch of the axon of the sensory neuron of Figure 7."
"The action potential in the sensory neuron invades the synaptic terminal of the sensory neuron causing the release of transmitter, and subsequent excitation of the postsynaptic interneuron colored black. This neuron is called an interneuron because it is interposed between one neuron  and another neuron . The excitation of the interneuron leads to the initiation of an action and the subsequent release of transmitter from the presynaptic terminal of the interneuron , but for this branch of the circuit, the transmitter leads to an IPSP in the postsynaptic flexor  motor neuron ."
"The functional consequences of this feedforward inhibition it is to decrease the probability of the flexor motor neuron becoming active and producing an inappropriate flexion of the leg. The simplified circuit mediating the stretch reflex is summarized in Figure 8. However, the proper function of the circuit of the stretch reflex also relies on convergence and divergence."
"A single sensory has multiple branches that diverge and make synaptic connections with many individual motor neurons . Therefore, when the muscle contracts as a result of the neurologist’s tapper, it does so because multiple muscle fibers are activated simultaneously by multiple motor neurons. Also, when the muscle is stretched, not one, but multiple sensory neuron are activated and these sensory neurons all project into the spinal cord where they converge on to individual extensor motor neurons ."
"So, the stretch reflex is due to the combined effects of the activation of multiple sensory neurons and extensor motor neurons. Edge enhancement. Lateral inhibition is very important for processing sensory information."
"One example is a phenomenon in the visual system called edge enhancement. Figure 9 illustrates two bands, a dark gray band on the left, and a light gray band on the right. Although the dark band and the light band are of uniform luminance throughout each field, a close examination reveals that the light gray band appears somewhat lighter at the border of the dark gray band than it is in the other regions of the field."
"In contrast, the dark gray band appears somewhat darker at the border than at other regions of the dark field. This is a phenomenon of edge enhancement, which helps the visual system to extract important information from visual scenes. Edge enhancement is mediated, at least in part by lateral inhibition in the retina."
"Let’s first consider a circuit without lateral inhibition . Light falls on the retina  and the intensity can be described by the step-like gradient . As a simplification, assume that the dark gray region has an intensity of five units and the light gray region has an intensity of ten units."
"The gradient of light activates the photoreceptors and the photoreceptors make synaptic connections to second-order neurons. Assume that the light intensity of 5 units leads to 5 spikes/s and the light intensity of 10 units leads to 10 spikes/s  in the photo receptors, and that the synaptic strength is sufficient  so that the light intensity of 5 units leads to 5 spikes/s and the light intensity of 10 units leads to 10 spikes/s  respectively in the second-order neurons. If no further processing of the information occurred, the gradient that is perceived would be exactly the same as the gradient of the light intensity ."
But that is not what is perceived and lateral inhibition explains the difference. Now consider the expanded circuit with lateral inhibition . Each one of the photoreceptors makes inhibitory synaptic connections with its neighboring second-order neuron.
"The strength of the inhibition  is less than the strength of the excitation . Before looking at the border, consider the output of the circuit at the uniform areas of the each field. Far to the right side of the border all of the cells are receiving the same excitation and the same inhibition."
"Without lateral inhibition, the light intensity of 10 units would produce 10 spikes/s in the second-order-neuron. But because of the inhibitory connection from neighbor neurons to the right and left, the output is reduced to 6 spikes/s. The same is true for cells far to the left of the border but the magnitude of the excitation is less and correspondingly the magnitude of the inhibition is less."
"The key processing occurs at the border or edge. Note that the neuron just to the right of the border receives the same inhibition from the neuron to its right but receives less inhibition from the neuron to its left on the other side of the border. Therefore, it receives more net excitation and it has an output of 7 spikes/s rather than the 6 spikes/s of its neighbor to the right."
"Now look at the neuron to the left of the border. It receives weak inhibition from its neighbor to the left, but stronger inhibition from its neighbor to the right on the other side of the border. Therefore, it receives less net excitation and it has an output of 2 spikes/s rather than the 3 spikes/s of its neighbor to the left."
So as a result of lateral inhibition the information transmitted to the nervous system and the gradient that is perceived would be a version of the original one with an enhanced border or edge ! Mach bands. The simple retinal circuit with lateral inhibition can account the phenomenon of edge enhancement. It can also account for a visual illusion known as Mach bands.
Figure 11 illustrates a gradient of light and dark vertical bands and across these bands is a thin horizontal line. It appears as though the horizontal line has an uneven distribution of intensities with it being darker in the region of the light vertical gradients and lighter in the region of the dark vertical gradients. This is a visual illusion.
The illusion can be revealed by placing a mask over the vertical gradient. Now you can see that the horizontal bar has uniform intensity. It is perceived darker in some regions because the cells in the retina that respond to the darker region of the horizontal bar are strongly inhibited by the cells responding to the bright region of the vertical band.
"In contrast, the bar is perceived brighter in some regions because the cells in the retina that respond to the lighter region of the horizontal bar are only weakly inhibited by the cells responding to the dark region of the vertical band. Feedback inhibition in microcircuits. Feedback inhibition plays a general role in damping excitation through a neural circuit."
A classic example is the Renshaw cell in the spinal cord. The axon of a spinal motor neuron branches. One branch innervates muscle as described earlier  and the other branch makes an excitatory synaptic connection with an interneuron called the Renshaw cell.
"The interneuron in turn inhibits the motor neuron, thereby closing the loop. Another example of feedback inhibition is found in the hippocampus. CA3-type pyramidal cells make excitatory connections to basket cells and the basket cells feedback to inhibit the CA3 cells."
The term recurrent inhibition is applied to simple feedback inhibition circuits such as the Renshaw circuit in the spinal cord and the basket cell circuit in the hippocampus. Feedback inhibition in nanocircuits. Feedback inhibition is not only prevalent in many neuronal circuits; it is also prevalent in biochemical circuits.
Here it can serve as a substrate for generating oscillations. These can cover multiple time scales from seconds to days depending on the molecular components of the circuit. Endogenous bursting behavior in neurons.
"The idealized neuron described earlier in the Chapter was silent in the absence of stimulation . However, some neurons fire action potentials in the absence of stimulation, and, in some cases, the firing patterns can exhibit a bursting pattern in which successive high frequency spike activity is followed by quiescent periods. Such neuronal properties could be important for generating rhythmic behaviors such as respiration."
"Figure 12 is an example of a recording from an invertebrate neuron that has an endogenous bursting rhythm. This particular neuron is called the parabolic burster because the nature of the inter-spike intervals being long in the beginning and end of the burst cycle, but very brief in the middle of the cycle. The cell fires a burst of action potentials and then becomes silent, but soon another burst occurs and this process continues indefinitely about every ten to fifteen seconds."
"The bursting occurs even if the neuron is surgically removed from the ganglion and placed in culture so there are no synaptic connections from other neurons. So a neuronal network is not necessary for this rhythm - it is endogenous. But, it does involve a nanocircuit within the cell."
"Figure 13A illustrates a very simplified version of that network that emphasizes the key principle of operation. Critical for this network function is a channel in the membrane , which is permeable to Ca2+. Because the concentration of Ca2+ is relatively high in the extracellular medium and low inside the cell, Ca2+ will move down its concentration gradient and in so doing will depolarize the cell."
"Eventually, the depolarization reaches threshold and the cell begins to fire. The firing leads to additional influx of Ca2+  and accumulation of Ca2+ within the cell. The key step is that the accumulation of Ca2+ inhibits  the further influx of calcium and terminates the burst."
The burst remains terminated as long as the levels of intracellular Ca2+ remain elevated. But the levels of Ca2+ do not remain elevated for long. They are reduced by intracellular buffers and removed from the cell by pumps .
"As intracellular levels of Ca2+ are reduced, the inhibition of the channel is removed  and the neuron begins to depolarize again and another burst is initiated. Essentially, what is seen here at the nanonetwork level is a recapitulation of a feedback inhibitory network . An initial excitatory process leads to activation of an inhibitory process, which feeds back to shut off the excitatory process."
"In such a network, oscillations will result if the excitatory drive is continuous, but the inhibitory process wanes in its effectiveness. Circadian rhythms. A second example of feedback inhibition is the nanocircuit for the gene regulation that underlies circadian rhythms."
"The vertebrate circadian rhythm is due to the operation of a group of neurons in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is located just above the optic nerve. Those neurons have profound effects on both hormonal release such as melatonin, cortisol, as well as on autonomic functions such as body temperature . Despite the profound effects of this oscillator, its operation reduces to a very simple circuit, and indeed not a neural circuit, but rather another nanocircuit."
"The basic mechanism seems to be conserved across all animal species including man. Figure 15 is a simplified schematic diagram of the basic components. Several genes are involved but the core mechanism involves a gene called per, where per is for period."
This gene was first identified from the fruit fly Drosophila but is also present in vertebrates. The per gene leads to the production of per messenger RNA. The per mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it leads to the synthesis of PER protein.
"PER diffuses or is transported back into the nucleus where it represses the further transcription of the per gene. Conceptually, this system is very similar to that of the mechanism for the bursting neuron discussed above. The gene is activated, it produces the mRNA and the protein, and the protein feedbacks to inhibit the gene expression."
But how does the cycle repeat itself? The key mechanism is degradation of the PER. PER protein is degraded and it is degraded over a 24 hour period.
"So as the PER protein is degraded the inhibition or repression is removed  allowing this gene to start making messenger RNA and protein all over again. So once this cycle begins, it is repeated over and over again at a 24 hour period. This is the core mechanism underlying circadian rhythms and the powerful affects that they have on a number of different physiological systems."
"Basically, our circadian rhythms all start with a molecular feedback inhibition network. Feedback inhibition in ring circuits. Recurrent inhibition can, at least in principle, explain the generation of complex motor patters, an example of which is quadrupedal locomotion."
"Quadrupedal location is interesting because quadrupeds are capable of not only moving their four legs, but generating different types of cycles of activity called gaits. Figure 16 illustrates four gaits. The first panel is a walk ."
"The sequence begins with extension of the left front limb. This is followed by extensions of the right hind limb, the right front limb and the left hind limb. In the trot  , the left front and right hind limbs are in phase with each other and 180 degrees out of phase with the right front and left hind limbs."
"In the bound   the left front and right front limbs are in phase, but 180 degrees out of phase with the left hind and rear hind limbs. The gallop   is a variant of the bound in which there is a slight phase difference between the right and left front limbs and rear limbs. How does the nervous system generate these gaits?"
"And, are separate neuronal circuits necessary for each one? Unfortunately, neuroscientists do not know the answers to these questions, but it is instructive to examine some possibilities. This is an approach in a field of neuroscience called Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience."
"One way to generate a gait is illustrated in Figure 17. Take four individual neurons each with endogenous bursting activity like the one illustrated previously in Figure 12, and assign activity in each one of these neurons to the control of a specific limb. The neurons could be “started” so that they have the appropriate phase relationships to generate a gait such as the bound illustrated in Figure 16."
The difficulty would be in starting the neurons at exactly the precise time. Another problem would be slight “drifts” in the oscillatory periods of the four independent neurons that over time would cause the pattern to become uncoordinated . This dog is not going to win any races and it is probably not going to be able to walk.
"So clearly the neurons need to be coupled. One way of doing this is to use a recurrent inhibition circuit consisting of four coupled neurons to form a so called “ring” circuit where each neuron in the circuit has endogenous bursting activity and each neuron is coupled to the next with an inhibitory synaptic connection . To obtain the correct phase relationships for gaits, rather than assigning Neuron 3 to be the right front, it is assigned to control the right hind limb, and Neuron 4 is assigned to control the right front limb  ."
"When implemented with a computer simulation, this single circuit is capable of generating quadrupedal gates. Moreover, the same circuit, with just small changes in the properties of the individual neurons, can generate each of the four gaits illustrated in Figure 17 . This result indicates an important point about neural networks."
"In order to understand them it is necessary to understand not just the topology of the network, but also the nature of the connections between the neurons , as well as the properties of the individual nodes . Also, this simulation illustrates a phenomenon called dynamic reconfiguration. It is not necessary to have four different networks to generate these four different gaits - it can all be done with a single circuit."
The actual circuit generating quadrapedal gaits is more complex than that of Fig. 19. The interested reader is referred to a recent review by Ole Keihn .
Recurrent excitation in nanocircuits and microcircuits appears to be critical for learning and memory processes. Learning involves changes in the biophysical properties of neurons and changes in synaptic strength. Accumulating evidence indicates positive feedback within biochemical cascades and gene networks is an important component for the induction and maintenance of these changes.
"Moreover, recurrent excitation is found in at least some microcircuits involved in memory processes. A prime example is found within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Figure 21 illustrates key features of the CA3 recurrent excitatory circuit."
"Six different hippocampal pyramidal neurons are labeled as U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. Each one of these neurons receives a synaptic connection from the presynaptic neurons labeled a, b, c, d, e, and f. These presynaptic neurons can be either active or inactive with a 0 and black color representing an inactive neuron and a 1 and a green color indicating an active one."
"An important aspect of this circuitry is that the synaptic connections from the input pathway are sufficiently strong to activate  the pyramidal neuron to which they are connected. For example, if neuron a is activated, neuron Z will be activated, which is represented as a 1 on the Output bar. This topology is nothing more than feedforward excitation."
"The reciprocal excitation makes this circuit special. For example, neuron Z and the other pyramidal neurons have axon collaterals that feedback to connect with themselves. But, they not only make a connection with themselves."
"Each neuron makes a connection with each of the five other pyramidal neurons in the circuit. So every pyramidal receives convergent information from all the other cells in the network, and, in turn, the output of each pyramidal neuron diverges to make synaptic connections with all the other pyramidal neurons in the circuit. The matrix of connectivity consists of 36 elements."
"In order for this network to learn anything, a synaptic plasticity learning rule needs to be embedded into the circuit. One that is widely accepted is known as the Hebb Learning Rule. Essentially, it states that a synapse will change its strength if that synapse is active  and, at the same time, the postsynaptic cell is active."
"The combination of this learning rule and the recurrent excitatory circuit leads to some interesting emergent properties. For example, if neuron Z is activated by input a, the strength of its connection to itself  will change as indicated by the green colored synapse on Figure 21 . However, synapse 1 will not be the only synapse that will be strengthened."
"For example, synapse 13 will also be strengthened because neuron Z was active at the same time neuron X was activated by input c. In contrast, synapse 7 is not strengthened because neuron Y was not active at the same time as neuron Z. The net effect of this convergence and divergence and the learning rule is that an initial activity input pattern will be stored as changes in the elements of the connectivity matrix."
This circuit has therefore been called an auto-association network. An important concept here is that the ”memory” is not in any one synapse; it is distributed in the network. Considerable progress has been made in understanding how different simple neural networks are involved in information processing and mediating behavior.
Feedforward excitation and feedforward inhibition mediate reflex behaviors. Lateral inhibition is important for edge enhancement. Recurrent excitation is an important mechanism for memory.
Recurrent inhibition can be important for generating locomotor behavior. Convergence and divergence are embedded in these microcircuits. The same kinds of network motifs are recapitulated in biochemical and gene networks.
"The next level of understanding is at the level of the neuronal networks that mediate more complex, so called higher-order functions of the brain. Their understanding is becoming possible through the use of electrophysiological and optical recording techniques, and modern imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging  and diffusion tensor imaging . fMRI allows investigators to identify areas of the brain that are engaged in cognitive tasks, whereas DTI allows visualization of pathways linking one brain region to another."
"Figure 22  is a side view of the human brain showing the pathways interconnecting cortical areas revealed using DTI!. Object recognition is an example where progress is being made in understanding macrocircuits. As illustrated in Figure 23, processing of visual information starts in the retina and then engages multiple cortical regions such as the occipital cortex and the temporal cortex."
"Within this macrocircuit are modules that extract higher-order information. Each module presumably involves hundreds, if not thousands of individual microcircuits. The challenge for the future is to determine how these modules work and how they interact with other modules."
"Although feedforward connections are present, feedback connections and lateral connections are widespread. The challenge is enormous but perhaps achievement of the goal will be facilitated by taking advantage of what has been learned about the principles of nanocircuits and microcircuits. To understand the macrocircuits it will be necessary to know more than the topology of the network interconnections."
"It will be necessary to know how each module functions and about the dynamics of the inter module connections. Theories of the encoding and transmission of information in the nervous system go back to the Greek physician Galen , who suggested a hydraulic mechanism by which muscles contract because fluid flowing into them from hollow nerves. The basic theory held for centuries and was further elaborated by René Descartes  who suggested that animal spirits flowed from the brain through nerves and then to muscles to produce movements ."
"A major paradigm shift occurred with the pioneering work of Luigi Galvani who found in 1794 that nerve and muscle could be activated by charged electrodes and suggested that the nervous system functions via electrical signaling . However, there was debate among scholars whether the electricity was within nerves and muscle or whether the nerves and muscles were simply responding to the harmful electric shock via some intrinsic nonelectric mechanism. The issue was not resolved until the 1930s with the development of modern electronic amplifiers and recording devices that allowed the electrical signals to be recorded."
One example is the pioneering work of H. K. Hartline 80 years ago on electrical signaling in the horseshoe crab Limulus .
"Electrodes were placed on the surface of an optic nerve. Then 1-s duration flashes of light of varied intensities were presented to the eye; first dim light, then brighter lights. Very dim lights produced no changes in the activity, but brighter lights produced small repetitive spike-like events."
"These spike-like events are called action potentials, nerve impulses, or sometimes simply spikes. Action potentials are the basic events the nerve cells use to transmit information from one place to another. The recordings in the figure above illustrate three very important features of nerve action potentials."
"First, the nerve action potential has a short duration . Second, nerve action potentials are elicited in an all-or-nothing fashion. Third, nerve cells code the intensity of information by the frequency of action potentials."
"When the intensity of the stimulus is increased, the size of the action potential does not become larger. Rather, the frequency or the number of action potentials increases. In general, the greater the intensity of a stimulus,  the greater the number of action potentials elicited."
"Similarly, for the motor system, the greater the number of action potentials in a motor neuron, the greater the intensity of the contraction of a muscle that is innervated by that motor neuron. Action potentials are of great importance to the functioning of the brain since they propagate information in the nervous system to the central nervous system and propagate commands initiated in the central nervous system to the periphery. Consequently, it is necessary to understand thoroughly their properties."
"To answer the questions of how action potentials are initiated and propagated, we need to record the potential between the inside and outside of nerve cells using intracellular recording techniques. The potential difference across a nerve cell membrane can be measured with a microelectrode whose tip is so small  that it can penetrate the cell without producing any damage. When the electrode is in the bath  there is no potential recorded because the bath is isopotential."
"If the microelectrode is carefully inserted into the cell, there is a sharp change in potential. The reading of the voltmeter instantaneously changes from 0 mV, to reading a potential difference of -60 mV inside the cell with respect to the outside. The potential that is recorded when a living cell is impaled with a microelectrode is called the resting potential, and varies from cell to cell."
"Here it is shown to be -60 mV, but can range between -80 mV and -40 mV, depending on the particular type of nerve cell. In the absence of any stimulation, the resting potential is generally constant. It is also possible to record and study the action potential."
"Figure 1. 3 illustrates an example in which a neuron has already been impaled with one microelectrode , which is connected to a voltmeter. The electrode records a resting potential of -60 mV."
The cell has also been impaled with a second electrode called the stimulating electrode. This electrode is connected to a battery and a device that can monitor the amount of current  that flows through the electrode. Changes in membrane potential are produced by closing the switch and by systematically changing both the size and polarity of the battery.
"If the negative pole of the battery is connected to the inside of the cell as in Figure 1. 3A, an instantaneous change in the amount of current will flow through the stimulating electrode, and the membrane potential becomes transiently more negative. This result should not be surprising."
The negative pole of the battery makes the inside of the cell more negative than it was before. A change in potential that increases the polarized state of a membrane is called a hyperpolarization. The cell is more polarized than it was normally.
Use yet a larger battery and the potential becomes even larger. The resultant hyperpolarizations are graded functions of the magnitude of the stimuli used to produce them. Now consider the case in which the positive pole of the battery is connected to the electrode .
"When the positive pole of the battery is connected to the electrode, the potential of the cell becomes more positive when the switch is closed . Such potentials are called depolarizations. The polarized state of the membrane is decreased."
"Larger batteries produce even larger depolarizations. Again, the magnitude of the responses are proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli. However, an unusual event occurs when the magnitude of the depolarization reaches a level of membrane potential called the threshold."
"A totally new type of signal is initiated; the action potential. Note that if the size of the battery is increased even more, the amplitude of the action potential is the same as the previous one . The process of eliciting an action potential in a nerve cell is analogous to igniting a fuse with a heat source."
A certain minimum temperature  is necessary. Temperatures less than the threshold fail to ignite the fuse. Temperatures greater than the threshold ignite the fuse just as well as the threshold temperature and the fuse does not burn any brighter or hotter.
"If the suprathreshold current stimulus is long enough, however, a train of action potentials will be elicited. In general, the action potentials will continue to fire as long as the stimulus continues, with the frequency of firing being proportional to the magnitude of the stimulus . Action potentials are not only initiated in an all-or-nothing fashion, but they are also propagated in an all-or-nothing fashion."
"An action potential initiated in the cell body of a motor neuron in the spinal cord will propagate in an undecremented fashion all the way to the synaptic terminals of that motor neuron. Again, the situation is analogous to a burning fuse. Once the fuse is ignited, the flame will spread to its end."
"The action potential consists of several components . The threshold is the value of the membrane potential which, if reached, leads to the all-or-nothing initiation of an action potential. The initial or rising phase of the action potential is called the depolarizing phase or the upstroke."
The region of the action potential between the 0 mV level and the peak amplitude is the overshoot. The return of the membrane potential to the resting potential is called the repolarization phase. There is also a phase of the action potential during which time the membrane potential can be more negative than the resting potential.
"This phase of the action potential is called the undershoot or the hyperpolarizing afterpotential. In Figure 1. 4, the undershoots of the action potentials do not become more negative than the resting potential because they are ""riding"" on the constant depolarizing stimulus."
"Before examining the ionic mechanisms of action potentials, it is first necessary to understand the ionic mechanisms of the resting potential. The two phenomena are intimately related. The story of the resting potential goes back to the early 1900's when Julius Bernstein suggested that the resting potential  was equal to the potassium equilibrium potential ."
"Where The key to understanding the resting potential is the fact that ions are distributed unequally on the inside and outside of cells, and that cell membranes are selectively permeable to different ions. K+ is particularly important for the resting potential. The membrane is highly permeable to K+."
"In addition, the inside of the cell has a high concentration of K+  and the outside of the cell has a low concentration of K+ . Thus, K+ will naturally move by diffusion from its region of high concentration to its region of low concentration. Consequently, the positive K+ ions leaving the inner surface of the membrane leave behind some negatively charged ions."
"That negative charge attracts the positive charge of the K+ ion that is leaving and tends to ""pull it back"". Thus, there will be an electrical force directed inward that will tend to counterbalance the diffusional force directed outward. Eventually, an equilibrium will be established; the concentration force moving K+ out will balance the electrical force holding it in."
The potential at which that balance is achieved is called the Nernst Equilibrium Potential. An experiment to test Bernstein's hypothesis that the membrane potential is equal to the Nernst Equilibrium Potential  is illustrated to the left. The K+ concentration outside the cell was systematically varied while the membrane potential was measured.
"Also shown is the line that is predicted by the Nernst Equation. The experimentally measured points are very close to this line. Moreover, because of the logarithmic relationship in the Nernst equation, a change in concentration of K+ by a factor of 10 results in a 60 mV change in potential."
"Note, however, that there are some deviations in the figure at left from what is predicted by the Nernst equation. Thus, one cannot conclude that Vm = EK. Such deviations indicate that another ion is also involved in generating the resting potential."
That ion is Na+. The high concentration of Na+ outside the cell and relatively low concentration inside the cell results in a chemical  driving force for Na+ influx. There is also an electrical driving force because the inside of the cell is negative and this negativity attracts the positive sodium ions.
"Consequently, if the cell has a small permeability to sodium, Na+ will move across the membrane and the membrane potential would be more depolarized than would be expected from the K+ equilibrium potential. When a membrane is permeable to two different ions, the Nernst equation can no longer be used to precisely determine the membrane potential. It is possible, however, to apply the GHK equation."
"This equation describes the potential across a membrane that is permeable to both Na+ and K+. Note that α is the ratio of Na+ permeability  to K+ permeability . Note also that if the permeability of the membrane to Na+ is 0, then alpha in the GHK is 0, and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation reduces to the Nernst equilibrium potential for K+."
"If the permeability of the membrane to Na+ is very high and the potassium permeability is very low, the [Na+] terms become very large, dominating the equation compared to the [K+] terms, and the GHK equation reduces to the Nernst equilibrium potential for Na+. If the GHK equation is applied to the same data in Figure 1. 5, there is a much better fit."
The value of alpha needed to obtain this good fit was 0. 01. This means that the potassium K+ permeability is 100 times the Na+ permeability.
"In summary, the resting potential is due not only to the fact that there is a high permeability to K+. There is also a slight permeability to Na+, which tends to make the membrane potential slightly more positive than it would have been if the membrane were permeable to K+ alone. Click here to go to the interactive Membrane Potential Laboratory to experiment with the effects of altering external or internal potassium ion concentration and membrane permeability to sodium and potassium ions."
"Predictions are made using the Nernst and the Goldman, Hodgkin, Katz equations. Na+ is critical for the action potential in nerve cells. As shown in Figure 2."
"1, action potentials are repeatedly initiated as the extracellular concentration of Na+ is modified. As the concentration of sodium in the extracellular solution is reduced, the action potentials become smaller. However, there are some deviations between what is measured and what is predicted by the Nernst equation."
"Why? One reason for the deviation is the continued K+ permeability. If there is continued K+ permeability, the membrane potential will never reach its ideal value  because the diffusion of K+ ions tends to make the cell negative."
This point can be understood with the aid of the GHK equation. An action potential is bounded by a region bordered on one extreme by the K+ equilibrium potential  and on the other extreme by the Na+ equilibrium potential . The resting potential is -60 mV.
"Note that the resting potential is not equal to the K+ equilibrium potential because, as discussed previously, there is a small resting Na+ permeability that makes the cell slightly more positive than EK. In principle, any point along the trajectory of action potential can be obtained simply by varying alpha in the GHK equation. If alpha is very large, the Na+ terms dominate, and according to the GHK equation, the membrane potential will move towards the Na+ equilibrium potential."
"The peak of the action potentials approaches but does not quite reach ENa, because the membrane retains its permeability to K+. How is it possible for a cell to initially have a resting potential of -60 mV and then, in response to some stimulus , change in less than one millisecond to having a potential of approximately +40 mV? In the 1950's, Hodgkin and Huxley, two British neurobiologists, provided a hypothesis for this transition."
They suggested that the properties of some Na+ channels in nerve cells  were unique in that these channels were normally closed but could be opened by a depolarization. This simple hypothesis of voltage-dependent Na+ channels goes a long way toward explaining the initiation of the action potential. Suppose a small depolarization causes some of the Na+ channels to open.
"The key point is that the increase in Na+ permeability would produce a greater depolarization, which will lead to an even greater number of Na+ channels opening and the membrane potential becoming even more depolarized. Once some critical level is reached a positive feedback or regenerative cycle will be initiated, causing the membrane potential to depolarize rapidly from -60 mV to a value approaching the Na+ equilibrium potential. In order to test the Na+ hypothesis for the initiation of the action potential, it is necessary to stabilize the membrane potential at a number of different levels and measure the permeability at those potentials."
"An electronic device known as a voltage-clamp amplifier can ""clamp"" or stabilize the membrane potential to any desired level and measure the resultant current required for that stabilization. The amount of current necessary to stabilize the potential can then be used to quantify membrane permeability. Hodgkin and Huxley clamped the membrane potential to various levels and measured the changes in Na+ conductances ."
"The more the cell is depolarized, the greater is the Na+ conductance. Thus, the experiment provided support for the existence of voltage-dependent Na+ channels. Figure 2."
"4 also indicates an important property of the voltage-dependent Na+ channels. Note that the permeability increases rapidly and then, despite the fact that the membrane potential is clamped, the permeability decays back to its initial level. This phenomenon is called inactivation."
"The Na+ channels begin to close, even in the continued presence of the depolarization. Inactivation contributes to the repolarization of the action potential. However, inactivation is not enough by itself to account fully for the repolarization."
"In addition to voltage-dependent changes in Na+ permeability, there are voltage-dependent changes in K+ permeability. These changes can be measured with the voltage-clamp technique as well. The figure shown to above indicates the changes in K+ conductance as well as the Na+ conductance."
"There are two important points. First, just as there are channels in the membrane that are permeable to Na+ that are normally closed but then open in response to a voltage, there are also channels in the membrane that are selectively permeable to K+. These K+ channels are normally closed, but open in response to depolarization."
"Second, a major difference between the changes in the K+ channels and the changes in the Na+ channels is that the K+ channels are slower to activate or open. Note that the return of the conductance at the end of the pulse is not the process of inactivation. With the removal of the pulse, the activated channels are deactivated."
"Some initial depolarization  will begin to open the Na+ channels. The increase in the Na+ influx leads to a further depolarization. A positive feedback cycle rapidly moves the membrane potential toward its peak value, which is close but not equal to the Na+ equilibrium potential."
"Two processes which contribute to repolarization at the peak of the action potential are then engaged. First, the Na+ conductance starts to decline due to inactivation. As the Na+ conductance decreases, another feedback cycle is initiated, but this one is a downward cycle."
"Sodium conductance decreases, the membrane potential begins to repolarize, and the Na+ channels that are open and not yet inactivated are deactivated and close. Second, the K+ conductance increases. Initially, there is very little change in the K+ conductance because these channels are slow to open, but by the peak of the action potential, the K+ conductance begins to increase significantly and a second force contributes to repolarization."
"As the result of these two forces, the membrane potential rapidly returns to the resting potential. At the time it reaches -60 mV, the Na+ conductance has returned to its initial value. Nevertheless, the membrane potential becomes more negative ."
"The key to understanding the hyperpolarizing afterpotential is in the slowness of the K+ channels. Just as the K+ channels are slow to open , they are also slow to close . Once the membrane potential starts to repolarize, the K+ channels begin to close because they sense the voltage."
"However, even though the membrane potential has returned to -60 mV, some of the voltage-dependent K+ channels remain open. Thus, the membrane potential will be more negative than it was initially. Eventually, these K+ channels close, and the membrane potential returns to -60 mV."
"Why does the cell go through these elaborate mechanisms to generate an action potential with a short duration? Recall how information is coded in the nervous system. If the action potential was about one msec in duration, the frequency of action potentials could change from once a second to a thousand a second."
"Therefore, short action potentials provide the nerve cell with the potential for a large dynamic range of signaling. Some chemical agents can selectively block voltage-dependent membrane channels. Tetrodotoxin , which comes from the Japanese puffer fish, blocks the voltage-dependent changes in Na+ permeability, but has no effect on the voltage-dependent changes in K+ permeability."
"This observation indicates that the Na+ and K+ channels are unique; one of these can be selectively blocked and not affect the other. Another agent, tetraethylammonium , has no effect on the voltage-dependent changes in Na+ permeability, but it completely abolishes the voltage-dependent changes in K+ permeability. Use these two agents  to test your understanding of the ionic mechanisms of the action potential."
What effect would treating an axon with TTX have on an action potential? An action potential would not occur because an action potential in an axon cannot be initiated without voltage-dependent Na+ channels. How would TEA affect the action potential?
"It would be longer and would not have an undershoot. In the presence of TEA the initial phase of the action potential is identical, but note that it is much longer and does not have an after-hyperpolarization. There is a repolarization phase, but now the repolarization is due to the process of Na+ inactivation alone."
"Note that in the presence of TEA, there is no change in the resting potential. The channels in the membrane that endow the cell with the resting potential are different from the ones that are opened by voltage. They are not blocked by TEA."
"TEA only affects the voltage-dependent changes in K+ permeability. It is easy to receive the impression that there is a ""gush"" of Na+ that comes into the cell with each action potential. Although, there is some influx of Na+, it is minute compared to the intracellular concentration of Na+."
"The influx is insufficient to make any noticeable change in the intracellular concentration of Na+. Therefore, the Na+ equilibrium potential does not change during or after an action potential. For any individual action potential, the amount of Na+ that comes into the cell and the amount of K+ that leaves are insignificant and have no effect on the bulk concentrations."
"However, without some compensatory mechanism, over the long-term , Na+ influx and K+ efflux would begin to alter the concentrations and the resultant Na+ and K+ equilibrium potentials. The Na+-K+ pumps in nerve cells provide for the long-term maintenance of these concentration gradients. They keep the intracellular concentrations of K+ high and the Na+ low, and thereby maintain the Na+ equilibrium potential and the K+ equilibrium potential."
"The pumps are necessary for the long-term maintenance of the ""batteries"" so that resting potentials and action potentials can be supported. So far, two basic classes of channels, voltage-dependent or voltage-gated channels and voltage-independent channels, have been considered. Voltage-dependent channels can be further divided based on their permeation properties into voltage-dependent Na+ channels and voltage-dependent K+ channels."
"There are also voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels . Indeed, there are multiple types of Ca2+ channels and voltage-dependent K+ channels. Nevertheless, all these channels are conceptually similar."
"They are membrane channels that are normally closed and as a result of changes in potential, the channel  is opened. The amino acid sequence of these channels is known in considerable detail and specific amino acid sequences have been related to specific aspects of channel function . A third major channel class, the transmitter-gated or ligand-gated channels, will be described later."
"Ion channel mutations have been identified as a possible cause of a wide variety of inherited disorders. Several disorders  involving muscle membrane excitability have been  associated with mutations  in calcium, sodium and chloride channels as well as acetylcholine receptors and have been labeled ‘channelopathies’. It is possible that movement disorders, epilepsy and headache, as well as other rare inherited diseases, might be  linked to ion channels."
"The manifestations and mechanisms of channelopathies affecting neurons are reviewed in Kullman, 2002. The existence of channelopathies may provide insights into the variety of cellular mechanisms  associated with the misfunctioning of neuronal circuits. The absolute refractory period is a period of time after the initiation of one action potential when it is impossible to initiate a second action potential no matter how much the cell is depolarized."
"The relative refractory period is a period after one action potential is initiated when it is possible to initiate a second action potential, but only with a greater depolarization than was necessary to initiate the first. The relative refractory period can be understood at least in part by the hyperpolarizing afterpotential. Assume that an initial stimulus depolarized a cell from -60 mV to -45 mV in order to reach threshold and then consider delivering the same 15-mV stimulus sometime during the after-hyperpolarization."
"The stimulus would again depolarize the cell but the depolarization would be below threshold and insufficient to trigger an action potential. If the stimulus was made larger, however, such that it again was capable of depolarizing the cell to threshold , an action potential could be initiated. The absolute refractory period can be explained by the dynamics of the process of Na+-inactivation, the features of which are illustrated in Figure 2."
"10. Here, two voltage clamp pulses are delivered. The first pulse produces a voltage-dependent increase in the Na+ permeability which then undergoes the process of inactivation."
"If the two pulses are separated sufficiently in time, the second pulse produces a change in the Na+ conductance, which is identical to the first pulse. However, if the second pulse comes soon after the first pulse, then the change in Na+ conductance produced by the second pulse is less than that produced by the first. Indeed, if the second pulse occurs immediately after the first pulse, the second pulse produces no change in the Na+ conductance."
"Therefore, when the Na+ channels open and spontaneously inactivate, it takes time  for them to recover from that inactivation. This process of recovery from inactivation underlies the absolute refractory period. During an action potential the Na+ channels open and then they become inactivated."
"Therefore, if a second stimulus is delivered soon after the one that initiated the first spike, there will be few Na+ channels available to be opened by the second stimulus because they have been inactivated by the first action potential. The absolute refractory period seems like a relatively unimportant phenomenon, but actually it is essential to ensure unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons. Once an action potential is initiated at one point in the nerve cell, how does it propagate to the synaptic terminal region in an all-or-nothing fashion Figure 3."
1 shows a schematic diagram of an axon and the charge distributions that would be expected to occur along the membrane of that axon. Positive charges exist on the outside of the axon and negative charges on the inside. Now consider the consequences of delivering some stimulus to a point in the middle of the axon.
"If the depolarization is sufficiently large, voltage-dependent sodium channels will be opened, and an action potential will be initiated. Consider for the moment ""freezing"" the action potential at its peak value. Its peak value now will be about +40 mV inside with respect to the outside."
"Unlike charges attract, so the positive charge will move to the adjacent region of the membrane. As the charge moves to the adjacent region of the membrane, the adjacent region of the membrane will depolarize. If it depolarizes sufficiently, as it will, voltage-dependent sodium channels in the adjacent region of the membrane will be opened and a ""new"" action potential will be initiated."
"This charge distribution will then spread to the next region and initiate other ""new"" action potentials. One way of viewing this process is with a thermal analogue. You can think of an axon as a piece of wire coated with gunpowder ."
"If a sufficient stimulus  is delivered to the wire, the gunpowder will ignite, generate heat, and the heat will spread along the wire to adjacent regions and cause the gunpowder in the adjacent regions to ignite. A great variability is found in the velocity of the propagation of action potentials. In fact, the propagation velocity of the action potentials in nerves can vary from 100 meters per second  to less than a tenth of a meter per second ."
"Why do some axons propagate information very rapidly and others slowly? In order to understand how this process works, it is necessary to consider two so-called passive properties of membranes, the time constant and the space or length constant. Why are these called passive properties?"
They have nothing to do with any of the voltage-dependent conductances discussed earlier. They have nothing to do with any pumps or exchangers. They are intrinsic properties of all biological membranes.
"Time Constant. First, consider a thermal analogue. Place a block of metal at 10oC on a hotplate at 100oC."
How would the temperature change? It will increase from its initial value of 10oC to a final value of 100oC. But the temperature will not change instantly.
"In fact, it would change as an exponential function of time. An analogous situation occurs in nerve cells, when they receive an instantaneous stimulus. The figure at right represents an idealized nerve cell."
"The recording electrode initially measures a potential of -60 mV . At some point in time , the switch is closed. The switch closure occurs instantaneously and as a result of the instantaneous closure, instantaneous current flows through the circuit."
"Note that despite the fact that this stimulus changes instantly, the change in potential does not occur instantaneously. It takes time for the potential to change from its initial value of -60 mV to its final value of -50 mV. There is a total of 10 mV depolarization, but the change occurs as an exponential function of time."
There is a convenient index of how rapidly exponential functions change with time. The index is denoted by the symbol τ and called the time constant. It is defined as the amount of time it takes for the change in potential to reach 63% of its final value.
"In this example, the potential changes from -60 to -50 and the 63% value is -53. 7 mV. Thus, the time constant is 10 msec."
"The smaller the time constant, the more rapid will be the change in response to a stimulus. Therefore, if this neuron had a time constant of 5 msec, then in 5 msec the membrane potential would reach -53. 7 mV."
"The time constant is analogous to the 0 to 60 rating of a high performance car; the lower the 0 to 60 rating, the faster the car. The lower the time constant, the faster or more rapidly a membrane will respond to a stimulus. The effects of the time constant on propagation velocity will become clear below."
"The time constant is a function of two properties of membranes, the membrane resistance  and the membrane capacitance . Rm is the inverse of the permeability; the higher the permeability, the lower the resistance, and vice versa. Membranes, like the physical devices known as capacitors, can store charge."
"When a stimulus is delivered, it takes time to charge up the membrane to its new value. [Please consult a college-level textbook on physics for a review of the basic properties of resistors and capacitors. For an additional review of resistors, capacitors and time constants and the use of hydraulic analogues to understand them see:  Byrne, J."
"H. , Understanding Electricity with Water, epub, Lulu. com, 2011."
"] Space Constant. Consider another thermal analogue. Take a long, metal rod that is again initially at 10oC and consider the consequences of touching one end of the rod to a hotplate which is at 100oC."
How would the temperature be distributed along the length of the rod? There would be a temperature gradient along the rod because of the increasing loss of heat with greater distances from the heat source. The temperature gradient can be described by an exponential function of distance because of the physical processes involved.
"An analogous situation occurs in nerve cells. The figure at left represents an idealized nerve cell in which recordings are made from different regions along the axon at 1 mm increments. The cell body is impaled with a stimulating electrode connected to a battery, the value of which changes the potential of the cell body to -50 mV ."
"This axon, even though it initially had a spatially uniform resting potential of -60 mV, now has a potential of -50 mV in the soma because that is the region in which the stimulus is applied. However, the potential is not -50 mV all along the axon; it varies as a function of distance from the soma. One mm away the potential is -56 mV; at 2 mm away it is even closer to -60 mV; and far enough along the axon, the potential of the axon is -60 mV, the resting potential."
"Just as there is an index for how a change in potential changes with the time , there is also an index denoted by the symbol λ  which is an indication of how far a potential will spread along an axon in response to a subthreshold stimulus at another point. In Figure 3. 3, the space constant or length constant is 1 mm."
"In 1 mm the potential will change by 63% of its final value. If λ was greater than 1 mm, the potential would spread a greater distance. If λ was 1/2 mm, the potential would spread less along the axon."
"Thus, whereas the time constant is an index of how rapidly a membrane would respond to a stimulus in time, the space constant is an index of how well a subthreshold potential will spread along an axon as a function of distance. The space constant is a passive property of membranes. Although it influences the rate of propagation of the action potentials, it is an independent process."
"It is like the surface of a race track and the action potential is like the race car. If the surface is muddy, the car will go slow, if it is firm and paved, the same car will be able to go much faster. The length constant can be described in terms of the physical parameters of the axon, where d is the diameter of the axon, Rm is, as before, the membrane resistance, the inverse of the permeability, and Ri is the internal resistance ."
"Ri is an indicator of the ability of charges to move along the inner surface of the axon. A small subthreshold change in the charge distribution at one point along an axon will spread along the axon, but as it does some will diffuse back out of the membrane and some will continue to move along the axon. If the resistance of the membrane  is high, less will leak out and relatively more will move along the axon."
"Increasing Rm is like putting insulation on a metal rod and heating the rod at one end. With more insulation , more heat will travel along the inside of the rod. Propagation Velocity."
"How are the time constant and the space constant related to propagation velocity of action potentials? The smaller the time constant, the more rapidly a depolarization will affect the adjacent region. If a depolarization more rapidly affects an adjacent region, it will bring the adjacent region to threshold sooner."
"Therefore, the smaller the time constant, the more rapid will be the propagation velocity. If the space constant is large, a potential change at one point would spread a greater distance along the axon and bring distance regions to threshold sooner. Therefore, the greater the space constant, the more rapidly distant regions will be brought to threshold and the more rapid will be the propagation velocity."
"Thus, the propagation velocity is directly proportional to the space constant and inversely proportional to the time constant. There are separate equations that describe both the time constant and the space constant. The insight above allows us to make a new equation that combines the two."
"The equation provides insights into how it is possible for different axons to have different propagation velocities. One way of endowing an axon with a high propagation velocity is to increase the diameter. However, there is one serious problem in changing the propagation velocity by simply changing the diameter."
"To double the velocity, it is necessary to quadruple the diameter. Clearly there must be a better way of increasing propagation velocity than by simply increasing the diameter. Another way to increase the propagation velocity is to decrease the membrane capacitance."
"This can be achieved by coating axons with a thick insulating sheath known as myelin. One potential problem with this approach is that the process of covering the axon would cover voltage-dependent Na+ channels. If Na+ channels are occluded, it would be impossible to generate an action potential."
"Instead of coating the entire axon with the myelin, only sections are coated and some regions called nodes are left bare. Propagation of action potentials in myelinated fibers is illustrated in Figure 3. 4."
"Start with an action potential at a node on the left. In the absence of myelin, the action potential would propagate actively through the simple mechanisms discussed above. However, now the myelin occludes all the voltage-dependent sodium channels so the action potential can not propagate actively."
"Rather, the potential change produced by the action potential at one node spreads in the internodal region along the axon passively just as the temperature would spread along a long metal rod. The potential spreads, but gets smaller , just as a temperature change induced at one end of a rod would get smaller as it spreads along a rod. Now consider the point at which the passively spreading potential reaches the next node."
"A ""new"" action potential will be initiated. The stimulus for this action potential is the depolarization that emerges from the end of the myelin. Each node acts as a ""relay station"" that renews the decremented signal."
"Think of the gunpowder analogue again, but this time coat the rod with some insulation and put gunpowder only at the bare regions. Because of the insulation, a temperature change produced by the ignition of the gunpowder will spread effectively along the metal rod. Some loss of temperature will occur but it will be sufficient to ignite the gunpowder at the next region and the process will repeat itself."
"The synapse is a specialized structure that allows one neuron to communicate with another neuron or a muscle cell. There are billions of nerve cells in the brain and each nerve cell can make and receive up to 10,000 synaptic connections with other nerve cells. Also, the strength of the synapse is modifiable."
"Changes in the strength of synapses endow the nervous system with the ability to store information. The synapse for which most is known is the one formed between a spinal motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell. Historically, it has been studied extensively because it is relatively easy to analyze."
"However, the basic properties of synaptic transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction are very similar to the process of synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Consequently, an understanding of this synapse leads to an understanding of the others. Therefore, we will first discuss the process of synaptic transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction."
The features of the synaptic junction at the neuromuscular junction are shown in the figure at left. Skeletal muscle fibers are innervated by motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The terminal region of the axon gives rise to very fine processes that run along skeletal muscle cells.
Along these processes are specialized structures known as synapses. The particular synapse made between a spinal motor neuron and skeletal muscle cell is called the motor endplate because of its specific structure. The synapse at the neuromuscular junction has three characteristic features of chemical synapses in the nervous system.
"First, there is a distinct separation between the presynaptic and the postsynaptic membrane. The space between the two is known as the synaptic cleft. The space tells us there must be some intermediary signaling mechanism between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron in order to have information flow across the synaptic cleft."
"Second, there is a characteristic high density of small spherical vesicles. These synaptic vesicles contain neurotransmitter substances. Synapses are also associated with a high density of mitochondria."
"Third, in most cases, there is a characteristic thickening of the postsynaptic membrane, which is due at least in part to the fact that the postsynaptic membrane has a high density of specialized receptors that bind the chemical transmitter substances released from the presynaptic neuron. Additional details on the morphological features of synaptic junctions is provided in Chapter 8 and Chapter 10. The figure at the right illustrates in a very schematic way how it is possible to study the physiology of synaptic transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction in great detail."
A piece of muscle and its attached nerve are placed in a small experimental chamber filled with an appropriate Ringer solution. The resting potential of the muscle cell is recorded with a microelectrode. Electrodes are also placed on the surface of the nerve axon.
"Brief electric shocks cause action potentials to be initiated, which propagate to the synaptic terminal. The figure below illustrates two types of potential changes that were recorded in such an isolated nerve-muscle preparation. The experiment also illustrates the properties of a powerful drug, curare, which has proven to be very useful in studying the process of synaptic transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction."
Part A illustrates the sequence of potential changes recorded in the muscle cell as a result of stimulating the motor axon. The arrow indicates the point in time when the shock is delivered to the motor axon. Note that there is a quiescent period of time after the shock.
"The delay is due to the time it takes for the action potential in the motor axon to propagate from its site of initiation. After the delay, there are two types of potentials recorded in the muscle cell. First, there is a relatively slowly changing potential that will be the focus of the following discussion."
"If that slow initial potential is sufficiently large, as it normally is in skeletal muscle cells, a second potential, an action potential, is elicited in the muscle cell. Action potentials in skeletal muscle cells are due to ionic mechanisms similar to those discussed previously. Specifically, there is a voltage-dependent change in Na+ permeability followed by a delayed increase in K+ permeability."
"The underlying event that triggers the action potential can be revealed by taking advantage of curare, an arrow poison used by some South American Indians. A low dose of curare  reduces the underlying event, but it is still not sufficiently reduced to fall below threshold. If a somewhat higher dose of curare is delivered , the slow underlying event becomes subthreshold."
"The underlying signal is known as the endplate potential  because it is a potential change recorded at the motor endplate. Generally, it is known as an excitatory postsynaptic potential . Curare blocks the endplate potential because it is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine , the transmitter released at the presynaptic terminal."
Curare does not block the voltage-dependent Na+ conductance or the voltage-dependent K+ conductance that underlies the muscle action potential. Curare affects the stimulus  which normally leads to the initiation of the muscle action potential. An animal that is poisoned with curare will asphyxiate because the process of neuromuscular transmission at respiratory muscles is blocked.
"Normally, the magnitude of the endplate potential is quite large. Indeed, the amplitude of the endplate potential is about 50 mV, but only about 30 mV is needed to reach threshold. The extra 20 mV is called the safety factor."
"Therefore, even if the endplate potential were to become somewhat smaller  because of fatigue, the EPP would reach threshold and the one-to-one relationship between an action potential in the motor axon and an action potential in the muscle cell would be preserved. The figure on the left illustrates an experiment that examines the propagation of the endplate potential. The muscle fiber is impaled repeatedly with electrodes at 1 mm intervals."
"The endplate potential is not propagated in an all-or-nothing fashion. It does spread along the muscle, but it does so with decrement. Thus, the spread of the endplate potential from its site of initiation to other sites along the muscle cell occurs passively and with decrement, just as a subthreshold potential change in one portion of the axon spreads along the axon, or just as a change in temperature at one point on a metal rod spreads along the rod."
What are the other steps in the process of chemical synaptic transmission? Figure 4. 5 provides an overview.
"A nerve action potential that is initiated in the cell body of a spinal motor neuron propagates out the ventral roots and eventually invades the synaptic terminals of the motor neurons. As a result of the action potential, the chemical transmitter acetylcholine  is released into the synaptic cleft. ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to special receptors on the postsynaptic or the postjunctional membrane."
"The binding of ACh to its receptors produces a conformational change in a membrane channel that is specifically permeable to both Na+ and K+. As a result of an increase in Na+ and K+ permeability, there is a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. That depolarization is called the endplate potential or more generally the EPSP."
"If the EPSP is sufficiently large, as it normally is at the neuromuscular junction, it leads to initiation of an action potential in the muscle cell. The action potential initiates the process of excitation contraction coupling and the development of tension. The duration of the endplate potential is about 10 msec."
"Two factors control the duration of the EPSP at the neuromuscular junction. First, ACh is removed by diffusion. Second, a substance in the synaptic cleft, called acetylcholinesterase , hydrolyzes or breaks down ACh."
"AChE is one of the most efficient enzymes known. A single molecule of AChE can hydrolyze 600,000 molecules of ACh per minute. An important family of substances, one of which is neostigmine, inhibits the action of AChE."
"Neostigmine blocks the action of AChE, and thereby makes the endplate potential larger and longer in duration. This figure illustrates two endplate potentials. One was recorded in saline and curare and a second recorded after neostigmine was added to the solution."
"After applying neostigmine the endplate potential is much larger and longer in duration. Myasthenia gravis is associated with severe muscular weakness because of a decrease in the number of acetylcholine receptors in the muscle cell. If the endplate potential is smaller, the endplate potential will fail to reach threshold."
"If it fails to reach threshold, there will be no action potential in the muscle cell and no contraction of the muscle, which causes muscular weakness. Neostigmine and other inhibitors of AChE are used to treat patients with myasthenia gravis. These agents make the amount of acetylcholine that is released more effectively reach the remaining acetylcholine receptors."
"Although inhibitors of AChE have important therapeutic value, some inhibitors have been, and are still used as poisons. Some AChE inhibitors such as Soman and Sarin form a fairly irreversible block of AChE. This block leads to extreme levels of ACh in the synaptic cleft."
"Individuals so poisoned die from seizures and muscle spasticity including respiratory muscles. Iontophoresis is an interesting technique that can be used to further test the hypothesis that ACh is the neurotransmitter substance at the neuromuscular junction. If ACh is the transmitter that is released by this synapse, one would predict that it should be possible to substitute artificial application of the transmitter for the normal release of the transmitter."
"Since ACh is a positively charged molecule, it can be forced out of a microelectrode to simulate the release of ACh from a presynaptic terminal. Indeed, minute amounts of ACh can be applied to the vicinity of the neuromuscular junction. Figure 4."
8 compares an EPP produced by stimulation of the motor axon and the response to ejections of ACh. The potential change looks nearly identical to the endplate potential produced by the normal release of ACh. This experiment provides experimental support for the concept that ACh is the natural transmitter at this synapse.
The response to the ejection of ACh has some other interesting properties that are all consistent with the cholinergic nature of the synapse at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. Neostigmine makes the response to the iontophoresis of ACh longer and larger. Curare reduces the response because it competes with the normal binding of ACh.
"If ACh is ejected into the muscle cell, nothing happens because the receptors for acetylcholine are not in the inside; they are on the outside of the muscle cell. Application of acetylcholine to regions of the muscle away from the end-plate produces no response because the receptors for the ACh are concentrated at the synaptic region. To test your understanding so far, consider how an agent such as TTX would affect the generation of both an EPP and the response of a muscle fiber to the iontophoretic application of ACh?"
"TTX has no effect on the response to ACh, but it does block the EPP. The reason the response to ACh is unaffected is clear, but many expect that if there is no effect here, there should be no effect on the EPP either. Tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of acetylcholine to the receptors and therefore will not affect the response to direct application of ACh."
"However, tetrodotoxin will affect the ability of an action potential to be elicited in the motor axon. If an action potential cannot be elicited in the motor axon, it cannot cause the release of transmitter. Thus, tetrodotoxin would totally abolish the EPP."
"The block would not be due to a block of ACh receptors, but rather to a block of some step prior to the release of the transmitter. Bernard Katz and his colleagues were pioneers in investigating mechanisms of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. They suggested that the channel opened by ACh was one that had equal permeability to both Na+ and K+."
"Because it was equally permeable to Na+ and K+, Katz suggested that, as a result of the opening of these channels, the membrane potential would move toward 0 mV. The experiment shown in the figure on the left tests that concept. The muscle cell has been penetrated with a recording electrode as well as another electrode that can be connected to a suitable source of potential in order to artificially change the membrane potential."
"Normally, the membrane potential is about -80 mV [Skeletal muscle cells have higher  resting potentials than most nerve cells. ] Again, a small amount of curare is added so that the EPP is small. Katz noticed in these experiments that the size of the EPP changed dramatically depending upon the potential of the muscle cell."
"If the membrane potential is moved to 0 mV, no potential change is recorded whatsoever. If the membrane potential is made +30 mV, the EPP is inverted. So three different stimuli produce endplate potentials that are very different from each other."
"The lack of a response when the potential is at 0 mV is particularly informative. Consider why no potential change is recorded. Presumably, the transmitter is being released and binding to the receptors."
"The simple explanation for a lack of potential change is that the potential at which the opening of ACh channels are trying to reach has already been achieved. If the membrane potential is made more positive than 0 mV, then the EPP is inverted. No matter what the potential, the change in permeability tends to move the membrane potential towards 0 mV! If the resting potential is more negative than 0 mV, there is an upward deflection."
"If it is more positive, there is a downward deflection. If it is already at 0 mV, there is no deflection. This potential is also called the reversal potential, because it is the potential at which the sign of the synaptic potential reverses."
"The experiment indicates that, as a result of ACh binding to receptors, specific channels become equally permeable to Na+ and K+. This permeability change tends to move the membrane potential from wherever it is initially towards a new potential of 0 mV. Why does the normal endplate potential never actually reach 0 mV?"
"One reason is that the sequence of permeability changes that underlie the action potential ""swamp out"" the changes produced by the EPP. But even if an action potential was not triggered, the EPP still would not reach 0 mV. This is because the ACh channels are only a small fraction of the total number of channels in muscle fibers."
The K+ channels that endow a muscle cell with its resting potential are present as well. Their job is to try to maintain the cell at the resting potential. The channel opened by ACh is a member of a general class of channels called ligand-gated channels or ionotropic receptors.
"As illustrated in Figure 4. 10, the transmitter binding site is part of the channel itself. As a result of transmitter binding to the receptor , there is a conformational change in the protein allowing a pore region to open and ions to flow down their electrochemical gradients."
Additional details of the channel are presented in Chapter 11. Calcium is a key ion involved in the release of chemical transmitter substances. Bernard Katz and his colleagues examined its role using the skeletal nerve muscle synapse.
"Electrodes were placed near the presynaptic terminal to initiate an action potential in the terminal . The preparation was perfused with a solution free of calcium. In order to precisely control the delivery of calcium, another microelectrode was filled with calcium."
"Since Ca2+ is positively charged, it can be delivered to the vicinity of the synaptic terminal by briefly closing a switch connected to a battery in such a way that the positive pole forces minute amounts of calcium out of the electrode. In the absence of Ca2+ ejection, stimulation of the motor neuron produced no EPSP. Just before the presynaptic axon was stimulated a second time, the switch was briefly closed to eject a small amount of calcium in the vicinity of the presynaptic terminal."
"A normal EPSP was recorded. The experiment was repeated a third time, but now the calcium ejection occurred after the presynaptic axon was stimulated. There was no EPSP."
"This experiment demonstrates that calcium must be present before or during the action potential in the presynaptic terminal. Based on this experiment and others like it, Katz and colleagues proposed the calcium hypothesis for chemical synaptic transmission. The figure above illustrates some of the key features of the calcium hypothesis for chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, but this hypothesis is generally applicable to all chemical synapses in the nervous system."
"There are two parts to this hypothesis. First, the depolarization of the presynaptic terminal leads to an increase in Ca2+ permeability. Just as there are voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ channels, there are also voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels."
"The structure of the voltage-dependent channels is very similar to the structure of the voltage-dependent sodium channels. Indeed, just a few amino acids can make the difference between a channel being selectively permeable to calcium and one that is selectively permeable to sodium. The Ca2+ channel is normally closed, but if there is a depolarization of the membrane , the channel opens and the opening of the channel allows calcium influx."
"The second part of the calcium hypothesis for chemical synaptic transmission involves the consequences of the Ca2+ influx. The opening of the Ca2+ channel allows for calcium to flow down its concentration gradient from the outside to the inside of the synaptic terminal. This influx leads to an increase in the concentration of the Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal, which by interacting with proteins associated with synaptic vesicles leads to the release of the chemical transmitter substance."
"How does the increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ cause transmitter release? The answer to this question came from an experiment which initially seems unrelated to the issue. Using high amplification of the electrical recording system, Katz noticed small deflections that occurred spontaneously and randomly at a rate of about once every 50 msec ."
"Based on these considerations, Katz called these events miniature endplate potentials or MEPPs. They appeared very similar to endplate potentials, but they were only about 0. 5 mV in amplitude compared to the 50 mV amplitude of the normal EPP."
"Katz suggested that MEPPs were due to the spontaneous and random release of ACh. This idea intuitively makes good sense. If there is an abundance of ACh in the presynaptic terminal, perhaps some will leak out and diffuse across the cleft, bind to ACh receptors, and produce a small potential change."
"ACh is likely to be spontaneously released occasionally because there is a basal level of calcium in the presynaptic terminal. Each vesicle actually contains enough transmitter to open about 1,000 individual ACh-sensitive channels. Therefore, because the MEPP is about 0."
"5 mV in amplitude, the opening of a single channel produces a potential of about 0. 5 μV. Katz suggested, as a result of the experiment illustrated in Figure 5."
"3, that the normal EPP is due to the summation effects of many vesicles being released at the same time. One vesicle produces a potential of about 0. 5 mV."
"The release of 100 of those vesicles at the same time could produce a potential which is 100 times as great . The illustration below  shows one of these vesicles in the process of fusing with the membrane and releasing its contents into the synaptic cleft through a process called exocytosis. For illustrative purposes, each synaptic vesicle is shown to contain three molecules of transmitter."
"In reality, each vesicle contains about 10,000 molecules of transmitter. Vesicles ready to be released are found in a region near the presynaptic terminal membrane called the readily releasable pool. Newly synthesized vesicles are found in the storage or reserve pool."
"The process by which a vesicle migrates from the reserve pool to the readily releasable pool is called mobilization. After fusing with the membrane and releasing its contents, the membrane is recycled to form new synaptic vesicles. This process is called recycling."
Additional details of this process are found in Chapter 10. An experiment by Katz that further supported the quantal hypothesis for chemical synaptic transmission is shown above. The extracellular concentration of calcium was lowered to reduce the size of the evoked endplate potential.
"Because less Ca2+ is in the extracellular medium, less Ca2+ will be available to enter through the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. At the arrow, the electrical shock was delivered to the motor axon. Eight successive stimuli were delivered to the presynaptic terminal."
EPSPs with stars are the miniature endplate potentials . Note that they are uncorrelated with the stimulus. The evoked endplate potentials are small and highly variable.
Sometimes the EPP was 1. 6 mV in amplitude; sometimes there was no EPP at all. Sometimes the EPP was 0.
4 mV. Katz noticed that these amplitudes showed a specific kind of distribution. The smallest evoked responses were 0.
"4 mV. He called these responses ""units"". Other times he recorded EPPs that were about 0."
"8 mV and called such responses ""doubles"" because they were twice the unit, and sometimes responses were 1. 6 mV. Figure 5."
5 is a plot of the number of times an EPP of various amplitudes was observed. Katz noticed that the amplitude of the smallest EPP that could be evoked was the same amplitude  as the amplitude of the MEPP. Based on these results Katz proposed the quantal hypothesis for chemical synaptic transmission.
"An action potential in the presynaptic cell produces an influx of Ca2+which promotes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminal. There is a statistical variability in the amount of vesicles that can be released. When the extracellular calcium concentration is low, sometimes there is not enough calcium to release any vesicles."
"At other times, there is enough calcium to cause the release of one vesicle and other times two vesicles, or three vesicles, and so forth. Each peak is therefore an integral multiple of the next, indicating that these vesicles are released in a quantized fashion. With normal levels of calcium, there is sufficient influx of Ca2+to release about 100 vesicles, which produce an endplate potential  of about 50 mV."
"One of the simplest behaviors mediated by the central nervous system is knee-jerk or stretch reflex. In response to a neurologist's hammer to the patella tendon, there is a reflex extension of the leg. Figure 6."
"1 illustrates the neurocircuitry that controls that reflex response. The stretch to the patella tendon stretches the extensor muscle. More specifically, it stretches a group of specific receptors known as muscle spindle receptors or simply stretch receptors."
"The stretch elicits action potentials in the stretch receptors which then propagate over type 1A afferent fibers, the somata of which are located in the dorsal root ganglion. Processes of these sensory neurons then enter the spinal cord and make synaptic connections with two types of cells. First, a synaptic connection is formed with the extensor motor neuron located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord."
"As the result of synaptic activation of this motor neuron, action potentials are elicited in the motor neuron and propagate out the ventral roots, ultimately invading the terminal regions of the motor axon , causing release of acetylcholine, depolarization of the muscle cell, formation of an action potential in the muscle cell, and a subsequent contraction of the muscle. The sensory neurons also make synaptic connections with another type of neuron in the spinal cord called an interneuron. Interneurons are so named because they are interposed between one type of neuron and another."
"The particular interneuron shown is an inhibitory interneuron. As a result of its activation through the process of synaptic transmission, action potentials are elicited in the interneuron. An action potential in the inhibitory neuron leads to the release of a chemical transmitter substance that inhibits the flexor motor neuron, thereby preventing an improper movement from occurring."
"This particular reflex is known as the monosynaptic stretch reflex because this reflex is mediated by a single excitatory synaptic relay in the central nervous system. The figure at right illustrates how it is possible to experimentally examine some of the components of synaptic transmission in the reflex pathway that mediates the stretch reflex. Normally, the sensory neuron is activated by a stretch to the stretch receptor, but this process can be bypassed by injecting a depolarizing current into the sensory neuron."
"That stimulus initiates an action potential in the sensory neuron which leads to a change in the potential of the motor neuron. This potential is known as an excitatory postsynaptic potential ; excitatory because it tends to depolarize the cell, thereby tending to increase the probability of firing an action potential in the motor neuron and postsynaptic because it is a potential recorded on the postsynaptic side of the synapse. The ionic mechanisms for the EPSP in the spinal motor neuron are essentially identical to the ionic mechanisms for the EPSP at the neuromuscular junction."
"Specifically, the transmitter substance diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific ionotropic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to a simultaneous increase in the sodium and potassium permeability . The mechanisms for release are also identical to those at the neuromuscular junction. An action potential in the presynaptic terminal leads to the opening of voltage dependent Ca2+ channels, and the Ca2+ influx causes transmitter substance to be released."
"There are two fundamental differences between the process of synaptic transmission at the sensorimotor synapse in the spinal cord and the process of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. First, transmitter substance released by the sensory neuron is not ACh but rather the amino acid glutamate. Indeed, there are many different transmitters in the central nervous system - up to 50 or more and the list grows every year."
"Fortunately, these 50 or more transmitter substances can be conveniently grouped into four basic categories: acetylcholine, monoamines, peptides, and the amino acids. Second, in contrast to the 50-mV amplitude of the synaptic potential at the neuromuscular junction, the amplitude of the synaptic potential in a spinal motor neuron, as a result of an action potential in a 1A afferent fiber, is only about 1 mV. If the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential is only 1 mV, how can an action potential in the motor neuron be triggered and the reflex function?"
"Note that a 1-mV EPSP is unlikely to be sufficient to drive the membrane potential of the motor neuron to threshold to fire a spike. If there is no spike, there will be no contraction of the muscle. The answer is that the stretch of the muscle fires multiple action potentials in many different stretch receptors."
"In fact, the greater the stretch, the greater is the probability of activating more stretch receptors. This process is referred to as recruitment. Therefore, multiple 1A afferents will converge onto the spinal motor neuron and participate in its activation."
"This is not the whole answer, however. Recall that the greater the intensity of the stimulus, the greater is the number of action potentials elicited in a sensory receptor. The greater the stretch, the greater the number of action potentials elicited in a single sensory neuron and the greater number of EPSPs produced in the motor neuron from that train of action potentials in the sensory cell."
The processes by which the multiple EPSPs from presynaptic neurons summate over space and time are called temporal and spatial summation. Temporal summation. A single action potential in sensory neuron 1 produces a 1-mV EPSP in the motor neuron.
"Now consider the consequences of firing two action potentials in quick succession . Two EPPs are elicited, the second of which summates on the falling edge of the first. As a result of two action potentials, a summated potential about 2 mV in amplitude occurs."
"If there were three presynaptic action potentials, and they occurred rapidly enough, the total potential would be about 3 mV, and so forth. Temporal summation is strictly a passive property of nerve cells. Special ionic conductive mechanisms are not needed to explain it."
"The potentials summate because of the passive properties of the nerve cell membrane, specifically the ability of membranes to store charge. The membrane temporarily stores the charge of the first PSP and then the charge from the second PSP is added to it to produce a potential twice as large at first. This process of temporal summation is very much dependent upon the duration of the synaptic potential."
"The temporal summation occurs when the presynaptic action potentials occur in quick succession. The time frame is dependent upon the passive properties of the membrane, specifically the time constant. Spatial summation."
"Now consider a motor neuron that receives two inputs. An action potential produced in sensory neuron 1 produces a 1-mV EPSP and a single action potential in sensory neuron 2 also produces a 1-mV EPSP. If action potentials are produced simultaneously in sensory neuron 1 and in sensory neuron 2, the EPSPs summate to produce a summated EPSP which is twice that of the individual EPSPs."
"Spatial summation in nerve cells occurs because of the space constant, the ability of a charge produced in one region of the cell to spread to other regions of the cell. Whether a neuron fires in response to a synaptic input is dependent upon how many action potentials are being fired in any one afferent input, as well as how many individual afferent pathways are activated. The decision to fire also depends on the presence of inhibitory synaptic inputs."
"Artificially depolarizing the interneuron to initiate an action potential produces a transient hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of the motor neuron . The time course of this hyperpolarization looks very similar to that of an EPSP, but it is reversed in sign. The synaptic potential in the motor neuron is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential  because it tends to move the membrane potential away from the threshold, thereby decreasing the probability of this neuron initiating an action potential."
"The membrane potential of the flexor motor neuron is about -65 mV, so one might predict that the IPSP would be due to an increase in the permeability or the conductance of an ion whose equilibrium potential is more negative than -65 mV. One possibility is potassium. Potassium does mediate some inhibitory synaptic potentials in the central nervous system, but not at the particular synapse between a spinal interneuron and spinal motor neuron."
"At this particular synapse, the IPSP is due to a selective increase in chloride permeability. Note that the equilibrium potential for chloride is about -70 mV. The transmitter released by the spinal interneuron binds to a special class of ionotropic receptors which are normally closed, but open and become selectively permeable to chloride ions as a result of the binding of the transmitter."
"As a result of the increase in Cl- permeability, the membrane potential moves from its resting value of -65 mV towards the Cl- equilibrium potential. What about the transmitter substance that is released by the inhibitory interneuron in the spinal cord? The transmitter substance is glycine, an amino acid which is used frequently in the central nervous system as a transmitter that produces inhibitory actions."
"It is not the most common, however. The most common transmitter with inhibitory actions is gamma amino butyric acid . In addition to the responses mediated by ionotropic receptors, there is an entirely separate class of synaptic potentials that have durations with orders of magnitude greater than the durations of the classical EPSPs."
These are so-called slow synaptic potentials and they are mediated by metabotropic receptors. Slow synaptic potentials are not observed at every postsynaptic neuron but they are certainly observed at many. The figure below illustrates a postsynaptic neuron which receives two inputs.
An action potential in neuron 1 produces an excitatory postsynaptic potential or EPSP in the postsynaptic cell whose duration is about 20 msec. Neuron 2 can also produce a postsynaptic potential but its duration is more than three orders of magnitude longer than that of the conventional type of synaptic potential. The mechanism of these slow synaptic responses involves changes in metabolism of the cell.
"One mechanism for a slow synaptic potential is shown in the illustration at left  and in Figure 11. 11. In contrast to the ionotropic receptor for which the receptors are actually part of the channel complex, the channels that produce the slow synaptic potentials are not directly coupled to the transmitter receptors."
"Rather, the receptors are separate from the channel. These receptors are known as metabotropic because they involve changes in the metabolism of the cell and, in general, changes in activation of specific second messenger systems. The figure at left illustrates an example of one type of response that involves the cyclic AMP cascade."
"Slow PSPs are in some cases mediated by cyclic AMP but they are also mediated by other protein kinases. For the response in Figure 6. 5, the transmitter activates G proteins that lead to the increased synthesis of cyclic AMP."
"Cyclic AMP then leads to the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase , which phosphorylates a channel protein or a component of the channel and then produces a conformational change in the channel and a change in its ionic permeability. In contrast to a direct conformational change produced by the binding of a transmitter to the receptor channel complex , the conformational change is produced by phosphorylation. The particular channel is one that is selectively permeable to K+ and is normally open."
"As a result of the channel phosphorylation by PKA, the channel closes and becomes less permeable to K+. Since the normal resting potential is due to a balance of Na+ and K+, decreasing the K+ conductance favors the effects of the Na+ conductance and a depolarization is produced. It is interesting to point out that the activation of metabotropic receptors can produce effects which are much longer than several hundred seconds."
"For example, protein kinase A can diffuse in the nucleus where it can phosphorylate proteins  that regulate gene expression. This chapter and the two previous ones have focused on chemical synaptic transmission. As you have seen for chemical synapses, there is a distinct cytoplasmic discontinuity that separates the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes ."
"This discontinuity is known as the synaptic cleft. The presynaptic terminal of chemical synapses contains a high concentration of mitochondria and synaptic vesicles, and there is a characteristic thickening of the postsynaptic membrane. As a result of a depolarization or an action potential in the presynaptic terminal, chemical transmitters are released from the presynaptic terminal, which diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptor sites on the postsynaptic membrane."
"This leads to a permeability change that produces the postsynaptic potential. For chemical synapses, there is a delay  between the initiation of an action potential in the presynaptic terminal and a potential change in the postsynaptic cell. The synaptic delay is due to the time necessary for transmitter to be released, diffuse across the cleft, and bind with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane."
"Chemical synaptic transmission is generally unidirectional. A potential change in the presynaptic cell releases transmitter that produces a postsynaptic potential, but a depolarization in the postsynaptic cell does not produce any effects in the presynaptic cell because no transmitter is released from the postsynaptic cell at the synaptic region. The most predominant type of synapse is the chemical synapse, and for that reason they have been the focus of this and the previous chapters."
"However, another category of synapses are those associated with electrical synaptic transmission. Electrical synaptic transmission is mediated by specialized structures known as gap junctions , which provide a pathway for cytoplasmic continuity between the presynaptic and the postsynaptic cells. Consequently, a depolarization  produced in the presynaptic terminal produces a change in potential of the postsynaptic terminal, which is due to the direct ionic pathway between the cells."
"For electrical synapses, a minimal synaptic delay is present; as soon as a potential change is produced in the presynaptic terminal, a reflection of that potential change is produced in the postsynaptic cell. Electrical junctions are found in both the nervous system and between other excitable membranes, such as smooth muscle and cardiac muscle cells. In these muscle cells, they provide an important pathway for the propagation of action potentials from one muscle cell to another."
"The discovery of certain toxins has greatly facilitated the analysis of voltage and chemically gated channels as well as the process of synaptic transmission. The following table illustrates some that have been particularly useful. Historically, it was generally thought that the role of the synapse was to simply transfer information between one neuron and another neuron or between a neuron and a muscle cell."
"In addition, it was thought that these connections, once established during development, were relatively fixed in their strength, much like a solder joint between two electronic components. One exciting development in neurobiology over the past forty years is the realization that most synapses are extremely plastic; they are able to change their strength as a result of either their own activity or through activity in another pathway. Many think that this synaptic plasticity is central to understanding the mechanisms of learning and memory."
"There are two general forms of synaptic plasticity, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic mechanisms, also known as homosynaptic mechanisms, refer to changes in the strength of a synapse that are brought about by its own activity. Extrinsic plasticity, or heterosynaptic plasticity, is a change in the strength of a synapse brought about by activity in another pathway."
"Homosynaptic Plasticity. There are two types of intrinsic or homosynaptic plasticity, synaptic depression and synaptic facilitation. Synaptic depression and facilitation are not always found at the same synapse."
"Some synapses exhibit one but not the other, whereas some synapses exhibit both. Figure 7. 1B illustrates homosynaptic plasticity at the synapse between a 1A afferent fiber and a spinal motor neuron."
"An action potential in the sensory neuron produces an EPSP in the motor neuron. A second action potential in the sensory neuron, 200 msec after the first, produces an EPSP that is smaller than that produced by the first action potential. This phenomenon is called synaptic depression."
The efficacy of synaptic transmission is not constant; it varies depending upon the frequency of stimulation. The mechanisms of synaptic depression vary but one common mechanism is depletion of the available transmitter. The second of two action potentials will release less transmitter because less transmitter is available to be released.
"Figure 7. 1C illustrates the second form of homosynaptic plasticity, synaptic facilitation. This particular example is known as paired-pulse or twin-pulse facilitation."
"Two action potentials in the presynaptic cell produce two EPSPs in the postsynaptic cell. The first action potential produces a 1 mV EPSP, but the second action potential, which occurs about 20 msec after the first, produces an EPSP that is larger than the EPSP produced by the first. In this example, it is twice as large as the first one."
This doubling of the EPSP represents the synaptic facilitation. The net EPSP is 3 mV. Through the process of temporal summation the second EPSP  adds to the amplitude of the first EPSP .
"One mechanism contributing to twin pulse facilitation is residual calcium. An action potential leads to the opening of Ca2+ channels and the influx of Ca2+, which leads to the release of transmitter. Now consider the fate of the calcium after the first action potential ."
"Ca2+ levels will decline back to their initial level, but this recovery will not occur instantaneously. Thus, if a second action potential is initiated at a time during which the calcium has not yet recovered to its basal level, the calcium influx associated with the second spike will add to the ""residual calcium"" that is left over from the first. The net effect is that the total concentration of calcium will be greater after the second spike than it was after the first, and more transmitter will be released."
"Another intrinsic type of synaptic plasticity is called post-tetanic potentiation . It is an extreme example of facilitation defined as a relatively persistent  enhancement of synaptic strength following a brief train of spikes . Just as there are two types of homosynaptic plasticity, there are two types of heterosynaptic plasticity."
"Before discussing heterosynaptic plasticity, it is useful to review the types of synapses that are present in the central nervous system. Three broad categories of synapses are found in the central nervous system. Axosomatic synapses are synapses that are made onto the soma or cell body of a neuron."
"Axodendritic synapses, probably the most prominent kind of synapses, are synapses that one neuron makes onto the dendrite of another neuron. Axoaxonic synapses are synapses made by one neuron onto the synapse of another neuron. Axoaxonic synapses mediate presynaptic inhibition and presynaptic facilitation."
"The phenomenon complementary to presynaptic inhibition is presynaptic facilitation. M1 is capable of increasing the strength of the synaptic pathway. As a result of the activation of a second messenger cascade by M1, an action potential in the presynaptic terminal leads to a greater amount of Ca2+ influx, and therefore more transmitter is released."
A very enduring form of synaptic plasticity is called long-term potentiation . It can have both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic components. An electric shock  to afferent fibers produces an EPSP .
"If the pathway is repeatedly stimulated , the amplitude of EPSP is constant. A tetanus produces post-tetanic potentiation  that dies away after several minutes. What is left is a very enduring enhancement of the EPSP."
"There is excitement about LTP because it is the kind of mechanism necessary to store memory . The NMDA-type receptor is critical for some forms of LTP, in particular LTP at the CA3-CA1 synapse in the hippocampus. The postsynaptic spines of CA1 neurons have two types of glutamate receptors; NMDA-type glutamate receptors and the AMPA-type glutamate receptors ."
"Both receptors are permeable to Na+ and K+, but the NMDA-type has two additional features. First, in addition to being permeable to Na+, it also has a significant permeability to Ca2+. Second, this channel is normally blocked by Mg2+ Even if glutamate binds to the channel and produces a conformational change, there is no efflux of K+ or influx of Na+ or Ca2+ because it is ""plugged up"" by the Mg2+ ."
"Thus, a weak test stimulus will not open this channel because it is blocked by Mg2. A weak test stimulus will produce an EPSP, but that EPSP will be mediated by the AMPA receptor. Now consider the consequences of a tetanus ."
"Because of the tetanus, there will be spatial and temporal summation of the EPSPs produced by the multiple afferent synapses on the common postsynaptic cell . Consequently, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron will become very depolarized. Because the inside of the cell becomes positive, the positively charged Mg2+ is ""thrust"" out of the channel ."
"Ca2+ then enters the spine through the NMDA receptor. That Ca2+ activates various protein kinases, which then trigger long-term changes in synaptic strength. One of the long-term changes involves the insertion of additional AMPA receptors ."
"Consequently, the glutamate released by a test stimulus after a LTP-inducing tetanus will open a greater number of channels and thereby produce a larger  EPSP . In addition to an increase in the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, there is evidence that a greater amount of transmitter is released from the presynaptic neurons. The combination of the presynaptic and postsynaptic effects would act synergistically to increase the size of the synaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron."
A given postsynaptic neuron receives synaptic input from a number of different sources. There are the traditional type of axosomatic and axodendritic synapses. These can be either excitatory or inhibitory.
"In addition, the synaptic responses can be mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. The presynaptic cells can be modulated through presynaptic inhibition and presynaptic facilitation. Consider that any one postsynaptic cell makes and receives 10,000 connections with other cells and that this module can be recapitulated in each of the billions of cells in the nervous system."
It is this enormous pattern of synaptic connections and the plasticity that occurs at each one of these synapses which makes the nervous system so extraordinary. It is very difficult to overestimate the importance of synaptic transmission. It is critical to the basic functioning of the nervous system and appears to be critical in learning and memory.
"Also, changes in synaptic transmission seem to be central to understanding a number of neurological disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Parkinson's disease. Synaptic transmission is central to understanding mental diseases such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. A major theme of neuroscience is to identify the specific transmitter systems involved in these brain diseases and design appropriate interventions."
"Finally, most of the psychoactive drugs function by affecting some aspects of synaptic transmission. The human nervous system is estimated to consist of roughly 360 billion non-neural glial cells and 90 billion nerve cells. Furthermore, there are hundreds of different types of neurons based on morphology alone."
"Often, neurons that look similar have strikingly different properties. For example, they utilize and respond to different neurotransmitter. This section reviews the cellular components of nervous tissue."
"Students should be able to describe neurons and glia, their morphological components as seen with the light and electron microscope, and some of the fundamental functional roles these cell types play in the nervous system. The region of the neuron containing the nucleus is known as the cell body, soma, or perikaryon . The cell body is the metabolic center of the neuron."
"The interior of the soma consists of cytoplasm, a gel within a microtrabecular lattice formed by the microtubules and associated proteins that make up the cytoskeleton. Energy producing metabolism and the synthesis of the macromolecules used by the cell to maintain its structure and execute its function are the principal activities of the neuronal soma. As described in Chapter 6, it also acts as a receptive area for synaptic inputs from other cells."
"Embedded within the neuronal cytoplasm are the organelles common to other cells, the nucleus, nucleolus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosomes, lysosomes, endosomes, and peroxisomes. Many of these cell inclusions are responsible for the expression of genetic information controlling the synthesis of cellular proteins involved in energy production, growth, and replacement of materials lost by attrition. The membrane of the neuron functions as a receptive surface over its entire extent; however, specific inputs  from other cells are received primarily on the surface of the cell body and on the surface of the specialized processes known as dendrites."
The dendritic processes may branch extensively and are often covered with projections known as dendritic spines. Spines provide a tremendous increase in the surface area available for synaptic contacts. The dendritic processes and spines of neurons are essentially expansions of cytoplasm containing most of the organelles found in the cell body.
Dendrites contain numerous orderly arrays of microtubules and fewer neurofilaments . The microtubule associated proteins  in the dendrite have a higher molecular weight than those found in the axon. An example is MAP2.
"In addition, microtubules in dendrites have their positive ends toward the cell soma. Mitochondria are often arranged longitudinally. Rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes are present in large but not small dendrites."
"The shape and extent of the ""dendritic tree"" of an individual neuron is indicative of the quantity and variety of information received and processed by that neuron. The dendritic spines often contain microfilaments which is the cytoskeletal element responsible for changes in spine shape observed in some examples of synaptic plasticity. Information is received by the dendrite through an array of receptors on dendrite surface that react to transmitters released from the axon terminals of other neurons."
"Dendrites may consist of a single twig-like extension from the soma or a multi-branched network capable of receiving inputs from thousands of other cells. For instance, an average spinal motor neuron with a moderate-sized dendritic tree, receives 10,000 contacts, with 2,000 of these on the soma and 8,000 on the dendrites. The cone-shaped region of the cell body where the axon originates is termed the axon hillock."
"This area is free of ribosomes and most other cell organelles, with the exception of cytoskeletal elements and organelles that are being transported down the axon. The neurofilaments in the axon hillock become clustered together as fascicles. The region between the axon hillock and the beginning of the myelin sheath is known as the initial segment."
"In many cases, this region is the anatomical location for the initiation of the action potential. The area under the axolemma in this region has material that stains darkly when viewed by EM. This region is shown in Figure 8."
4. At the distal-most end of the axon and its collaterales are small branches whose tips are button-shaped cytoplasmic enlargements called terminal boutons or nerve endings. The cone-shaped region of the cell body where the axon originates is termed the axon hillock.
"This area is free of ribosomes and most other cell organelles, with the exception of cytoskeletal elements and organelles that are being transported down the axon. The neurofilaments in the axon hillock become clustered together as fascicles. The region between the axon hillock and the beginning of the myelin sheath is known as the initial segment."
"In many cases, this region is the anatomical location for the initiation of the action potential. The area under the axolemma in this region has material that stains darkly when viewed by EM. This region is shown in Figure 8."
4. At the distal-most end of the axon and its collaterales are small branches whose tips are button-shaped cytoplasmic enlargements called terminal boutons or nerve endings. The part of the plasma membrane of the nerve ending that is specialized to form functional contacts with other cells is the synapse.
"When neurons interact with muscle fibers, the region of functional contact is called the neuromuscular junction or motor endplate . According to the classical definition of synapse, when a nerve ending synapses on a dendrite or soma of a second neuron it is termed either an axodendritic or an axosomatic synapse, respectively . However, almost all possible combinations of pre- and postsynaptic elements have been found in the central nervous system."
"These different types of synapse are designated by combining the name of the structure of the presynaptic element with that of the postsynaptic structure. For example, when the transfer of information occurs from an axon to axon or from one terminal to another, the synapse involved is called an axoaxonic synapse. Regions of functional contacts between neurons  have distinct morphological characteristics."
"Although a great deal of variation exists in the size and shape of boutons of individual neurons, synapses can be identified by the presence of the following: A presynaptic complement of membrane-bound synaptic vesicles exists. These are spherical vesicles in excitatory nerve endings, shown in Figure 8. 6."
In inhibitory neurons the synaptic vesicle are often flattened as shown in Figure 8. 7. The nerve ending often has aggregations of dense material in the cytoplasm immediately adjacent to the membrane on the pre- and postsynaptic side of the junction  This dense material on the presynaptic side is thought to be the site of vesicle attachment.
"The dense material on the postsynaptic side is a site where receptor proteins and channels are prevalent. Many mitochondria are present, especially in the nerve terminal; and There is a distinct synaptic cleft or intercellular space of approximately 20-40 nm. An endoplasmic reticulum is present that regulates Ca2+ level."
"Endosomal membrane that functions in the recycling of synaptic vesicles. Numerous variations of the ""model"" neuron described above exist. An important modification, which occurs especially in receptor neurons, involves the designation of a neuronal process as a dendrite or as an axon."
"Classically, the axon has been identified as the myelinated or unmyelinated process that transmits signals away from the cell body. The classical view of the dendrite is that of an unmyelinated tube of cytoplasm which carries information toward the cell body. However, this distinction does not hold for ALL neurons."
"Some cells have a myelinated process that transmits signals toward the cell body. Morphologically the ""dendrite"" and the ""axon"" may, therefore, be indistinguishable. Neither the position of the cell body nor the presence or absence of myelin is always a useful criterion for understanding the orientation of the neuron."
"The region of impulse initiation is more reliable guide to understanding the functional focal point of the cell. This region is analogous to the initial segment of the model neuron, discussed above. Routinely the fiber or process, which contains the initial segment or trigger zone, is referred to as an axon."
"Note, as shown in Figure 8. 8, the trigger zone does not have to be immediately adjacent to the cell body. A number of conventions have evolved to classify and name neurons."
"One of the oldest, devised by Golgi in the late 1800’s, is based on the complexity of the dendritic tree of the neuron. Through this approach cells are classified as unipolar, bipolar and multipolar neurons as shown in Figure 8. 8."
"Unipolar cells have only one cell process, and are primarily found in invertebrates. However, vertebrate sensory neurons are another form of this type of cell. Because these cells start out developmentally as bipolar neurons and then become unipolar as they mature, they are called pseudo-unipolar cells."
"Bipolar cells are present in the retina and the olfactory bulb. Multipolar cells make up the remainder of neuronal types and are, consequently, the most numerous type. These have been further sub-categorized into Golgi type II cells that are small neurons, usually interneurons, and Golgi type I cells that are large multipolar neurons."
"Cells are also named for their shape  or for the person who first described them . More recently, cells have been named for their function or the neurotransmitter they contain . This description is possible because of the development of histochemical and immunocytochemical methods to specifically identify the neurotransmitter type used by neurons."
"Many of the terms used in this section are defined below. Axolemma is the plasmalemma of the axon. Endoplasmic reticulum is a labyrinthine, membrane bounded compartment in the cytoplasm where lipids are synthesized and membrane bound proteins are made."
In some regions of the neuron ER is devoid of ribosomes and is termed smooth ER. The smooth ER is involved in Ca2+ buffering and in the biosynthesis and recycling of synaptic vesicles as will be discussed in Chapter 10. Endosome is a membrane-bounded organelle that carries materials ingested by endocytosis and passes them to lysosomes and peroxisomes for degradation.
"It also functions in the nerve ending to recycle synaptic vesicles. Golgi apparatus is a collection of stacked, smooth-surfaced membrane bound organelles where proteins and lipids made in the endoplasmic reticulum are modified and sorted. Lysosomes contain enzymes that digest compounds that originate inside or outside the cells."
"They are involved in converting proteins to amino acids and glycogen to glucose, the basic nutrient of neurons. Their enzymes act at an acidic pH. As will be described later, they also serve as vesicles for reverse transport from axon terminals to the soma."
"Many lysosomes become degraded to lipofuscin granules, which accumulate as the organism ages and are regarded as neuronal refuse. Lysosomes form from the budding off the Golgi apparatus. They have a variety of membrane-bound shapes and sizes, ranging in size between 250 and 700 nm in diameter."
"Microfilaments are 7 nm in diameter filaments arranged as a paired helix of two strands of globular actin. Microfilaments are especially prominent in synaptic terminals, in dendritic spines, and in association with the axolemma. Microtubules are 20 to 25 nm diameter tubular structures that run in loose bundles around the nucleus and funnel into the base of the axonal and dendritic processes where they form parallel arrays distributed longitudinally."
They are made up of dimers of α and β tubulin subunits and contain associated proteins known as microtubule associated proteins . The MAPS regulate the polymerization of tubulin subunits to form the microtubules. The dimers of α and β tubulin subunits polymerize to form proto-filaments arranged in an a helix such that 13 dimer subunits make up each full turn of the a helix.
"In addition, microtubules are not continuous, and each microtubule is composed of numerous 100 nm units. Microtubules are involved in axoplasmic transport . Mitochondria are distributed ubiquitously throughout the cytoplasm of the entire nerve cell and are especially plentiful at presynaptic specializations."
"Neurofilaments are a type of intermediate filament found in nerve cells. Neurofilaments are involved in the maintenance of the neuron's shape and mechanical strength. Although neuronal neurofilaments are classified as intermediate filaments, their composition in neurons is different than that found in other cells."
They are composed of three subunits that are arranged to form a 10-nm diameter tubule. It is the neurofilament that stains with heavy metal to permit the visualization of neuronal shape. Neurofilaments run in loose bundles around the cell nucleus and other organelles and funnel into the base of the axonal and dendritic processes where they form parallel arrays distributed longitudinally.
"Neurofilaments are more abundant than microtubules in axons, whereas microtubules are more abundant than neurofilaments in dendrites. It is the neurofilaments that undergo modification in the Alzheimer's disease to form neurofibrillary tangles. Nucleolus is in the center of the nuclei of all neurons."
"It is a prominent, deeply stained spherical inclusion about one-third the size of the nucleus. The nucleolus synthesizes ribosomal RNA, which has a major role in protein synthesis. Nucleus of the neuron is large and round and is usually centrally located."
"In some cells, masses of deeply staining chromatin are visible in the nucleus. The nuclear membrane of neurons is like that of other cells - a double membrane punctuated by pores  which are involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. The nucleus in neurons is spherical and ranges in diameter from 3 to 18 micrometers depending on the size of the neuron."
"Neurons with long axons have a larger cell body and nucleus. As in other cells, the principal component of the nucleus is deoxyribonucleic acid , the substance of the chromosomes and genes. Peroxisomes are small membrane bounded organelles that use molecular oxygen to oxidize organic molecules."
"They contain some enzymes that either produce or degrade hydrogen peroxide. Plasmalemma of the neuron appears in the electron microscope as a typical bi-layered cellular membrane, approximately 10 nm thick. Postsynaptic density is darkly staining material of postsynaptic cell adjacent to the synapse."
"Receptors, ion channels, and other signaling molecules are likely bound to this material. Presynaptic density is the region of darkly staining material of the presynaptic membrane where synaptic vesicles are hypothesized to dock prior to fusion with the presynaptic membrane. Ribosomes are particles composed of ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein which associate with mRNA and catalyze the synthesis of proteins."
"When ribosomes are attached to the outer membranes of the ER, the organelle is termed rough ER. The rough ER, in laminae with interspersed ribosomes, is visible with the light microscope as Nissl substance. In light microscopic preparations, the appearance of Nissl substance varies in different types of neurons."
It may appear as densely stained ovoids or as finely dispersed particles or aggregations of granules. Synapse is the junction that allows signals to pass from a nerve cell to another cell or from one nerve cell to a muscle cell. The synaptic cleft is the gap between the membrane of the pre- and postsynaptic cell.
"In a chemical synapse the signal is carried by a diffusable neurotransmitter. The cleft between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cells is 20 to 40 nm wide and may appear clear or striated. Recent studies have indicated that the cleft is not an empty space per se, but is filled with carbohydrate-containing material."
"Synaptic vesicles are small spherical organelles in the cytoplasm of neurons that contain neurotransmitter and various proteins necessary for neurotransmitter secretion. Vesicles containing inhibitory neurotransmitter are often flat or elliptical whereas vesicles that contain excitatory neurotransmitter are usually more spherical. The most numerous cellular constituents of the central nervous system are the non-neuronal, neuroglial  cells that occupy the space between neurons."
"It has been estimated that there are roughly 360 billion glial cells, which comprise 80-90% of the cells in the CNS. This section will cover the general classifications of the neuroglial cells and describe some of the general properties that distinguish neuroglia from neurons. Neuroglia differ from neurons in several general ways in that they do not form synapses, have essentially only one type of process, retain the ability to divide, and are less electrically excitable than neurons."
"Neuroglia are classified based on size and shape fo their nucleus and distinguished from neurons, at the light microscopic level. Alkaline  dyes are used to show nuclear morphology. In addition, several metal stains are used show the shape of the cell and cytoplasmic architecture."
"Characteristics of nuclei, including size, shape, staining intensity, and distribution of chromatin, are used to distinguish cell types in pathological material. Cell body characteristics, including size, shape, location, branching pattern, and density of processes, are also used. Neuroglia are divided into two major categories based on size, the macroglia and the microglia."
"The macroglia are of ectodermal origin and consist of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. Microglia cells are probably of mesodermal origin. A comparison of the various neuroglial types is shown in Figure."
"There are three types of macroglia: Oligodendroglia, Ependyma, and Astrocytes. This section discusses the two types of astrocytes: Protoplasmic and Fibrous. Protoplasmic astrocytes are found primarily in gray matter."
"With silver or glial specific stains, their cell bodies and processes are very irregular. The processes may be large or very fine, sometimes forming sheets that run between axons and dendrites, and may even surround synapses. These fine sheet-like processes give the protoplasmic astrocyte cell body a ""fuzzy"" or murky appearance under the light microscope."
Bundles of fine fibrils may be seen within the cytoplasm. The nucleus of a protoplasmic astrocyte is ellipsoid or bean-shaped with characteristic flecks of chromatin. Specific types of intercellular junctions have been noted between the processes of protoplasmic astrocytes.
"These probably mediate ion exchange between cells. Fibrous astrocytes are found primarily in white matter, have a smoother cell body contour than do protoplasmic astrocytes as seen with glial-specific stains, and have processes that tend to emerge from the cell body radially. These processes are narrower and branch to form end feet on blood vessels, ependyma, and pia."
"Consequently, the processes of fibrous astrocytes do not form sheets and do not tend to conform to the shape of the surrounding neurons or vascular elements. The major distinguishing feature of fibrous astrocytes, as the name suggests, is an abundance of glial fibrils arranged in parallel arrays in the cytoplasm and extending into the processes. In Nissl stains, the fibrous astrocytes have a nucleus essentially the same as that of the protoplasmic type with a flecked appearance."
"Intercellular adherences have also been observed between fibrous astrocytes. Both types of astrocytes function to support the neurons in their immediate vicinity. They provide a physical barrier between cells, maintain the ionic and pH equilibrium of the extracellular space around neurons, and continually modify the chemical environment of the neighboring cells."
"As shown in Figure 8. 14, astrocytes form a complete lining around the external surface of the CNS  and around blood vessels . During development, they form scaffolding along which nerve cells migrate to achieve their mature structure."
"During injury, the astrocytes proliferate and phagocytize dead cells. This often leads to the formation of glial scar. In addition to these general functions, astrocytes also act in more specialized ways to facilitate neuron function."
"They metabolize neurotransmitters by removing them from the synaptic cleft. For example, the amino acid glutamate is taken up by astrocytes and inactivated by conversion to glutamine. Glutamine is then transported to the neuron to be re-synthesized into glutamate ."
More recent evidence indicates that the astrocytes can dramatically change size as part of their physiological regulation of the neuronal environment. These functions will be discussed in later sections. Oligodendrocytes are also located in both gray and white matter.
"They are the predominant cell type in white matter where they are often located as rows of cells between groups of neuronal processes. These are termed interfascicular oligodendroglia and are involved in the formation and maintenance of the myelin surrounding the neuronal processes nearby. In gray matter, oligodendroglia are usually located near neurons and, therefore, are known as perineuronal satellite cells."
"Cell bodies of oligodendroglia are often located near capillaries, but they lack the definite perivascular end feet characteristic of astrocytes. The processes of oligodendrocytes are fewer and more delicate than astrocytes, and the cell body shape is polygonal to spherical. The oligodendrocyte nucleus is smaller than that of the astrocyte, is eccentrically located in the cell body, contains clumps of chromatin and can be stained by alkaline dyes."
"The cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes tends to be darker than that of astrocytes with silver stains, and does not contain glial fibrils . Oligodendrocytes are also located in both gray and white matter. They are the predominant cell type in white matter where they are often located as rows of cells between groups of neuronal processes."
"These are termed interfascicular oligodendroglia and are involved in the formation and maintenance of the myelin surrounding the neuronal processes nearby.

The cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes tends to be darker than that of astrocytes with silver stains, and does not contain glial fibrils ."
"In the Peripheral Nervous System , Schwann cells are responsible for the myelin formation. These cells myelinate axons differently than the interfascicular oligodendroglia. As shown in Figure 8."
"16, they migrate around the axon, laying a membrane covering around the axon by squeezing out the cytoplasm of the Schwann cell. Also, every internode of a PNS axon represents a single Schwann cell. In addition unmyelinated axons in the PNS are also enclosed by membranes formed by Schwann cells."
"Ependymal cells are derived from the early germinal epithelium lining the lumen of the neural tube and thus are also ectodermal derivatives . Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are arranged in a single-layered columnar epithelium, and have many of the histological characteristics of simple epithelium, which vary from squamous to cuboidal depending upon their location."
"The ependyma forming the ventricular lining do not connect to a basal lamina, but rest directly upon underlying nervous tissue. As shown in Figure 8. 17, the surface facing the ventricle contains many microvilli and cilia."
"These cilia move cerebrospinal fluid  in the ventricles. The lateral borders of the ependymal cells are relatively straight and form junctions with adjacent cells. Ependymal cells are modified in various regions of the ventricles into layers of cuboidal epithelium, which do lie on a basement membrane  over a rich bed of vasculature and connective tissue."
"This is the choroid plexus studied in the Laboratory that is responsible for the secretion, uptake and transport of substances to and from the CSF. Microglia, in contrast to the other types of glial cells, originate from embryonic mesoderm. They are present throughout the central nervous system, but tend to be inconspicuous in mature normal tissue and are difficult to identify with the light or electron microscope."
"They are more abundant in gray matter, and may compromise up to 5-10% of the neuroglia in the cerebral cortex. The general appearance of microglia is similar to oligodendrocytes, although they are smaller and have undulating processes with spine-like projections. Microglial nuclei are elongated or triangular and stain deeply with alkaline dyes."
"Following damage to nervous tissue, microglia proliferate and migrate to the site of injury where they clear cellular debris by phagocytosis. The reacting microglia have a swollen form with shortened processes and are difficult to discriminate from phagocytes from the periphery or migrating perivascular cells. It is estimated that at least one third of the phagocytes appearing in the area of a lesion are of CNS origin."
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the nervous system is the accuracy of its synaptic connections. The networks of circuits formed by neuronal interactions are responsible for the generation of behavior. Synapse formation is finely regulated.
"It involves processes at the cellular and subcellular levels, which result in: axons finding their appropriate targets from an array of choices; synapses being formed on the correct cellular compartment; and formation of pre- and postsynaptic specializations that allow for efficient information transfer. We will discuss the following topics: Axon Pathfinding – how axons find their way to specific targets. guidance forces – forces that are produced by guidance molecules."
"guidance molecules – proteins that help with axonal guidance. Target recognition – how do axons ""know"" they have found the correct target? One general property of neurons is that they migrate from the sites at which they begin to differentiate to their final residence in the nervous system."
Some neurons migrate to these final positions before they extend processes . Other neurons extend axons as they migrate . Granule cells in the developing cerebellum migrate long distances along the processes of radial glial cells; this migration begins in the external granule layer and ends at the granule cell layer.
"For example, epithelial cells at the luminal surface of the neural tube proliferate to give rise to neuroblasts; some neuroblasts become radial glial cells and extend their processes from the luminal to pial surface. During the development of the cerebellum, granule neurons migrate through the molecular layer along the processes of radial glial cells. A number of neurological mutants have provided invaluable information about neuronal migration."
"For example, in the ""weaver"" mutant mouse the genetic defect is in granule neurons and not radial glia. In weaver, the granule cells are not able to migrate to their normal position below the Purkinje cell layer. This defect results in abnormal synaptic circuitry and impaired motor behavior."
"Once neurons have migrated to their final position, and sometimes before, they begin to extend axons. Neurons extend axons because of a specialized structure at the end of axons called growth cones. Granule cells in the developing cerebellum migrate long distances along the processes of radial glial cells."
"This migration begins in the external granule layer and ends at the granule cell layer. Neurons differentiate from multipotent stem cells and migrate to their final residence in the nervous system. When these neurons reach their residence, they extend an axon and dendrites to send and receive  information from other neurons."
"In general, dendrites remain relatively close to the cell body of the neuron, whereas axons may travel long distances to enable interneuronal communication. Since axons may travel long distances and must search out their target from among many possibilities, the growing end of the axon, or growth cone, must have a mechanism to sense its surroundings. The distal tip of a growing axon is called the growth cone."
"Actin is highly concentrated in both the lamellipodia and the finger-like extensions . Although the direction of growth cone movement is influenced by the extracellular environment, the growth cone itself possesses intrinsic mechanisms that enable forward movement. Actin is polymerized at the leading edge of the growth cone and moved towards the rear where is it depolymerized."
"This continuous cycling movement of polymerized actin away from the leading edge towards the rear and the movement of actin monomer to the leading edge again generates a ""tank-tread"" type of movement. If this actin-based movement is linked to the substrate on which the growth cone is moving, the ""tank-tread"" movement is endowed with traction and growth cone movement ensues. Ramón y Cajal first described growth cones and observed that they move in a circuitous route towards their targets."
"This observation suggested that the growth cones play an active role in the pathfinding process. Roger Sperry later showed that after lesions of the optic nerve in the frog, retinotectal axons regenerate, find their targets, and make synaptic connections with precision. Based on these observations, Sperry suggested the existence of surface markers that are used by the growth cones for pathway and target recognition."
"Later studies in grasshopper embryo, Drosophila, chick, and zebrafish showed that growth cones follow specific pathways in a variety of species. Since axon pathfinding is similar in disparate species, the mechanisms underlying axon guidance are likely conserved. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine the guidance of growing axons is important because it underlies the initial wiring of the nervous system, but also because it is necessary if there is to be regeneration of function after injury."
"Axonal growth cones serve to sense environmental cues and direct the movement of axons in their quest to make synapses with their targets. Guidance cues are necessary to control the growth of axons for long distances to precise destinations. The molecular mechanisms by which these cues act probably involve altering the rate or location of actin polymerization by acting on receptors on the growth cone surface, that are linked to intracellular signaling cascades."
"Axonal trajectories appear to be broken up into a series of smaller movements. The axon finds intermediate targets that act as choice points. Axons slow and transform their morphology at these points, and apparently look for another round of directions."
Pioneering growth cones  are thought to be influenced by these intermediate targets . The pioneering growth cones are also influenced by other cues such that the intermediate targets exert only one of a number of influences on the path of growing axons. The bundling together of axons into tracts is called fasciculation.
"Axonal fasciculation is also a guidance cue as segments of some axonal trajectories migrate along preexisting axon tracts. Thus, axons may follow the pathways laid down by the pioneering axons, although there is some selectivity. An axon may pass a number of axon tracts and make specific choices about which of these axon tracts to follow."
"It is not yet clear whether the pioneer cells are absolutely required for pathfinding in follower cells. If pioneer cells are not present, the follower cells are more prone to make pathfinding errors, although these errors are largely corrected and the axons find their targets. Guidepost cells and preexisting axons can affect the outgrowth of developing axons."
"In addition to these influences, axons also receive long-range guidance information. This short- or long-range guidance information can be attractive or repulsive and serves to push or pull the growth cone in the correct direction towards its target. Short-range guidance mechanisms, like the interaction with guidepost cells and fasciculation, involve contact-mediated detection by the growth cone filopodia."
"This contact may be attractive or repulsive. Long- range, diffusable factors may also influence axonal guidance by both attraction and repulsion. It is likely that axons are affected by both local and long-range forces acting simultaneously."
"Axonal projections are often topographically organized, such that neighboring neurons in the region of origin project to neighboring neurons in the target region . This organization presents further complexity to the rules of axon outgrowth and raises the question of how the topographic information is encoded. The original experiments of Roger Sperry and later work by many other laboratories has led to the notion that positional information is found at the level of the target region."
"What is this positional information? One possibility is that each axon has a label that corresponds to an identical label on its appropriate target, allowing specificity of connections. This seems unpractical; there would need to be a very large number of labels, and there is no clear targeting mechanism for the axons."
"A more likely option was suggested by Sperry in his Chemoaffinity Hypothesis that suggests that positional information is encoded in the form of gradients of signaling molecules at the target which would be detected by complementary gradients of receptors on the axons. This model implies that positional information can be encoded by a small number of molecules and that this information can be ""read"" by axons as they maneuver in the target region. This chemotropic guidance of axons by diffusable factors that are secreted by cells can involve attractive or repulsive forces."
"Short- and long-range cues act to guide axon growth. These guidance effects can be attractive or repulsive. Axons may use several, or all, of these forces for navigation of single segments of movement."
"For example, a repellent from behind will ""push"" an axon into a corridor marked by permissive local cues and bounded by repulsive factors, while an attractant at the end of the corridor may ""pull"" the axon toward its target. After it was clear that these types of forces work to direct axon growth, attention turned to identifying the molecules that mediate these guidance effects. In the past ten years, some of the molecules on the surface of neurons and the substrates on which they grow have been identified."
"Many of the molecules are responsible for general adhesive interactions between a growth cone and its environment, and others help in choosing which surfaces axons grow on. Many of the molecules involved in adhesion are glycoproteins and belong to three major families of proteins: The immunoglobulin  superfamily; one major member of this family is the neuronal cell adhesion molecules or N-CAMs . There are at least 50 CAMs in mammals."
"N-CAMs : N-CAMs were first discovered because of their roles in the development of retinal neurons. Each N-CAM binds to another N-CAM, which is called homophilic binding. The cadherins  CADHERINS: There are many cadherins, the major type found in brain, [N-cadherin], is present on most neurons and is expressed very early in development."
Adhesion between individual cadherins is by homophilic binding and is Ca2+-dependent. Most neurons express both N-CAMs and N-cadherin. The integrins; they mediate interactions between the cell-surface and the extracellular matrix  INTEGRINS: Integrins are transmembrane proteins involved in adhesion between cell-surfaces and components of the ECM; the adhesive interactions between integrins and other macromolecules is by heterophilic binding.
The expression of different combinations of integrins on different cells determines which ECM molecules they bind. Components of the ECM that bind integrins include: Fibronectin  Laminin  Local guidance cues are provided by cell surface proteins that act on the growing axon as it follows its path towards its eventual target. The homophilic interaction of the CAMs has suggested a role in mediating axon fasciculation and adhesion of axons to cells and/or axon pathways.
"The ventral midline of the nervous systems acts as an important intermediate target for axons. Growth cones are able to sense specific cues at the midline that influence their decision to cross or not to cross. In addition to being a source of attractants and repellents, the ventral midline is also able to alter an axon's ability to respond to these cues."
"For example, after crossing the floor plate, axons that were responsive to the chemoattractant Netrin 1 prior to crossing are, after crossing, no longer able to respond to this cue. The growth of single sensory axons in an in vitro system led to the identification of an activity in extracts of embryonic spinal cord and of postnatal and adult brain, that promotes the elongation and formation of extensive branches by these axons. Biochemical purification of the activity led to the identification of an amino-terminal fragment of Slit2 as the main active component."
"Thus, Slit proteins may function as positive regulators of axon collateral formation during the establishment or remodeling of neural circuits. The receptor for slit is present on axonal growth cones and has been identified as the Roundabout  protein. Receptor tyrosine kinases, extracellular matrix molecules, and netrins, semaphorins and their receptors are also involved in axon guidance."
The functions of each are explained below. Receptor tyrosine kinases can function to modulate or guide axon growth. In general these receptors are found on developing axons and allow the axon to respond to various growth factors in the local environment.
"For example, one type of fibroblast growth factor receptor  is necessary for FGF or N-CAM-induced neurite outgrowth. The neurotrophins, NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5, are usually thought of as survival factors for neurons, although these growth factors can also promote axon outgrowth, allow axons to invade their target regions, and promote axon terminal arborization. Extracellular matrix  molecules can act to promote or inhibit neurite outgrowth."
"Laminin, tenascin, collagen, fibronectin, and a number of proteoglycans have been suggested to modulate axonal outgrowth. For example, laminin can promote, while tenascin can inhibit neurite extension. Receptors for ECM molecules include the integrins as well as Ig family members."
The laminin family and its receptors are one of the best studied examples of ECM molecules with regard to neuronal development. There are at least ten different isoforms of laminins that have growth promoting or inhibiting effects on different cell types. The axonal receptors for laminins are integrins.
Integrins are heterodimers whose subunit composition determines binding specificity with respect to the laminins. The integrins link ECM signals to the cytoskeleton and various signal transduction pathways. The role of laminins and other ECM molecules in neuronal development is to affect axonal guidance.
The netrins are a family of secreted proteins related to laminins in sequence They are both diffusable and cell associated. The netrins were identified using two approaches. A genetic assay in nematode uncovered a mutant gene that resulted in defects in cell migration and axon guidance and an in vitro assay using chick floor plate cell extracts identified a factor that results in outgrowth and guidance of spinal cord axons.
"Netrins are well conserved from nematode to human and are encoded by only one or two genes in most species. Netrin binds to two types of axonal receptors  that determine whether the actions of netrin are attractive or repulsive. The semaphorins are a large family of cell surface or secreted proteins that mediate growth cone collapse, axonal steering, axonal branching, and axon terminal arborization."
"At least ten semaphorins are found in humans and they appear to function predominantly as inhibitory  factors for axonal guidance. Neuropilins serve as receptors for secreted semaphorins, whereas members of the plexin family are receptors for other semaphorins. Secreted semaphorins do not bind directly to plexins, but plexins can associate with neuropilins."
"Thus, plexins are receptors for multiple classes of semaphorins, either alone or in combination with neuropilins, and trigger a signal transduction pathway controlling axon guidance. The growth of developing axons depends on: Physical guidance cues such as guidepost cells and pioneer axons. Local and long-range molecules involved in attraction and repulsion of developing axons ."
The presence of receptors on developing axons that allow for modulation of growth by environmental factors. The establishment of synaptic connections and their maintenance depends the interactions of axons and their targets. These interactions are responsible for synapse stabilization and neuron survival.
"Synaptic transmission depends on the association of the pre- and post-synaptic elements. The pre- and postsynaptic regions of cells are highly specialized architecturally, which allows for efficient information transfer. The architecture of the synapse is formed during development and can change in an activity-dependent manner."
"The presynaptic nerve terminal matures from the growth cone and becomes highly specialized to subserve functions necessary for chemical neurotransmission. The presynaptic nerve terminal contains mitochondria and endosomes, although the most striking aspect of this structure is the presence of numerous neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles. Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie differentiation of the presynaptic nerve terminal."
"It is known that the switch between constitutive vesicle cycling that takes place in the growth cone, and regulated secretion from the mature presynaptic terminal represents a dramatic alteration in function. In order for efficient reception of the neurotransmitter signal, the receptors on the postsynaptic cell are clustered at sites opposite the presynaptic active zone. The clustering of postsynaptic receptors is an adaptive behavior that has been studied in detail using the neuromuscular junction as a model system."
"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  is a ligand-gated ion channel that responds to a signal provided by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the transmitter used at the neuromuscular junction. AChRs are found at a density of 10,000-20,000/um2 in the postsynaptic membrane while there are about 10/um2 at extrasynaptic sites. The extraordinary concentration of AChRs at the synapse suggests that the muscle has the capacity to anchor these receptors, while their presence in direct opposition to the presynaptic active zone suggests that the nerve plays a role in organizing the postsynaptic membrane."
"The cleft separating pre- and postsynaptic membranes contains the basal lamina which coats the entire muscle fiber and is composed of collagens, proteoglycans, and other extracellular matrix molecules including laminin as well as nerve-derived molecules such as agrin . The basal lamina plays a critical role in the assembly of the postsynaptic membrane. Much of our knowledge about synapse formation comes from studies on nerve-muscle regeneration."
Basal lamina patches that are allowed to contact damaged muscle tissue induce the regenerating myotubes to form postsynaptic specializations. These studies suggested that there is an AChR clustering agent in the basal lamina. Agrin was purified from basal lamina extracts as a molecule that is capable of inducing formation of clusters of AChRs on myotubes.
"Further study showed that agrin is present in motor neurons, is transported down motor neuron axons and is retained in the synaptic basal lamina. Antibodies against agrin inhibit AChR clustering. Agrin deficient mice have disorganized neuromuscular junctions and have decreased number, size, and density of AChRs at the neuromuscular junction."
"Thus, agrin appears to be a nerve-derived factor that organizes postsynaptic differentiation. Agrin may bind to several candidate receptors including alpha-dystroglycan, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase  to produce its effects. The muscle plasma membrane has AChRs on its surface, which are uniformly distributed before the motor nerve growth cone arrives."
"Shortly after innervation, the distribution of extrajunctional receptors decreases and the density of receptors at the newly forming neuromuscular synapse increases dramatically. This effect occurs precisely at the site where the growth cone releases ACh. These changes occur by the redistribution of existing receptors and the synthesis and insertion of new receptors at synapses."
"The axon of the motor neuron induces ACh receptors to cluster on muscle fibers. As the axon approaches the muscle fiber most of the AChRs are distributed diffusely on its surface. When the axon begins to establish synaptic transmission, the distribution of AChRs begins to change."
"AChRs begin to cluster at the newly formed synaptic contact, while extrasynaptic receptors decrease dramatically. What factors are responsible for the changes in AChR density during nerve-muscle formation? It is NOT the release of ACh from nerve terminals."
"Increased AChR density during neuromuscular junction formation results from release of molecules from motor nerve terminals, including AChR inducing activity , a molecule that promotes an increase in total AChR and receptor clusters, and Agrin, a protein that induces clustering of pre-existing AChRs and other components of the NMJ. During nerve-muscle synapse formation, these biological properties of AChRs change after innervation: The turnover rate of receptors decreases. Their conductance properties increase."
"Receptor open time decreases. The subunit composition of individual receptors at the NMJ changes during development. At the neuromuscular junction, synapses compete for innervation of a muscle fiber."
"Although this competition results in a reduction in the number of synaptic inputs to a muscle, the complexity of each synaptic input increases and the strength of each synapse increases. Synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction involves a loss of AChRs and a withdrawal of the presynaptic terminal. Activity-dependent competition between motor axons favors more active inputs."
Direct competition between nerve fibers favors the axon that is able to compete for trophic factors supplied by the target cell. Indirect competition allows the muscle to select the favored axon. An additional strategy for synapse elimination may be that the elimination is provoked by a retrograde messenger.
"Additional information about retrograde signaling are found in Chapter 14, part 3. In the adult, almost all muscle fibers are innervated by a single motor neuron. However, early in development many postsynaptic targets are innervated by multiple nerve terminals ."
"During synapse maturation many nerve terminals disappear. Synapse elimination is thought to occur by the withdrawal of presynaptic terminals. Although the number of distinct synaptic inputs to a given target decreases during this process, the complexity of individual remaining terminals actually increases ."
The net result of this process is an increase in the overall strength of individual synapses. This process of synapse elimination and rearrangement plays an important role in sculpting the circuitry of the nervous system and the fine tuning of individual synaptic contacts. The development of connectivity in the central nervous system requires the initiation of synaptic contacts and the maintenance of the correct number of synapses.
"It is not clear why, but it seems that more synapses are created than are eventually required for proper neuronal function. Under these circumstances, some synapses are eliminated. The process of synapse elimination allows for a ""use dependent"" form of Darwinism; those synapses that are necessary are retained while those that are simply redundant are removed."
"The neuromuscular junction and the visual system have been used as models to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse elimination. In most developing tissues, substantial cell death occurs during development. One type of cell death occurs in an activity-dependent manner and is related to synapse elimination ."
"Cell death has been suggested to be the default pathway for all cells, and cells that escape do so by receiving appropriate trophic support. With the growing realization that pathological cell death shares features in common with cell death that occurs during development, a better understanding of developmental cell death may reveal potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and trauma. The formation of synaptic connections between a presynaptic neuron and its target is often critical to the survival of the presynaptic neuron."
"In many cases if a synapse is not formed, or if an incorrect synapse is made, then the presynaptic neuron will eventually die. The survival of neurons is often dependent on trophic factors that are produced by the target tissue. Trophic factors are essential for neuron survival; their function is to promote cell growth."
"Early studies on cultured sensory and sympathetic neurons suggested that they require a target-derived factor  for their survival. Competition for NGF occurs when multiple axons innervate a single target that has limited amounts of NGF. Innervating axons possess NGF receptors that bind, internalize, and retrogradely transport NGF."
"The biochemical cascade produced by NGF internalization and transport results in signals that prevent cell death. One of the first physiological roles that was discovered for NGF was its importance in the survival of sensory and sympathetic neurons. If anti-NGF antibodies are injected into newborn animals to ""neutralize"" the actions of NGF the survival of sympathetic neurons is greatly reduced."
"For developing neurons in the superior cervical ganglion the natural source of NGF can be blocked by the daily injections of anti-NGF antibodies into newborn animals. This treatment results in the premature death of these neurons. In contrast, if newborn animals are injected with NGF itself, the added NGF actually prevents the naturally occurring death of certain types of neurons."
The cellular actions of growth factors  are mediated by specific cell surface receptors. The high affinity NGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase that confers the biological activity of NGF to cells by acting through downstream signaling processes that eventually involve alterations in gene transcription. This kinase is known as trkA.
"Other growth factors bind to different receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, TrkB is specifically activated by low concentrations of BDNF and NT-4/5, and can be activated by high concentrations of NT-3. TrkC is related to trkA, but is most effectively activated by NT-3; all trks are transmembrane proteins that contain an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular  tyrosine kinase domain."
"When trks are activated by the appropriate ligand  they initiate a series of intracellular signaling cascades. NGF is related to other trophic factors such as BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, and CNTF. These factors are structurally related to NGF and are survival factors for neurons that do not respond to NGF."
"Trophic signals produced by some of these molecules are not all target-derived like NGF. Neurons may receive trophic signals from molecules in the extracellular matrix, from glia, and in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Withdrawal of these factors results in cell death for neuronal populations that are dependent on these factors."
"Disruption of different neurotrophin genes in mice has allowed analysis of the role of these factors in sensory-motor pathways. The dorsal root ganglia  of wild-type mice possess small , medium , and large  cells. The small cells that carry pain and temperature information are lost when NGF or its high affinity receptor, trkA, are missing."
"Large cells that innervate muscle spindles are lost when NT-3 or TrkC are missing. These data underline the importance of different neurotrophins in supporting the development of distinct cell populations. This section focuses on the serious, and often irreversible, damage to central and peripheral nervous systems caused by injury to neurons."
"In almost every case, neurons have withdrawn from the mitotic cycle and therefore can no longer divide to produce new neurons to replace damaged cells. Therefore, neuron loss due to injury has profound results, since the loss of affected pathways will permanently change the functional circuitry of the nervous system. In those cases where neurons do regenerate following injury, the mechanisms that contribute to regeneration appear to be very similar to the events that promote axon growth and synapse formation during development."
Several general rules govern neuronal responses to injury: Regeneration in mammals is much poorer than lower vertebrates. Regeneration in the CNS is much less likely than in the PNS. Trophic factors play important roles in neuronal regeneration.
Neurons in the peripheral nervous system can regenerate their axons. This contrasts with the general inability of damaged neurons in the CNS to regenerate. The regeneration of peripheral neurons is due in large part to the role of trophic factors which provide an important function in preventing their degeneration after axotomy.
"Some of the same molecules required for immature neurons to develop and survive are also involved in the survival of adult neurons after injury. For example, if the axons of an adult sympathetic neuron are cut, the axon terminals of afferent neurons withdraw their axon terminals. However, if exogenous NGF is added, then regeneration and reinnervation occurs."
"If anti-NGF antibodies are added to neutralize NGF, then regeneration is blocked. Blocking the retrograde transport of NGF from the target cell to the damaged sympathetic neuron's cell body also inhibits regeneration. Thus, NGF is required for the regeneration and maintenance of peripheral synaptic connections in the adult PNS."
"Schwann cells also contribute to the regeneration of peripheral axons. During damage and regeneration of axons, macrophages are activated and invade damaged areas. They secrete mitogenic factors that stimulate Schwann cell proliferation."
"Glial cell proliferation results in the increased secretion of extracellular matrix molecules and helps to promote adhesion between the regenerating axons and the remaining supporting cells. The synthesis and secretion of NGF is also stimulated under these conditions and provides important short-term conditions for regeneration. Thus, NGF plays another role in regeneration because it is produced by components of the peripheral nervous system that are not themselves postsynaptic targets."
Damage to CNS neurons is often irreversible. Why are CNS neurons different than peripheral neurons in this regard? In the adult brain important ECM molecules like laminin and fibronectin are no longer expressed and thus important adhesion molecules are absent from the regenerating environment.
"In addition, oligodendroglia  express growth inhibitory molecules in the adult that block axon regrowth. As discussed above, the environment and properties of peripheral nerves are much more supportive of the regeneration process. For example, Schwann Cells secrete NGF, ECM and other adhesive molecules that are critical for neuronal survival and axon regeneration."
"In addition, Schwann cells do not express molecules that inhibit axon growth like oligodendroglia in the CNS. The use of peripheral nerve grafts to promote regeneration of damaged nerves in the CNS is one possible way to overcome the limited regeneration potential of CNS neurons. For example, following transection of the optic nerve, if a section of peripheral nerve is attached to the cut end of the optic nerve and its other end is inserted into superior colliculus, then regeneration of the optic nerve can occur."
"Evidence supporting the functional regeneration of the cut optic nerves includes: Retinal ganglion axons regenerated and reinnervated the superior colliculus. New synapses are formed which last for at least one year. These new synapses are functional; if retinal neurons are activated by light, then postsynaptic neurons in the colliculus respond ."
Experimental subjects with PNS nerve grafts have partially restored light avoidance behavior. Administration of growth factors during nerve grafts can enhance regeneration. NGF also appears to play an important role in the survival of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain where neurons degenerate in Alzheimer's disease.
"Following damage to an axon by cutting, a sequence of changes occurs during degeneration. Under certain conditions, both retrograde and anterograde transneuronal degeneration can occur. Cutting an axon divides it into proximal and distal segments Immediately after injury, axons begin to seal off, however, Ca2+ enters damaged axonal elements and activates Ca2+-dependent proteases Rapid failure of synaptic transmission occurs within hours  Within days presynaptic terminals begin to degenerate and in about 1 week invading glia disrupt and phagocytose synaptic contacts The distal segment degenerates slowly and may take up to 1 month; the loss of distal segments is called Wallerian degeneration There are also major changes that occur in the neuronal cell body during degeneration; a few days after axotomy, the process of chromatolysis starts in the soma: RER  breaks down and moves to periphery of the cell body ."
"There is an increase in free polyribosomes, mRNA transcription and protein synthesis . A damaged neuron's success in regeneration is linked to its ability to find an appropriate target to reinnervate; failure to contact a target usually results in cell death. If the injured neuron survives damage , the process of reinnervation begins: The axon's proximal segment forms sprouts and the process of regrowth begins."
"Axonal sprouts migrate into the conduit formed by the residual endoneural sheath that surrounded the previous axon. Axon sprouts migrate to find a target; if a suitable target is found, the neuron survives; if not, the neuron dies/ Cellular damage is not restricted to injured neurons; degeneration is often transneuronal or transsynaptic. In the visual pathway, damage of retinal ganglion neurons often results in degeneration of downstream target neurons in the lateral geniculate and even to neurons in the visual cortex."
"This is called transsynaptic anterograde degeneration. This process can also happen in the reverse direction , and is called transsynaptic retrograde degeneration. Traumatic injury to neurons is often irreversible."
"However, in those instances in which neurons do regenerate following injury, the mechanisms that contribute to regeneration are similar to those events that contribute to axonal growth and synapse formation during development. During normal development synapse formation is a gradual process that results in one muscle fiber becoming innervated by one motor axon. Following axotomy, the postsynaptic structures called synaptic gutters remain on the surface of the muscle fiber."
"During reinnervation, the nerve forms new synaptic contacts at the old synaptic gutters: the one-to-one relationship between nerve and muscle fiber is maintained. A large number of crippling neurological conditions result from the loss of certain cell populations from the nervous system through disease or injury, and these cells are not intrinsically replaced. Replacement of depleted cell populations by transplantation may be of functional benefit in many such diseases."
"A diverse range of cell populations is vulnerable, and the loss of specific populations results in circumscribed deficits in different conditions. This diversity presents a considerable challenge if cell replacement therapy is to become widely applicable in the clinical domain, because each condition has specific requirements for the phenotype, developmental stage, and number of cells required. New discoveries have made inroads in the use of immortalized cell lines to replace or supplement the decreased or lost functions of damaged nervous system tissues."
"There have also been limited advances in the area of transplantation using fetal tissues . Areas in which these new approaches have been tried include: the synthesis and secretion of catecholamines in patients with Parkinson's disease the synthesis and secretion of growth/trophic factors  in patients with Alzheimer's disease the synthesis and secretion of ECM and adhesion molecules to promote regeneration in patients with damaged CNS or PNS tissues These approaches are technically complicated at both cellular and molecular levels. One of the problems encountered is that although tissue or cell transplants seem to have positive short-term benefits, their long-term effects have been limited."
"An ideal cell for universal application in cell replacement therapy would possess several key properties: it would be highly proliferative, allowing the ex vivo production of large numbers of cells from minimal donor material; it would also remain immature and phenotypically plastic such that it could differentiate into appropriate neural and glial cell types on, or prior to, transplantation. Critically, both proliferation and differentiation would be controllable. Neural stem cells exist not only in the developing mammalian nervous system but also in the adult nervous system of all mammalian organisms, including humans."
"Neural stem cells can also be derived from more primitive embryonic stem cells. The cells can be expanded, established in continuous cell lines and differentiated into the three classical neuronal phenotypes . The mechanisms that regulate endogenous stem cells are poorly understood."
"Potential uses of stem cells in repair include transplantation to repair missing cells and the activation of endogenous cells to provide ""self-repair. "" Before the full potential of neural stem cells can be realized, we must understand what controls their proliferation, as well as the various pathways of differentiation available to their daughter cells. Postsynaptic targets supply critical neurotrophic factors."
"In addition to NGF, several neurotrophic factors have been identified . Reactions of neurons to injury can vary dramatically; neurons usually survive if functional connections are formed during the regeneration process. Although regeneration is possible in the PNS, regeneration in the CNS is poor or nonexistent."
Future biomedical research will continue to actively pursue approaches to restore the function of damaged neuronal tissues. The future of understanding important molecules and mechanisms that underlie regeneration lies in basic neurobiological research. Areas to receive attention include: The identification of new cell-surface and extracellular matrix molecules that promote axon growth and regeneration.
"The identification and production of new trophic factors that are essential for cell survival and growth. The examination of potential use of embryonic stem cells to functionally replace lost neurons. In addition, tissue transplantation and peripheral nerve grafts will continue to be studied since they represent one of the most viable approaches to CNS regeneration."
"As you learned in previous chapters, neurotransmission occurs through the secretion of neurotransmitter from a nerve ending to influence the postsynaptic cell. In this chapter the biological mechanisms of vesicle mediated synaptic transmission will be presented. Within the last twenty years it has become apparent that all intracellular membrane trafficking is based on the same fundamental mechanisms."
The same operations involved in the synthesis and transport of vesicles at the ER and Golgi apparatus in the soma are employed in a modified fashion during neurosecretion. The major difference is that vesicle trafficking during neurosecretion is regulated by Ca2+ influx whereas vesicle trafficking during the synthesis and transport of vesicles is not. Unregulated trafficking is termed constitutive.
"In both cases, however, trafficking is made up of a series of steps involving budding of vesicles, their docking with other organelles, and fusion with the membranes of these organelles. These processes are believed to be present during vesicle biogenesis when the ER generates vesicles that fuse with the Golgi apparatus, when the endosomes are trafficked to the lysosomes, and when vesicle membrane is recaptured from the nerve ending plasma membrane. There is a budding from their membrane origin, a movement to the destination point, and finally the docking of the vesicles with the target organelle where it attaches to and fuses with the organelle membrane."
"This section will cover the life of a neurotransmitter vesicle beginning with its synthesis in the cell soma, transport to the nerve ending, recycling at the nerve ending. Vesicle proteins are eventually returned to the cell soma for reuse in the synthesis of new vesicles. The cycle of neurotransmitter vesicles begins in the ER where the proteins that make up the vesicles are synthesized."
"Vesicle biosynthesis continues as the proteins migrate through the smooth ER and the Golgi apparatus to eventually emerge to be transported to the nerve ending. The outer layer of the nuclear envelope is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is in turn contiguous with the Golgi apparatus. As shown in Figure 10,3, after the mRNA is transcribed from the DNA in the nucleus, it migrates through pores in the nuclear envelope called the perinuclear cisternae  in Figure 10."
"3). As the mRNA reaches the cytoplasm it encounters free ribosomes, labeled . This is the site of cytoplasmic protein synthesis."
"Here, triplet nucleotide combinations, called codons, translate the mRNA into protein through a mechanism where ribosomes read off the protein sequence encoded in the mRNA. As ribosomes move along the mRNA template amino acids are added and the protein synthesized. Because most mRNA molecules are longer than a ribosome, many ribosomes can read the codons of a single molecule of RNA."
"Click ""B"" in the graphic at right for animation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Proteins that are destined to be associated with membrane structures, such as neurotransmitter vesicles or the plasmalemma, are synthesized on ribosomes within the endoplasmic reticulum. Recall that the presence of ribosomes defines this part of the endoplasmic reticulum as rough endoplasmic reticulum."
"In  of Figure 10,3, the polypeptide  being synthesized has no signal peptide. Consequently, this protein will become a non-membrane bound  protein that resides within lumen of vesicles. While in the lumen, the protein undergoes further processing as it proceeds through the smooth ER, Golgi apparatus, and the secretory vesicle as mature secretory proteins are formed."
"In  of Figure 10,3, a signal peptide is a part of the polypeptide being synthesized . Consequently, this protein will be an integral membrane protein. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA template, amino acids are added."
"The signal peptide inserts in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and maintains the protein's association with membrane. This will ensure that the protein will associate with a vesicular structure, such as a neurotransmitter storage vesicle. Shows the protein synthesis from ribosomes in the rough ER to synthesize membrane bound protein."
"Figures 10,4 illustrates the movement of the secretory vesicles through the rough and the smooth ER. The smooth ER extends from the RER and serves as a site for lipid biosynthesis for the production of endosomes, lysosomes and plasma membrane as well as for the neurotransmitter vesicles. New membrane protein that begins its synthesis in the RER continues in the SER where pieces of the SER bud off to form transport vesicles that shuttle to the Golgi apparatus with their contents."
"As shown in Figure 10,5, in the Golgi apparatus the vesicles fuse to form the outermost of the Golgi apparatus cisternae stacks. Each cisterna migrates in a stepwise fashion through the Golgi apparatus toward the concave surface. During this migration, proteins become more concentrated and undergo various types of biochemical modification to produce mature functional proteins."
"These modifications include phosphorylation, glycosylation, proteolysis and addition of fatty acids, as well as others. The migration proceeds from the cis face close to the SER to the concave trans face. Upon reaching the concave face the cisternae round up into small vacuoles, then coalesce to form a larger condensing vacuole."
"The condensing vacuoles then give rise to a number of dense spherical transport vesicles. These vesicles bud off and are transported to the various destinations within the neuron where they become cell membrane, lysosomes, endosomes or neurotransmitter vesicles. Vesicles formed in the cell soma are moved to the site at which they will be used in synaptic transmission."
"This step in the trafficking of the vesicle is mediated by a process termed fast anterograde axoplasmic transport. As depicted in Figure 10. 6, transport is mediated through the interaction of the vesicle with the microtubule."
"Transport is an energy dependent process in which a so-called motor protein, kinesin, associates with vesicles and moves down the microtubule in a series of attachment-detachment steps. Evidence for the existence of axoplasmic transport comes from a variety of observations, including the movement of radioactive proteins synthesized in the cell soma down the axon to the nerve endings. The speed of transport is 0."
5-1. 5 cm per hour. Ca2+ is also required for transport.
"The vinca alkaloid drugs colchicine and vinblastine prevent axoplasmic transport through their disruption of microtubules. As discussed in Chapter 5, neurotransmitter is secreted at the nerve ending through the Ca2+-dependent fusion of neurotransmitter storage vesicle with the plasma membrane with the neurotransmitter being secreted  into the synaptic cleft to influence the postsynaptic cell. This process is termed exocytosis."
An important concept to emerge is that the same mechanisms that occur in vesicle fusion with membranes in the Golgi during vesicle biosynthesis are also employed at the nerve ending for neurotransmitter release. This is true for vesicle synthesis. Even very simple cells like yeast.
"This conservation of mechanisms has permitted the use of simple systems to help understand the molecular mechanisms of neurotransmitter release. As shown in Figure 10,7, the first event that must occur  is the filling of vesicles with neurotransmitter through specific neurotransmitter uptake . This uptake will be covered in subsequent chapters that discuss each of the specific neurotransmitters."
"The vesicles remain in reserve until needed for secretion. When needed for secretion, a translocation occurs, which is also referred to as mobilization. The vesicles move to a region of plasma membrane called the active zone."
The active zone is the release site and is characterized by the appearance of dense material adjacent to the plasma membrane. The influx of Ca2+ is believed to increase translocation by increasing the Ca2+ dependent phosphorylation of a vesicle binding protein termed synapsin. The theory is that Ca2+ dependent phosphorylation of synapsin frees the vesicles from binding to actin microfilaments.
"The vesicles then bind to the active zone of the plasma membrane, where they are in position to undergo release of their neurotransmitter. The association of the vesicle with the plasma membrane is termed docking and serves to prime the vesicle for secretion. The docking is believed to occur through the binding of proteins in the vesicle membrane to proteins in the plasma membrane."
Several of these proteins have been discovered because they are targets for clostridia bacterial toxins that block synaptic transanimation. Several of these toxins and the proteins they detect are shown in Table I. The toxins are so toxic that a single molecule can poison a whole nerve terminal.
"One of the synaptic vesicle proteins is VAMP, and two of the synaptic plasmal membrane proteins are syntaxin and SNAP-25. A third plasma membrane protein, n-sec-1, is important because its loose association with the plasma membrane prevents the binding of the neurotransmitter vesicle proteins until n-sec-1 is displaced . This and subsequent steps in the secretory process are shown in Figure 10."
"8. The vesicle and plasma membrane proteins are hypothesized to complex with one another upon the displacement of n-sec-1 to form a ""trimeric complex"" . This three-member complex has been isolated, intact, from the nerve endings of animals."
"This association of the proteins initiates fusion. Vesicles at this stage are primed for release. The final stage of release, also shown in Figure 10."
"8, is the fission of the membrane at the point of contact between the vesicle and the plasma membrane. Exocytosis of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft occurs when this fission takes place. This step is Ca2+ stimulated, but the mechanism of the Ca2+ trigger is unknown."
"One hypothesis is that a vesicle protein called synaptotagmin binds Ca2+ to initiate fission. Support for synaptotagmin, as the Ca2+ sensor, is that it possesses two binding sites for Ca2+. Additional evidence comes from studies of mice in which synaptotagmin has been knocked out."
"In these mice fast Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis is severely limited. Many aspects of the fusion-fission mechanism remain to be understood, including: what causes the dissociation of n-sec-1 from the complex, how Ca2+ functions in the release process and how all the proteins that are involved in release become reassociated with the proper membrane following release as the vesicle membrane is recycled. Although the source of vesicles for neurotransmitter secretion comes from biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus at the cell body, evidence indicates that local re-synthesis of synaptic vesicle is an important aspect of neurotransmitter secretion."
Figures 10. 9 and 10. 10 provides two schematic summaries of how vesicles are locally reused.
"Both utilize the recapture of vesicle membrane from the nerve ending. In one, vesicles bud off the plasma membrane through the formation of pits that migrate directly to become a neurotransmitter vesicle as soon as it can be refilled with neurotransmitter through the neurotransmitter uptake process. This is shown in Figure 10."
"9. This mechanism is referred to as the ""kiss and run"" hypothesis. The second mechanism involves the formation of clathrin coated pits to recapture vesicle membrane, and the vesicles cycle through the endosomal compartment in the nerve ending before becoming functional synaptic vesicles."
The vesicles then bud off the endosome to form the neurotransmitter vesicle. This is shown in Figure 10. 10.
It is believed that both mechanisms can exist in the same nerve ending or only one of the two can be present. Both are important in that they recover vesicle protein to permit a plentiful supply for synaptic transmission. This mechanism also prevents the enlargement of the nerve ending that would occur if vesicle membrane were not recaptured.
"No matter which mechanism is involved, the supply and resupply of vesicles can only keep pace with a high rate of synaptic transmission for a few minutes. Eventually the proteins utilized for synaptic transmission in the nerve ending are targeted and returned to the cell body of the neuron to be recycled to make new protein and vesicles. The proteins are returned to the soma through a retrograde axoplasmic transport that is analogous to anterograde transport but uses a different motor protein, dynein."
"Transport is mediated by the interaction of dynein with microtubules and proceeds at a rate somewhat slower than that of fast anterograde transport . In addition to returning proteins to the soma, retrograde transport serves as a means of communication between the nerve endings and the cell soma. This is a mechanism to transport signaling molecules to regulate the development and maintenance of axonal contacts with postsynaptic cells."
"Figure 10,12 shows a summary of retrograde and anterograde axoplasmic transport. It shows the motor proteins, kinesin and dynein, mediating the movement of vesicles and mitochondria anterogradely and vesicles retrogradely along microtubules. The animation shows the motor proteins as a part of the organelle that is transported."
"The other possible relationship between the motor protein and microtubules is that the motor proteins are a part of the microtubule and pass the vesicles along the microtubule. Acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter discovered, was originally described as ""vagus stuff"" by Otto Loewi because of its ability to mimic the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. It is now known to be a neurotransmitter at all autonomic ganglia, at many autonomically innervated organs, at the neuromuscular junction, and at many synapses in the CNS."
"In this chapter we will discuss the acetylcholine’s anatomy, cell biology, physiological effects, role in behavior, and clinical applications. In the autonomic nervous system, acetylcholine  is the neurotransmitter in the preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. These are shown in Figure 11."
"2 as the red ACh in the ganglion. ACh is also the neurotransmitter at the adrenal medulla and serves as the neurotransmitter at all the parasympathetic innervated organs. ACh is also the neurotransmitter at the sweat glands, and at the piloerector muscle of the sympathetic ANS ."
"In the peripheral nervous system, ACh is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction between the motor nerve and skeletal muscle. In the central nervous system, ACh is found primarily in interneurons, shown in Figure 11. 3 as orange and green cell clusters."
"A few important long-axon cholinergic pathways have also been identified. Noteworthy is the cholinergic projection from the nucleus basalis of Meynert  to the forebrain neocortex and associated limbic structures, represented by the black pathway in Figure 11. 3."
Degeneration of this pathway is one of the pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease. There is also a projection from the medial septal and diagonal band region to limbic structures . Most subcortical areas are innervated by neurons from the ponto-mesencephalic region .
"Figure 11. 4 is a summary of the biological mechanisms involved in the synthesis, storage secretion, receptor interaction and termination of acetylcholine. Click on the region of the cell describing these processes to learn more about each one."
"Choline acetyltransferase : As shown in Figure 11. 5, ACh is synthesized by a single step reaction catalyzed by the biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase. As is the case for all nerve terminal proteins, CAT is produced in the cholinergic cell body and transported down the axon to the nerve endings."
"Both CAT and ACh may be found throughout the neuron, but their highest concentration is in axon terminals. The presence of CAT is the ""marker"" that a neuron is cholinergic, only cholinergic neurons contain CAT. The rate-limiting steps in ACh synthesis are the availability of choline and acetyl-CoA."
"During increased neuronal activity the availability of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria is upregulated as is the uptake of choline into the nerve ending from the synaptic cleft. Ca2+ appears to be involved in both of these regulatory mechanisms. As will be described later, the inactivation of ACh is converted by metabolism to choline and acetic acid."
"Consequently much of the choline used for ACh synthesis comes from the recycling of choline from metabolized ACh. Another source is the breakdown of the phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. One of the strategies to increase ACh neurotransmission is the administration of choline in the diet."
"However, this has not been effective, probably because the administration of choline does not increase the availability of choline in the CNS. The majority of the ACh in nerve endings is contained in clear  100 um vesicles. A small amount is also free in the cytosol."
Vesicle-bound ACh is not accessible to degradation by acetylcholinesterase . The uptake of ACh into storage vesicle occurs through an energy-dependent pump that acidifies the vesicle. The acidified vesicle then uses a vesicular ACh transporter  to exchange protons for ACh molecules.
"No useful pharmacological agents are available to modify cholinergic function through interaction with the storage of ACh. Interestingly, the gene for VAChT is contained on the first intron of the choline acetyltransferase gene. This proximity implies the two important cholinergic proteins are probably regulated coordinately."
"The release of ACh occurs through Ca2+ stimulated docking, fusion, and fission of the vesicle with the nerve terminal membrane, as discussed previously. You will recall that the miniature endplate potentials and the quantal release in response to action potentials at the neuromuscular junction are due to the release of packets of ACh from individual storage vesicles . Many toxins are known that interfere with these processes and are effective in preventing ACh secretion."
"The examples in Figure 11,6 shows botulinum toxin inhibition and black widow spider venom  stimulation of ACh release. As indicated in Table I, nicotinic receptors are located at the NMJ, autonomic ganglia and sparsely in the CNS. The NMJ nicotinic ACh receptor consists of five polypeptide subunits: two α subunits and one each of β, δ, and γ ."
"A funnel-shaped internal ion channel is surrounded by the five subunits. The binding surface of the receptor appears to be primarily on the α subunits, near the outer surface of the molecule. The subunits contain recognition sites for agonists, reversible antagonists, and α-toxins ."
"Whereas the NMJ nicotinic receptor is composed of four different species of subunit , the neuronal nicotinic receptor also is composed of only two subunit types . Muscarinic receptors, classified as G protein coupled receptors , are located at parasympathetic autonomically innervated visceral organs, on the sweat glands and piloerector muscles and both post-synaptically and pre-synaptically in the CNS . The muscarinic receptor is composed of a single polypeptide."
"Seven regions of the polypeptide are made up of 20-25 amino acids arranged in an α helix. Because each of these regions of the protein is markedly hydrophobic, they span the cell membrane seven times as depicted in Figure 11. 9."
"The fifth internal loop and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the polypeptide receptor are believed to be the site of the interaction of the muscarinic receptor with G proteins . The site of agonist binding is a circular pocket formed by the upper portions of the seven membrane-spanning regions. ACh has excitatory actions at the neuromuscular junction, at autonomic ganglion, at certain glandular tissues and in the CNS."
"It has inhibitory actions at certain smooth muscles and at cardiac muscle. The biochemical responses to stimulation of muscarinic receptor involve the receptor occupancy causing an altered conformation of an associated GTP-binding protein . G protein is made up of the three subunits α, β and γ."
"In response to the altered conformation of the muscarinic receptor, the a subunit of the G protein releases bound guanosine diphosphate  and simultaneously binds guanosine triphosphate . The binding of GTP ""activates"" the G protein, allowing dissociation of the α subunit from the trimeric complex and for it to interact with effector systems to mediate specific responses. An inherent GTPase catalytic activity of the G protein hydrolyzes the GTP back to GDP."
"This hydrolysis terminates the action of the G protein. The rate of hydrolysis of the GTP thus dictates the length of time the G protein remains activated. Inhibition of Adenylate Cyclase: The muscarinic receptor, through interaction with an inhibitory GTP-binding protein, acts to inhibit adenylyl cyclase."
"Reduced cAMP production leads to reduced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, reduced heart rate, and contraction strength. Stimulation of Phospholipase C: The muscarinic receptor activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C  through interaction with a GTP-binding protein. As shown in Figure 11."
"12a, the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate yields two second messengers; inositol trisphosphate  and diacylglycerol . The DAG activates protein kinase C . Cellular responses are influenced by PKC's phosphorylation of target proteins."
"As shown in Figure 11. 12b, the IP3 diffuses to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum  where it interacts with IP3 receptors to increase Ca2+ release from the intracellular storage site. Activation of K+ Channels: In response to muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation, a GTP binding protein also can interact directly with K+ channels to increase K+ conductance, ."
"This conductance increase increases the resting membrane potential in myocardial and other cell membranes leading to inhibition. ACh binds only briefly to the pre- or postsynaptic receptors. Following dissociation from the receptor, the ACh is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase  as shown in Figure 11."
"14. This enzyme has a very high catalysis rate, one of the highest known in biology. AChE is synthesized in the neuronal cell body and distributed throughout the neuron by axoplasmic transport."
AChE exists as alternatively spliced isoforms that vary in their subunit composition. The variation at the NMJ is a heteromeric protein composed of four subunits coupled to a collagen tail that anchors the multi-subunit enzyme to the cell membrane of the postsynaptic cell . This four-subunit form is held together by sulfhydryl bonds and the tail anchors the enzyme in the extracellular matrix at the NMJ.
"Other isoforms are homomeric and freely soluble in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic cell. AChE, unlike ChAT, is found in non-cholinergic neurons as well. In addition, other cholinesterases exist throughout the body, which are also able to metabolize acetylcholine."
"These are termed pseudocholinesterases. Drugs that inhibit ACh breakdown are effective in altering cholinergic neurotransmission. In fact, the irreversible inhibition of AChE by isopropylfluoroesters are so toxic that they can be incompatible with life—inhibiting the muscles for respiration."
"This inhibition is produced because ACh molecules accumulate in the synaptic space, keep the receptors occupied, and cause paralysis. Two notable examples are insecticides and the gases used in biological warfare. The mechanism of action of these irreversible inhibitors of AChE is that they carbamylate the AChE, rendering it inactive."
"The carbamylation inactivates both the acetyl and choline binding domains. A recently developed antidote to these inhibitors cleaves the nerve gas so that it will dissociate from the AChE. In contrast to the irreversible inhibitors, the reversible AChE inhibitors are effective in transiently increasing the ACh level and are effective in diseases and conditions where an increased ACh level is desired."
"The clinically important compound, eserine , reversibly inhibits AChE. Nicotinic receptor activation causes the opening of the channel formed by the receptor. This increases the Na+ movement into the target cell, leading to depolarization and generation of the action potential."
"This rapidly developing change, termed a fast EPSP, is illustrated in Figures 4,3, and 6,2. Muscarinic receptor activation of postsynaptic cells can be either excitatory or inhibitory and is always slow in onset and long in duration . Figure 11."
"16 and Figure 11,17 illustrate an excitatory and an inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the sympathetic ganglion. As described earlier, G protein activation underlies all actions of the muscarinic receptors, thus accounting for their slow onset. The rapid nature of the synaptic transmission mediated by the nicotinic receptor is consistent with its role at the NMJ and in the ganglion of the ANS."
"Little is known about the role of the nicotinic receptor role in CNS behavior. Clearly, nicotine stimulation is related in some manner to reinforcement, as indicated by the prevalence of nicotine addiction among humans. Muscarinic receptors, in contrast, are important mediators of behavior in the CNS."
"One example is their role in modulating motor control circuits in the basal ganglia. A second example is their participation in learning and memory. The latter is inferred from two types of observations: 1) muscarinic antagonists are amnesic agents, and 2) deterioration of the cholinergic innervation of the neocortex is associated with memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease."
"Alzheimer's disease: A disease in which a marked deterioration occurs in the CNS, the hallmark of which is a progressive dementia. One of the characteristics of this disease is a marked decrease in ACh concentrations in the cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus. Myasthenia gravis: A disease of the neuromuscular junction in which the receptors for ACh are destroyed through the actions of the patient's own antibodies."
"Cholinergic Pharmacology: Numerous drugs are used clinically to interact with the cholinergic systems. Table II summarizes the major uses for cholinergic drugs. Monoamines  include three classes of neurotransmitters: Catecholamines Dopamine , norepinephrine  and epinephrine  make up a class of neurotransmitters named on the basis of the hydroxylated phenol ring termed a catechol nucleus."
"Indolamines Serotonin ; is the principal member of this group of compounds. The name serotonin is derived from the fact that this substance was first isolated from the serum based on its ability to cause an increase in blood pressure. Melatonin, a second indolamine, is restricted to the pineal and is released into the blood stream in a manner that is regulated by the diurnal cycle."
Melatonin will not be covered further in this chapter. Histamine Histamine has been recognized as a neurotransmitter in the CNS only within the past fifteen years. Catecholamines are neurotransmitters in a sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system and in the CNS.
"As shown in Figure 12,2, norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter in postganglionic sympathetic neurons where it acts on smooth muscle to cause either contraction or relaxation, depending on the types of receptors present . DA is a neurotransmitter in autonomic ganglia where it modulates cholinergic transmission and in the kidney, where it produces renal vasodilation and inhibits Na+ and H2O reabsorption. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are neurohumoral agents released into the circulation by the adrenal medulla."
"The ratio of E to NE released is 4 to 1. Generally, the cell bodies of catecholamine neurons are found in clusters in the brain stem or midbrain and project to other regions of the brain and spinal cord. NE, for example, projects to almost every area of the brain."
"In contrast, DA has a more restricted projection. Epinephrine, which will not be covered in this chapter, has the most restricted distribution. The major site of DA cell bodies is the midbrain."
"These clusters of cells give rise to four DA systems shown in Figure 12,3: Mesostriatal DA System - The mesostriatal DA system, referred to as the nigrostriatal pathway, is composed of two components, a dorsal mesostriatal pathway and a ventral mesostriatal pathway. These two pathways are important for movement control and reward mechanisms. The dorsal mesostriatal pathway  originates in the substantia nigra par compacta and ascends to innervate the corpus striatum , where it modulates the output of the corpus striatum."
"The destruction of the nigrostriatal cells in Parkinson's disease produces marked motor deficits. The ventral mesostriatal pathway  also originates in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and innervates the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercles and medial caudate-putamen. The ventral nigrostriatal pathway plays an important role in positive incentive characteristics of rewarding behaviors and the psychostimulants, as will be discussed further in Chapter 12, Part 10."
Mesolimbocortical DA System - The Mesolimbocortical DA system  originates in the midbrain and projects to limbic structures . This DA system is believed to participate in schizophrenia. The current hypothesis is that an increase in DA function in the mesolimbic system and a decreased function in the mesocortical DA systems occur in schizophrenia.
Periventricular DA System - The periventricular DA system  coordinates motivated behavior. These DA cells originate in the periventricular region of hypothalamus and send short axons to several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. Collaterals also descend to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord to synapse with sympathetic preganglionic neurons.
"This dual innervation of hypothalamic and sympathetic preganglionic neurons is believed to integrate the central and autonomic components of motivated behaviors, including behaviors such as sex, thirst and appetite. Tuberohypophyseal DA System - The tuberohypophyseal DA system mediates the control of milk production during lactation. The DA cells  originate in the periventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus and project to the median eminence of the hypothalamus where they release DA into the capillary plexus of the hypophyseal-portal system."
"DA travels to the anterior pituitary where it inhibits the release of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production in lactating animals. The major site of NE cell bodies is the medulla and pons. The NE cells consist of three main groups shown in Figure 12."
"4: locus coeruleus complex , lateral tegmental system , and dorsal medullary system . In all three cases the neurons project diffusely to broad regions of the brain where their nerve terminals lack conventional synaptic junctions. Release of transmitter from these cells is described as volume transmission, because NE, once released, is thought to diffuse and influence a number of adjacent cells."
"Locus Coeruleus System - The locus coeruleus  is considered the most influential of the cell groups even though it consists of less than 2,000 cells on either side of the midline. This importance is because LC axons project rostrally via the dorsal noradrenergic bundle to innervate nearly the entire telencephalon and diencephalon, as well as dorsally to innervate the cerebellum and caudally to innervate the spinal cord. The nerve fibers are so highly ramified in the terminal fields such that each axon may branch as many as 100,000 times."
"This pattern of innervation enables the LC to synchronously modulate cellular activity across wide expanses of the cortex. Lateral Tegmental System - The axons of the lateral tegmental system  project caudally to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord where they inhibit sympathetic preganglionic cells, and ventrally to the hypothalamus. The joint innervation of the hypothalamus and the intermediolateral column cells is believed to be the basis for NE integration of central and peripheral sympathetic autonomic function."
"Dorsal Medullary System - As a complement to the lateral tegmental system, the dorsal medullary system  projects to the nucleus solitarius, as well as to the brain stem nuclei that control cranial parasympathetic function . These NE systems are believed to provide control of the cranial parasympathetic system in a manner analogous to the lateral tegmental system's control of the sympathetic system. Two clusters of epinephrine  cells are located in the medullary reticular formation."
"One cluster of cells in the ventrolateral medulla sends ascending projections to innervate the periaqueductal gray and several hypothalamic and olfactory nuclei. This cluster also sends a descending projection to innervate the sympathetic preganglionic cells of the intermediolateral column in a manner analogous to the NE lateral tegmental system. The second group of cells, located in the dorsomedial medulla near the floor of the fourth ventricle, project to several parasympathetic cranial nerve nuclei ."
"These adrenergic cells are believed to coordinate eating and various visceral functions including the regulation of blood pressure. Caudal System: The caudal cluster of 5-HT cells  is located close to the midline and project caudally to the spinal cord dorsal and ventral horns as well as the intermediolateral cell column. These pathways are believed to mediate the role of 5-HT in sensory, motor and autonomic functions, respectively."
"Rostral System: The rostral midbrain cluster of cells ,  are distributed throughout the midbrain. A cluster of cells located medially and another located dorsally provide over 80% of the 5-HT innervation of the forebrain. These cells project to the diencephalon, basal ganglia, limbic system, cortex, mesencephalic gray and inferior and superior colliculi."
Some evidence supports the conclusion that the innervation of forebrain structures by serotonergic processes is complementary to that of NE. Another important aspect of 5-HT microanatomy is that two distinct patterns of innervation exist for these medial and dorsal systems. The dorsal system is similar in its anatomy to that of catecholamine neurons with thin diffusely branching axons lacking classic synaptic contacts .
"The medial system, in contrast, appears to have classical synapses and is characterized by the presence of thick axons with large round nerve endings that make extensive synaptic contacts. These differences imply a marked difference in the physiological function of these two 5-HT systems. Other Systems: In addition to the above two pathways, another 5-HT pathway projects partially from one of the rostral nuclei  and partially from two caudal nuclei  to innervate the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei."
"There is also a widespread 5-HT projection to structures within the brainstem, including the locus coeruleus, several cranial nuclei, inferior olivary nucleus, and nucleus solitarius. Histamine cells  are located exclusively in the basal posterior hypothalamus. These cells project extensively throughout the neural axis in a manner analogous to the NE and 5-HT systems."
"Although HA has not been investigated extensively, based on its diffuse innervation of the CNS and lack of classic synaptic contacts, it is likely that histamine has a broad behavioral and physiological function. Histamine is also the major active substance released from mast cells. The presence of mast cells in the blood in the CNS has hindered the analysis of the role of histamine as a neurotransmitter."
"The monoamines will be considered as a group in discussing the cell biology of their 1) synthesis, 2) storage and 3) release. Monoamine receptors and termination of action of each monoamine will be considered separately. All monoamine  neurotransmitters are synthesized from amino acids through a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions in which hydroxylation, decarboxylation and/or methylation convert the precursor amino acid into the active monoamine neurotransmitter."
"Biosynthesis of all monoamines occurs primarily in the nerve terminal. As shown in Figure 12. 7, the first step in the synthesis of catecholamines  is the hydroxylation of the tyrosine to form DOPA."
"An analogous reaction, the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5 hydroxytryptophane  is the first step in the biosynthesis of 5-HT. Both tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase are the rate-limiting steps in the biosynthetic pathway of the respective monoamines. Both enzymes are mixed function mono-oxygenases requiring molecular oxygen, iron and the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin  for activity."
"BH4 is converted to BH2 during the hydroxylation and must be regenerated to BH4 in order for monoamine biosynthesis to continue. As shown in Figure 12. 7, the enzyme pteridine reductase regenerates the active cofactor."
"Pteridine reductase is therefore also an essential enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines. The next step in the biosynthesis of monoamines is the decarboxylation by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase  to form the corresponding monoamine . NE is then formed from dopamine through an additional reaction, the hydroxylation of the 2nd carbon of the DA side chain."
This last hydroxylation step occurs within the monoamine storage vesicle  and is catalyzed by dopamine β hydroxylase. Two additional cofactors are required for the synthesis of monoamines; vitamin B6 is necessary as a cofactor for AADC catalyzed decarboxylation. Vitamin C is required as a cofactor for DA conversion to NE in the storage vesicle .
Epinephrine is synthesized in adrenal medulla and CNS by methylation of NE on the amino-terminus . The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is phenyl ethanolamine N methyl transferase . This enzyme uses S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor to methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine .
"PNMT's localization outside the storage vesicle requires that norepinephrine shuttle out of the vesicle to be converted to epinephrine and then back into the storage vesicle for storage and release. As shown in Figure 12,8, in contrast to the catecholamines and 5-HT, the biosynthesis of histamine does not require hydroxylation. Histamine is the product of the decarboxylation of the amino acid, histidine, to form the monoamine, histamine, in a single step that is analogous to the decarboxylation of DOPA and 5-HTP."
"A different enzyme is used to decarboxylate histidine, histidine decarboxylase, as shown in Figure 12,8. This enzyme, like AADC, requires vitamin B6. The concentration of catecholamines in nerve terminals remains relatively constant despite frequent fluctuations in neuronal activity."
This homeostasis is achieved through the regulation of TH activity. TH is phosphorylated and activated by both calcium and cAMP dependent protein kinases. A longer-term regulation of CA synthesis also occurs.
This regulation is mediated through altered transcription of TH mRNA and altered TH mRNA stability. Both mechanisms lead to increased levels of TH protein. The level of serotonin is regulated principally by the amount of tryptophan available to serotonergic neurons.
"This has two important implications for the level of serotonin in the brain. First, because tryptophan is not synthesized in mammals, the level of tryptophan available for serotonin biosynthesis is dependent on diet. Thus, diets high in tryptophan can markedly elevate serotonin levels."
"Second, because tryptophan is transported across the blood brain barrier by a transport system which also transports certain other amino acids, diets high in these amino acids can reduce the level of serotonin in the brain by competing with tryptophan for transport into the CNS. As will be discussed later, altered serotonin level in the CNS can have marked consequences on behavior. Thus far the mechanism for the regulation of histamine biosynthesis is unknown."
"Monoamine neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles that appear dark at the EM level and are thus referred to as dense core vesicles. MA neurotransmitters are stored at a high concentration and are complexed with ATP and several proteins called chromogranins. One of these chromogranins is the enzyme, dopamine β hydroxylase , that converts DA to NE."
"As shown in Figure 12. 9, MA neurotransmitters are taken into the vesicles by an exchange of H+ for the MA. In NE cells DA is taken up and converted to NE by DβH."
"As described above in the synthesis section, DβH hydroxylates the amino side chain. The uptake of MA neurotransmitters into storage vesicles is inhibited by the drug reserpine. Neuronal activation elicits the release of MA neurotransmitters by a calcium-dependent exocytosis, as described in Lecture 10, under Secretory Mechanism."
"The vesicular contents are released from the nerve terminal into the extracellular space during secretion. Because there is no classic postsynaptic specialization associated with the majority of MA nerve endings, the released MA neurotransmitters diffuse to postsynaptic cells in the vicinity where they stimulate MA receptors . MA neurotransmitters also act on the presynaptic cell, as shown in Figure 12."
"10 to influence their cell biology in a feed back manner. The interaction with the presynaptic receptors  can both stimulate MA biosynthesis and inhibit the further release of neurotransmitter. Both the pre- and postsynaptic MA receptors are G protein linked, seven trans-membrane receptors."
"Their structure is similar to the muscarinic receptors discussed in the Lecture 11, Cholinergic Neurotransmission. The vast majority of the MA receptors are seven transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptors  that mediate MA action through one of a few mechanisms. These are the same mechanisms employed by other GPCR, such as the muscarinic receptors  and GPC-glutamate receptors ."
"These mechanisms are: Stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase , Stimulation of PLCβ or PLA , and Direct action on ion channel . As will be described below, one type of MA receptor, 5-HT3, is unusual in that it is NOT LINKED TO G PROTEIN LINKED RECEPTORS. Instead, 5-HT3 receptors are ligand gated ion channels, similar in structure and function to ionotropic nicotinic cholinergic receptors and glutamate receptors."
"The receptors for NE and E were originally classified based on the observation that some physiological actions were mimicked by the catecholamine analog, isoproterenol, whereas others were not. This observation led to the convention that actions that could be mimicked by isoproterenol were classified as mediated by β-receptors. Those actions that were not mimicked by isoproterenol were classified as mediated by α-receptors."
"This classification has since been extended to include subclasses of α and β receptors based on the capacity of drugs to selectively activate  specific physiological responses to NE and E. The molecular cloning of mRNAs for distinct subclasses of NE and E receptors also aided in the classification of receptors. Tables I, II and III summarize autonomic and CNS NE and E receptor types, their location and their physiological action."
"Noteworthy is the fact that most α receptor responses are excitatory, while most β responses are inhibitory . Also, the α receptor is invariably linked to IP3 production, whereas the β receptor is associated with increased levels of cAMP. The distribution of NE receptors in the CNS is complex and not yet well resolved."
"Generally, both α and β receptors are believed to be modulators of the actions of other neurotransmitters. As summarized in Table II, α1 receptors are often excitatory, acting via IP3. In contrast, α2 receptors are inhibitory acting via decreased levels of cAMP."
"β receptors are inhibitory and act through increased levels of cAMP . The anatomical location of the specific receptor subtypes is not yet clearly delineated. In the CNS, dopamine receptors, designated by the letter D, are grouped into two large families based on cDNA-derived structural similarities, synaptic action and signaling mechanism ."
"The D1 family  increases cAMP level, and has a positive influence on the excitability of its target cell. The D2 family  decreases cAMP level and decreases the excitability of the target cell. As shown in Table III the two families of receptors appear to have similar anatomical distributions."
"However, this may be misleading. Future research will probably show that the location of the receptors is on distinct postsynaptic cells or on presynaptic versus postsynaptic sites. All but one of the 5-HT receptors belongs to the G protein coupled receptor superfamily."
"The one exception is the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a ligand gated ion channel. As is apparent from the summary in Table IV, 5-HT mediated actions occur through the same types of second messenger mechanisms as cholinergic and catecholamine G protein linked receptors. Two classes of 5-HT receptors, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D, appear to predominantly act as autoreceptors to modulate the synthesis and release of 5-HT from the presynaptic terminal of serotonergic neurons."
"Other receptor types lead to an increase in the excitability of the target cell , while still others  decrease excitability. Interestingly, receptors that mediate increased excitability do so through at least three mechanisms, PLCβ stimulation, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase or the direct interaction of 5-HT with the ion channel to depolarize the membrane. Three subtypes of histamine receptors have been identified."
"All three are G protein linked and all three are present in the CNS as well as the periphery. Thus far, only peripheral H receptors have been characterized . H1 receptors mediate the well-known physiological responses to histamine that occur in response to histamine liberation from mast cells."
"A large number of prescription and over the counter drugs, antihistamines, act by blocking H1 receptors. Because most H1 blockers also have a sedative effect and cause drowsiness, it appears likely that H1 receptors are also present in the CNS. Recently developed H1 blockers that do not cross that blood brain barrier have circumvented the sedative problem."
The mechanism of action of H1 receptors is the activation of PLCβ. H2 receptors are responsible for the peripheral actions of histamine that are not blocked by H1 antagonists. These receptors are coupled to stimulation of cAMP and are responsible for histamine's stimulation of gastric acid secretion.
"Recently developed specific H2 receptor blockers, Tagamet and Zantac, are effective clinically for excess secretion of gastric acid. Because these drugs do not cross the blood brain barrier, they have no effects on the CNS. H3 histamine receptors are found on histamine nerve terminals where they regulate the release of histamine."
"There is evidence for these receptors on the terminals of other neurotransmitter types as well, indicating that histamine may regulate the synthesis and secretion of other neurotransmitters. When presynaptic receptors are located on cells other than their own neurotransmitter type they are called heteroreceptors. The major mechanism for the inactivation of secreted MA is the reuptake into the nerve terminal from which the MA was released."
"Under conditions of very high neuronal activity, the MA will also be taken up by neighboring glial cells and will overflow into the capillaries perfusing the CNS. Under all three situations, a portion of the MA will be metabolized by enzymes that inactivate the MA, converting them to inactive products. As described below, measurement of these metabolites is used clinically and in research to monitor the activity of the MA systems."
"High affinity transport  into axon terminals is the main process of inactivation of released monoamines. Reuptake requires sodium ions and a source of energy  and is mediated by a protein carrier located on the plasma membrane of the monamine neurons. Tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine inhibit the transporters for DA, NE and 5-HT."
Within the past ten years the structure of several MA transporters has been determined and shown to consist of a twelve transmembrane protein with both the N and C terminal ends residing within the cytoplasm . The powerful addictive drugs cocaine and amphetamine increase the level of MA neurotransmitters in the extracellular space. Cocaine acts by blocking the transport of MA  neurotransmitters into the terminal and as a consequence increases MA in the extracellular space.
"In contrast, amphetamine reverses the transport direction , transporting MA neurotransmitters out of the nerve terminal. A low affinity uptake of monoamines into surrounding glial cells also inactivates released monoamines. Because this process acts only at very high concentrations of monoamines, it is believed to only come into play when the concentration of released neurotransmitter is very high."
"A portion of released catecholamines diffuse to the extracellular space where monoamine oxidase  and/or catechol-0-methyl-transferase  eventually catabolize it. This route of inactivation is more prominent following extremely high levels of catecholaminergic neuronal activity. Catecholamines and 5-HT: The enzymatic metabolism of MA neurotransmitters is carried out by MAO, COMT and histamine methyl transferase."
"These enzymes are widely distributed in tissues. Monoamine Oxidase : This metabolic enzyme is located on the outer membrane of the mitochondrion and metabolizes DA, NE and 5-HT by oxidative deamination of  to the corresponding aldehyde . DHPA and PHPGA are aldehyde intermediates that must be further metabolized by aldehyde reductase or dehydrogenase to alcohols and acids, respectively."
"These metabolites are excreted , or further metabolized by methylation through the action of catechol-O-methyltransferase and then excreted . Pargyline, an irreversible inhibitor of MAO, blocks monoamine degradation. Catechol-O-methyl-transferase : This extraneuronal enzyme inactivates catecholamines by methylation of the hydroxyls on the catechol ring."
"COMT methylates either catecholamines that have already been metabolized by MAO or those that have not. The metabolites of catecholamines are shown in Table VI. Measurement of MA metabolites in CSF, blood or urine provides a useful clinical index of the rate of release or turnover of MA neurotransmitters."
"Metabolites of catecholamines and serotonin are assayed in the CSF to obtain an index of brain metabolites. This method has been only modestly useful in determining the role of a specific MA neurotransmitters in brain disorders. Likewise, specific catecholamine metabolites in urine or the blood provide an index of peripheral sympathetic neurons and adrenal medullary catecholamines."
"The metabolites that are routinely measured clinically to assess CNS and peripheral catecholamine function are summarized in Table VI. Two CSF metabolites provide a measure of central DA function: 1) HVA, a methylated DA metabolite , and 2) DOPAC, an un-methylated metabolite, . The CSF metabolite that is measured to assess central NE function is MHPG, a methylated NE metabolite ."
"The metabolite that provides the best index of autonomic nervous system activity is VMA, a methylated NE metabolite . Metanephrine levels are monitored to assess the relative activity of the adrenal medulla or a tumor of this tissue, phaeochromocytoma. 5-HIAA reflects the activity of 5-HT cells."
"Histamine: The metabolism of HA is somewhat different than the other MA. HA is taken up into cells where it is first methylated by histamine methyltransferase  to form telemethylhistamine. MAO subsequently oxidizes telemethylhistamine to the histamine metabolite, telemethylimadazole ."
"DA is involved in a number of important physiological functions including motor control, coordinating autonomic function, and regulating hormone release and motivation. The role of DA systems in motivated behavior is of particular importance. DA appears to be involved in at least two phases of motivated behavior: an appetite phase and a consumption phase."
"The ventral striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens, has been shown to be actively involved in appetitive aspects of motivation. For example, food deprived animals with lesions of the nucleus accumbens fail to show an appetitive behavior when presented with food. The consumption of the food, in contrast, is unimpaired by these lesions."
"On the other hand, the dorsal striatum, particularly the caudate-putamen, appears to be involved in consummatory aspects of motivated behavior. Lesions in this region disrupt motivated behavior. Animals with lesions in this region will approach food but will not consume it."
"These and other observations have led to the proposition that DA mediates a performance activating effect of motivated behavior, as well as conveying internal reward signals. These characteristics of DA neurotransmission make it an extremely important neurotransmitter in motivational behavior as well as in the neuropharmacology of reward. Importantly, DA neurotransmission is hypothesized to be at the heart of the mechanisms of ALL addictive-drugs and behaviors."
"A pertinent example of DA's role is illustrated by both cocaine and amphetamine, two abused drugs that act by increasing the concentration of DA in the synaptic space. NE, like DA, is involved in a broad range of physiological functions and behaviors. One of the most important is its role in attention and arousal."
NE neurons appear to be involved in the regulation of an organism's vigilance. The broad projection of the locus coeruleus  makes it especially well suited to act as a mechanism to alert cortical and thalamic areas to incoming sensory stimuli. The LC is electrophysiologically quiet during low vigilance states such as sleep or in the lack of sensory input.
"When exposed to a strong stimulus, the LC markedly increases its firing rate, however. The broad influence of the activated LC is to filter weak stimuli and enhance moderate stimuli. This filtering and enhancement by NE is believed to aid in CNS processing of sensory information."
"In support of this conclusion, the application of NE to cortical neurons reduces responsiveness to weak stimuli, and enhances responses to strong stimuli. α2 receptors appear to be important for these responses. Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in a number of physiological regulatory mechanisms and behaviors, including appetite, sleep, and aggression."
"Serotonin is important in the regulation of appetite, and appears to act in a pathway that monitors the carbohydrate intake, acting as a negative regulator of the motivation to ingest carbohydrate. This response appears to be mediated by 5-HT in the hypothalamus and has led to the use of serotonin uptake blockers, such as fenfluramine, as obesity pills . Many clinical observations and animal behavioral studies support the conclusion that serotonin is an important factor in aggressive behavior and the expression of dominance versus submissive behavior."
"For example the use of pharmacological agents to decrease levels of 5-HT at synapses in animal studies consistently demonstrates that low 5-HT is associated with both increased aggressiveness and decreased dominance. Similarly, the measurement of 5-HT metabolites in CSF and blood of patients or experimental animals shows that low 5-HIAA predicts aggressiveness as well as risk taking and a lower social rank. This correlation between decreased 5-HT activity and increased aggression was recently supported by the observation that 5-HT1B receptor knock-out mice have a marked increase in aggressive behavior."
MA neurotransmitters are prominent participants in the etiology of many PNS and CNS disorders. Described below are several of the more prominent examples. Some of the many neuropharmacological agents that are used to treat these disorders are contained in Table VII.

Schizophrenia. The DA theory of schizophrenia is based on the observation that DA antagonists are effective antipsychotic drugs. Their capacity to inhibit DA receptors correlates well with their antipsychotic efficacy.
"Currently, clinical studies are attempting to develop DA antagonists with specific DA receptor subtype efficacy that will most effectively decrease the antipsychotic symptoms without influencing other DA actions, such as movement control. As mentioned in the anatomy section, an overactivity of the mesolimbic DA system appears especially prominent in schizophrenia. Disorders of Movement Control."
"It is now well accepted that decreased DA in the substantia nigra and striatum is the critical lesion in Parkinson's disease. Autopsy shows that nearly all DA is lost during the course of this disease, apparently due to the degeneration of DA neurons. l-DOPA is used to treat this disease's symptoms because it can be converted to DA by AADC in the cells in the vicinity of the degenerated nerve endings to replace the missing endogenous DA."
"Some preparations of l-DOPA include a pherpheral AADC inhibitor so that more of the l-DOPA will be available for transport into the CNS. Conversion of l-DOPA into DA in the blood prevents its transport into the CNS. Other drugs that are effective in treating Parkinson's symptoms are DA agonists, as well as MAO and COMT inhibitors."
"Affective Disorders. NE is believed to be involved in the etiology of some unipolar and bipolar affective disorders. This conclusion is based to a large degree on the observation that drugs that are effective in treating depression are also good at either 1) preventing the metabolism of NE , or 2) preventing the the removal of NE from the extracellular space by uptake into nerve endings."
"There is also evidence that the levels of the CNS NE metabolites are lower in depressed patients and higher during the manic phase of bipolar disorder in manic patients. Autonomic or Smooth Muscle Dysfunction. Drugs that interact with NE receptors are widely used to treat disorders involving autonomic or smooth muscle dysfunction such as asthma, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmias, migraine and hyperthyroidism."
. Affective Disorders. Low levels of 5-HT and metabolites are associated with depression and especially a type of depression that is more likely to lead to suicide.
"Several studies have shown reduced 5-HT in brains of suicide victims as well as a low 5HIAA in CSF of depressed patients who have high incidence of suicide attempts. Recent studies indicate that this type of 5-HT influence may start early in life; low levels of 5HIAA have been found in children and adolescents with disruptive behavioral disorders. Some of the drugs that are effective antidepressant treatments are nonspecific with respect to their relative influence on NE versus 5-HT disposition, thus it has been difficult to know for certain which monoamine is responsible for the treatment effects."
More recently selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  have been introduced for the treatment of depression that are among the more effective drugs available for this purpose. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 5-HT dysfunction has been associated with obsessive compulsive disorder.
"Accordingly, selective 5-HT uptake blockers are used as a therapy for this condition. Aggression. Although controversial, 5-HT reuptake blockers are used for the treatment of aggression."
Eating Disorders. Also controversial is the use of the drug fenfluramine to treat eating disorders because of the toxic effects that occur in some individuals. Fenfluramine blocks 5-HT reuptake into nerve terminals.
Schizophrenia. A number of recently introduced antipsychotic drugs are producing favorable results in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. These drugs are interesting pharmacologically in that they block both DA and 5-HT receptors as well as ACh and HA .
Migraine Headaches. 5-HT1 agonists are used for the treatment of migraine headache. Insomnia.
The role of 5-HT in sleep regulation has lead to the hypothesis that reduced levels 5-HT may induce insomnia. Some clinicians are treating patients with 5-HT uptake blockers for this ailment. Insomnia.
The most popular treatment for insomnia is the use of over the counter CNS acting antihistamines. Amino acid transmitters provide the majority of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system. The sensory-to-motor neuron connection in the spinal cord that controls the knee-jerk reflex is an excellent starting point for illustration.
Figure 13. 1 shows a monosynaptic connection in the spinal cord between the sensory neuron  and the motor neuron innervating the extensor muscle . A single action potential evoked in the sensory neuron produces an excitatory postsynaptic potential  in the extensor motor neuron  of about 1 mV.
The same sensory neuron also makes a synaptic connection with an interneuron  in the spinal cord that then synapses on the motor neuron  innervating the flexor muscle. An action potential elicited in the interneuron produces an inhibitory postsynaptic potential  in the flexor motor neuron. Recall that many EPSPs are needed to drive the motor neuron's resting potential to the threshold to generate an action potential.
These are the processes of temporal and spatial summation. The neurotransmitters and the receptors that mediate these and other excitatory and inhibitory responses are the focus of this section. Excitatory transmission  is mediated largely by the acidic amino acid glutamate.
"Inhibitory neurotransmission  is mediated primarily by glycine in the spinal cord, and a metabolite of glutamate called gamma-aminobutyric acid  in the brain. Neurons receive many thousands of synaptic inputs some excitatory, some inhibitory, and some modulatory. Excitatory synaptic connections are typically found on the major receiving area of the neuron, the dendrite, and most often on spines that project from the dendrite ."
"These excitatory synapses have identifiable morphological characteristics and are referred to as Type I . A distinct zone frequently exists in the pre-synaptic terminal of Type I synapses responsible for the release of vesicles containing glutamate and a corresponding zone under the postsynaptic membrane that serves to anchor the receptors for glutamate . In addition, vesicles that contain glutamate are small  and tend to have a spherical appearance."
"Inhibitory synapses  tend to be localized near the neuronal soma and are referred to as Type II . Morphologically, the synapses again have specializations for release of vesicles and for anchoring receptors. However, the zones of contact tend to be smaller than for excitatory synapses ."
"For unknown reasons, the vesicles containing glycine or GABA are often elliptical in shape. Functionally, the location of these synaptic contacts has profound influences on the postsynaptic neuron. In general, the further from the cell body, the more the EPSP is attenuated by the passive properties of the membrane ."
"Therefore, for neurons lacking regenerative processes in their dendrites, EPSPs that are far from the point of action potential generation  attenuate to a greater degree than IPSPs which are generated closer to the neuron's soma. Due to this spatial arrangement and the relatively small size of each EPSP , many distant EPSPs must summate to cause the initiation of an action potential. In contrast, fewer local IPSPs on the cell soma are required to inhibit production of action potentials."
"On a typical cortical neuron, one might find 10,000 axodendritic excitatory synapses and only 10-50 axosomatic inhibitory synapses. Initially, amino acids were not considered viable candidates for neurotransmitters since they are ubiquitous cellular constituents and are required for protein synthesis. Also, unlike the specific enzymes in neurons that synthesize ACh and catecholamines, enzymes that synthesize glutamate, aspartate and glycine are not unique to neurons."
"Whereas antibodies to choline acetyltransferase can be used to identify neurons as cholinergic, no such markers are available for neurons that use the amino acids as transmitters. Nevertheless, it is now known that amino acids constitute the major group of substances used for generating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials in the CNS. Amino acids used for synaptic transmission are compartmentalized."
"For example, glutamate to be used as a neurotransmitter is compartmentalized from metabolic glutamate used for protein synthesis by packaging the transmitter into synaptic vesicles for subsequent Ca2+-dependent release. Amino acid neurotransmitters are all products of intermediary metabolism with the exception of GABA. Unlike all the other amino acid neurotransmitters, GABA is not used in protein synthesis and is produced by an enzyme  uniquely located in neurons."
"Antibodies to GAD can be used to identify neurons that release GABA. Glutamate and aspartate are products of the Kreb's cycle, and both have excitatory effects in the CNS. They are produced in the mitochondria, transported into the cytoplasm, and packaged into synaptic vesicles ."
Specific high-affinity enzymes are responsible for packaging glutamate into vesicles. The actions of glutamate are terminated by high-affinity uptake systems in neurons and glia . Under normal circumstances most uptake is back into the neuron and this glutamate can immediately be pumped into vesicles for subsequent release.
"When neuronal activity is high, extracellular glutamate concentration exceeds the capacity of neuronal uptake. At this point, uptake systems in glial cells help absorb the excess glutamate. However, glutamate is not permeable to the plasma membrane."
"To recycle the glutamate taken up into glial cells, an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by glutamine synthase produces glutamine from glutamate . Glutamine is freely permeable to the glial and neuronal plasma membranes and diffuses back into the neuron. The neuronal enzyme glutaminase then metabolizes glutamine into glutamate where it can then be packaged into synaptic vesicles for another round of release ."
Glycine is the main neurotransmitter that mediates the inhibitory actions of spinal cord interneurons. It is also present in lower amounts throughout the nervous system. Glycine is synthesized from serine in the mitochondria .
"The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme serine transhydroxymethylase . Like glutamate, high-affinity uptake systems remove glycine from the synaptic cleft, which can then be repackaged into vesicles. The binding of glycine to its receptor on postsynaptic neurons is blocked by the poison strychnine, thus blocking glycine's inhibitory actions ."
The block of inhibition leads to hyperexcitation and typically a patient with strychnine poisoning asphyxiates due to an inability to relax the diaphragm. More details on the nature of glycine receptors are provided later in this chapter. GABA mediates the majority of inhibitory synaptic actions in the CNS.
"GABA is synthesized from glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by glutamic acid decarboxylase . Antibodies to GAD can be used to identify GABAergic neurons. Like the other amino acid transmitters, GABA's actions are terminated by high affinity uptake systems in neurons and glia."
"Neuronal uptake permits immediate repackaging into vesicles for release. Compared with glutamate, a more elaborate set of reactions is necessary to return GABA to the neuron when it is taken up by glial cells. Some of these enzymes are shared with those for returning released glutamate to neurons described in Figure 13."
"4. GABA is first converted back into glutamate by the mitochondrial enzyme GABA transaminase  using the -COOH group from alpha-ketoglutarate. This pathway is sometimes referred to as the ""GABA shunt""."
"The glutamate is then converted to glutamine by the enzyme glutamine synthase and glutamine diffuses back into the neuron. Finally, glutaminase converts glutamine into glutamate, which can again serve as a substrate for GAD, completing the cycle. All of these amino acid neurotransmitters are released by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis at presynaptic specializations as discussed in Chapter 8, Part 7 and Chapter 10, Part 4."
"All vesicles  also contain ATP that is co-released when these vesicles fuse with the membrane. ATP and its degradation product adenosine are themselves neurotransmitter molecules  that can also modify the pre- or postsynaptic cell's response if the appropriate receptors are present. For example, adenosine is a potent inhibitor of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals."
"Receptors for each of the amino acid neurotransmitters can either directly open an ion channel  or couple to a G-protein  except for glycine. There is no known GPCR for glycine and all of glycine's effects are mediated through an ion channel permeable to Cl-. In contrast, glutamate and GABA can produce fast responses by directly opening ion channels and can produce slow responses by activating receptors coupled to G-proteins."
"Examples of ionotropic receptors and GPCRs are compared in Figures 13. 7 and 13. 8, respectively."
"There are at least three distinct types of glutamate receptors. Two are ionotropic since glutamate binding directly opens an ion channel and the other is a GPCR, producing alterations in intracellular messengers . These three distinct types of glutamate receptors have been characterized by using agonists that specifically activate each type."
"The agonists and the subset of glutamate receptors they activate are termed: NMDA , non-NMDA , and G-protein coupled glutamate receptor. Ionotropic glutamate receptors open channels that cause the cell to depolarize and are therefore excitatory . The reversal potential  of the EPSP indicates that glutamate opens receptors selectively permeable to cations ."
"Opening of non-NMDA receptors causes the majority of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials  in the nervous system. This receptor is mainly permeable to Na+ and K+ . The structure of non-NMDA receptors loosely resembles the nicotinic ACh receptor, although glutamate receptors have some unique features."
"Four subunits, each having only three membrane spanning segments , combine to produce the functional receptor. Many different subunit isoforms have been cloned and characterized and mixing different subunits can significantly alter the properties of the mature non-NMDA receptor. As one example, some subunit mixtures are permeable to Ca2+ as well as Na+ and K+."
"Although it is premature to dwell on these details, future development of drugs that bind to specific glutamate receptor subtypes will find important clinical applications. NMDA receptors are unique in the nervous system and exhibit two important characteristics. First, they have a high permeability to Ca2+ , and when they open significant increases in the level of Ca2+ can be detected in the neuron ."
"Increased levels of Ca2+ activate a wide variety of enzyme systems that alter both the short- and long-term response of the neurons . Glycine, which is normally always present in the extracellular space, is also required for the NMDA receptor to open. Second, NMDA receptors require both ligand binding and membrane depolarization to open."
"The channel associated with the NMDA receptor binds Mg2+, stopping ions from flowing through the channel . Mg2+ can be displaced from the channel by depolarizing the membrane. This unique property imparts to the receptor the capacity to sense the membrane potential and open only when the neuron is depolarized."
"The ability to sense presynaptic activity  and postsynaptic activity  means the NMDA receptor associates the two activities. This property  fulfills one of the central criteria for a molecule involved in learning. Apparently, Ca2+-influx through the NMDA receptor initiates a set of biochemical changes so that the neuron remembers the conjoint activity and responds differently when activated in the future."
"Like the non-NMDA receptor, the mature NMDA receptor is constructed from a mixture of different subunits, again each having three transmembrane segments. GABA and glycine ionotropic receptors are selectively permeable to Cl- . When they open, they cause the neuron to hyperpolarize and therefore drive the membrane potential away from the threshold for firing an action potential."
"GABA, like glutamate, also binds to and activates a GPCR. In contrast, glycine only binds to ionotropic receptors. The GABAA receptor is composed of five subunits that each contain four membrane spanning domains."
"GABAA subunits are highly related to those of the nicotinic ACh receptor. Important differences exist to produce a channel that permits the permeation of the negatively charged Cl- ion. Specifically, there are positively charged amino acids placed at strategic positions within the channel portion of the receptors that permit Cl- passage."
The different subunits of the GABAA receptor are responsible for the binding of different drugs. GABA binds predominantly to the alpha subunit . Benzodiazepines  bind to the gamma subunit.
Barbiturates  bind to both the alpha and beta subunits. Picrotoxin blocks ion flow through the receptor . The pharmacology of GABAA receptors is complex and clinically important.
"When GABA is released into the synapse, it binds to a population of the available receptors, but typically not all of them . If benzodiazepines are present, the effectiveness of GABA binding to its receptor is increased significantly . Therefore, effective doses of benzodiazepines enhance the ability of GABA to hyperpolarize the neuron by increasing the number of GABA receptors that open at a fixed concentration of GABA."
Inhibition is produced by increasing the amount of Cl- that flows into the neuron . Recognize that benzodiazepines themselves do not open the receptor but simply enhance GABA binding. Barbiturates also produce their sedative effects by increasing the effectiveness of GABA binding to its receptor.
"The naturally occurring toxin called picrotoxin is a potent inhibitor of the GABAA receptor and works by preventing Cl- flow through the receptor . The glycine receptor, like the GABAA receptor also permits the influx of Cl- into neurons and displays a reversal potential near -70 mV. This Cl--permeable glycine receptor can be blocked by the rat poison strychnine."
"The mature glycine receptor is constructed from mixtures of at least two subunits each of which has four membrane spanning domains. Glutamate GPCRs are members of a large family of receptors that couple with G proteins to produce their effects. These receptors like those for serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, muscarinic ACh, and dopamine, produce the large majority of their effects through alterations in the activity of metabolic enzymes and not by directly opening ion channels in the membranes."
All of these receptors are single polypeptides that span the membrane seven times . The glutamate GPCR's best known effects are the activation of phospholipase C which generates inositol-trisphosphate  and diacylglycerol  from the precursor lipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate . Inositol-trisphosphate binds to receptors on intracellular organelles causing the release of Ca2+.
"Among several other things, increased Ca2+ along with diacylglycerol lead to the activation of protein kinase C which produces a variety of alterations in the enzymatic machinery of the cell including the regulation of ion channels that affect the electrical properties of the neuron. The GABAB receptor, like the glutamate GPCR, produces its effects not by directly opening ion channels, but by coupling to G-proteins and enzymes that influence metabolites within the neuron. Reported effects include alterations  in cAMP levels, increases in K+-conductance, and decreases in Ca2+-conductance."
"Some of the ion channel effects detected are due to the components of the activated G-protein binding directly to ion channels, influencing their properties . Two basic mechanisms, diffusion and high affinity uptake, terminate the response to amino acid transmitters. The high affinity uptake mechanism is the most predominant."
"The proteins involved in transmitter uptake are related and each contains 12 membrane-spanning domains. Transporters use energy derived either from the hydrolysis of ATP or electrochemical ion gradients established across the membrane to pump the transmitters into neurons and glia. The energy-dependent nature of these receptors means that in times of metabolic stress, such as during an ischemic episode, the pumps fail and toxic levels of these transmitters build up."
The neurotransmitter glutamate is highly toxic to neurons when present for extended periods. One of the best understood clinical conditions involving glutamate is neuronal injury following stroke or trauma. Both events produce massive release of glutamate in the brain that over-stimulates glutamate receptors.
"The absence of energy prevents the pumps from removing glutamate from the synapse. As a consequence, the uncontrolled opening of glutamate receptors causes a large influx of Na+ followed by water that produces swelling and a large and sustained influx of Ca2+ that leads to hyperactivation of many calcium-dependent enzymes. The Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor appears to be one of the keys to producing neuronal damage since specifically blocking activation of this receptor attenuates some of the neuronal injury following stroke."
"The key to minimizing damage following stroke is well-controlled reestablishment of blood flow so that ATP production is supported and homeostasis is reestablished. Clot breaking agents such as tissue plasminogen activator  are now used commonly to reestablish blood flow. Because glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the human brain, derangements in glutamate metabolism or receptor activation have been implicated in a wide variety of pathologic conditions."
These include diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's chorea. One explanation for the establishment of focal epilepsy is decreased local GABA-mediated inhibition. Many facets of epilepsy can be elicited experimentally by blocking GABA receptors with the toxin picrotoxin previously described.
"The decrease in GABA inhibition permits cells to fire synchronously, thus producing massive local excitation and initiation of a seizure. Clinically, seizures can often be terminated by inducing a barbiturate coma. High dose barbiturates presumably potentiate GABA's inhibitory effects, preventing local hyperexcitation by hyperpolarizing the cell membranes."
"Mood disorders  can also be controlled by drugs which potentiate GABA's inhibitory activity. Some of the most widely prescribed drugs-benzodiazepines -produce their pharmacological effects by increasing GABA's ability to hyperpolarize neuronal membranes, thereby quieting the system. This finding suggests that some initial imbalance in the GABAergic system may underlie aspects of this disorder."
"Classical neurotransmitters  work by the directional transfer of information between presynaptic release sites and postsynaptic clusters of receptors. The process is generally well organized spatially with some, but very limited, ""spill-over"" of transmitter between neighboring synapses. The situation is quite different for transmission mediated by neuropeptides and nitric oxide ."
"These molecules ignore directionality of information flow and instead influence a volume of area from their point of release. This feature is loosely analogous to the release of peptide hormones into the blood stream, which can be carried to distant sites to produce their effects. For example, NO can be produced in a postsynaptic neuron and diffuse back to the presynaptic neuron or to other neighboring neurons affecting the subsequent release of transmitter."
"This property is termed retrograde transmission, since the signal travels in the opposite direction  as compared to the classical directionality of neurotransmission. Many neuropeptides were originally described as hormones , although once characterized they were subsequently also found in neurons within the CNS. Neuropeptides typically produce neuronal responses with slow onset and long duration , and every characterized neuropeptide receptor falls into the GPCR  class."
"For comparison, Figure 14. 1 shows typical responses produced by the action of a classical neurotransmitter  acting at an ionotropic receptor and a neuropeptide. An action potential elicited in neuron 1 , a glutamate releasing neuron, produces the fast  EPSP typical of glutamate mediated synaptic transmission."
"In contrast, an action potential elicited in neuron 2  that releases neuropeptide produces a slow onset  and long-duration  EPSP. These slow EPSPs are typical of neuropeptide actions since all neuropeptide receptors are G-protein coupled. In addition, many neuropeptides do not produce an obvious electrophysiological change in the postsynaptic neuron."
"For example, an action potential in neuron 3  produces no response in the postsynaptic neuron even though one can confirm through other means that neuropeptides were released. However, changes have occurred in the postsynaptic neuron as revealed in the example shown in the panels labeled ""C"". If one first measures the glutamate response  by stimulating neuron 1, a typical response is seen."
"Stimulation of neuron 3 produces no response  as before. However, if neuron 1 is stimulated again after the stimulation of neuron 3, the EPSP measured in the postsynaptic neuron is enhanced  . Thus, the neuropeptide released from neuron 3 altered the postsynaptic neuron's response to another neurotransmitter."
"These neuropeptides are said to be neuromodulators since their effects are to potentiate or depress the effects of a second transmitter. Other examples of such heterosynaptic plasticity are described in Chapter 7, Part 2. Neuropeptides can be grouped into families based on similarities in their amino acid sequences ."
"For example, opiates are grouped as a family due to the identical amino acid sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-- found at the N-terminus of each. Neuropeptides are derived from larger precursors by proteolytic processing. They are all initially synthesized within the soma ."
"Precursors are initially formed by translation on polyribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum near the cell body. From there, they progress through the Golgi apparatus where further modifications take place, including glycosylation. They are then packaged into secretory granules that are transported to terminals by fast axonal transport."
"Fast is a relative term, however, and due to the relatively long distances that some neuropeptides must travel. Replenishing the pool of releasable neuropeptide might require many hours. During the transport to the nerve terminal, proteases that are packaged within the vesicle begin to cleave the precursor neuropeptide into its final mature form."
"This processing is essential for the activation of the neuropeptides since the precursors are biologically inactive. At least three types of processing occurs within the vesicles . First, an endopeptidase cleaves the precursor to generate two new products ."
"For many precursors this cleavage occurs after basic residues  and is accomplished by trypsin-like proteases. Next, although not for every neuropeptide, a carboxypeptidase cleaves the basic residues from the C-terminus of the new peptide . Finally, a third enzyme converts the COOH  group of a Gly residue, found at the C-terminus of many neuropeptides, to an NH2  group to produce the mature, active form of the neuropeptide."
Most proteins are produced from mRNA molecules that are spliced from precursor RNAs into their final forms in the nucleus. Differential splicing is one way that a neuron uses to diversify the production of different types of neuropeptides. One well-known example is the substance P mRNA that normally also includes mRNA encoding substance K.
"The substance K portion of the mRNA can be differentially spliced out so that the resulting mRNA can produce only substance P  Neuropeptides are produced from a longer precursor protein by proteolytic processing. An excellent example is the opioid family of peptides . As noted, the proteolytic processing takes place within the transport vesicles and most often occurs by cleaving the precursor on the N-terminal side of basic residues , although other cleavage sites have also been identified."
"In some instances, such as the Enkephalin precursor protein, multiple copies of the same final bioactive peptide are present. The one precursor molecule shown at the top of Figure 14. 3 contains six copies of Met-enkephalin  and one copy of Leu-enkephalin ."
"Diversity can thus be generated by altering the sequence of the cleavage sites by differential splicing, by producing and/or packaging different proteases  into the transport vesicles, or by hiding a proteolytic site by post-translational modifications. An example of the latter is that a specific cleavage site might be hidden by the addition of a carbohydrate side chain that sterically blocks the protease from having access to that site. Another common finding is that a single precursor molecule will contain several different neuropeptides  and therefore the types of processing that occur ultimately determines which neuropeptide is released by the neuron."
"The POMC precursor protein can be cleaved to form ACTH  and β-lipoprotein  that each can be further cleaved to generate additional bioactive neuropeptides . For example, the β-lipoprotein  can be further cleaved into both γ-lipoprotein  and β-endorphin . Again, depending on the processing that takes place, the same precursor protein can be modified to produce neuropeptides with dramatically different biological responses."
"Peptides are released by calcium-dependent exocytosis with some important differences from the release of classical neurotransmitters. Typically, vesicles releasing neuropeptides are much larger than those that contain small molecule neurotransmitters  and do not require a presynaptic specialization for release . In contrast to the small vesicles that contain glutamate, the large vesicles do not appear docked at the membrane."
"This observation is consistent with the idea that small molecule neurotransmitters produce brief, local effects , whereas neuropeptides produce slow, long-lasting effects often encompassing a significant area surrounding the site of release. Also, recall that since neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell soma and not locally at the synapse, if their supply is exhausted from sustained release it might take several hours to replenish the releasable pools. For example, a motor neuron, with its cell body in the spinal cord and the synapse in the foot, has an axon as long as one meter."
"Utilizing fast axonal transport it would potentially take more than a day for a newly synthesized neuropeptide to arrive at this synapse from the soma. It should also be evident that endogenous pain-killing neuropeptides, like beta-endorphin, could be ""used-up"" in times of persistent stimulation leading to situations where pain can no longer be controlled by endogenous mechanisms. A typical mature neuron will often release one small molecule neurotransmitter and one or more neuropeptides ."
"If more than one neuropeptide is released they most often come from the same single precursor molecule. An example is the co-release of both ACh and calcitonin gene-related peptide from spinal motor neurons. CGRP activates adenylate cyclase, raising cAMP levels, and potentiates the force of contraction produced by ACh activation of the nicotinic ACh receptor."
"In this case, the neuropeptide is modulatory as described in Figure 14. 1. However, in this instance, the effect potentiates muscle contraction instead of increasing the magnitude of the EPSP."
"In both examples, the potentiated response is due to increased sensitivity of the system to a constant amount of released neurotransmitter. Neuropeptides are slowly removed from the extracellular space; a feature which also contributes to their relatively long lasting effects. Inactivation occurs by both diffusion and breakdown by extracellular proteases."
No evidence has been found for peptide re-uptake as a means of terminating their action. All known neuropeptide receptors produce their effects by altering the levels of intracellular second messengers. These receptors are seven transmembrane spanning proteins that are linked through G proteins  to alter the activation of other cellular enzymes.
"This property is consistent with neuropeptides inducing a slower response and is well suited for a modulatory role. One important distinction between small and neuropeptide molecule transmitters is that neuropeptide receptors have a high affinity for binding  as opposed to micro- or millimolar affinities measured for small molecule neurotransmitters . As neuropeptides are not released directionally into the confined volume of a synapse, their concentrations do not achieve very high levels and the receptors then must have high affinities to react to these small concentrations."
This high affinity slows the dissociation of the neuropeptide from its receptor and also contributes to the persistent effects of these molecules. Nitric oxide has gained widespread attention as the founding member of a new class of gaseous messenger molecules. NO is the active molecule that sublingual nitroglycerin produces to increase vasodilation in the relief of angina.
"Other important biological effects of NO are now recognized. For example, in the nervous system, NO is important in the regulation of cerebral blood flow, in the modulation of neurotransmission, and in toxicity associated with various pathologic states. NO is a short-lived gas not to be confused with the relatively stable anesthetic gas nitrous oxide ."
NO is actually a free radical and is therefore a highly reactive compound. Some of its toxic effects are likely due to NO reacting with superoxide to produce the destructive radical peroxynitrate. NO is considered an unconventional neurotransmitter because it is not released by exocytosis and its action does not occur through conventional receptor molecules.
"As mentioned previously, the typical description of neuronal communication considers transmission to be unidirectional. A presynaptic neurotransmitter is released that produces changes in the postsynaptic neuron. Several compounds  produced in postsynaptic neurons diffuse into the local environment and affect the surrounding cells."
"Since NO is a freely diffusible gas it has the potential to travel quickly in any direction from its point of production. For example, if produced in a postsynaptic cell because of glutamate receptor stimulation, NO could be released into the local environment and send a signal back to the presynaptic neuron . This type of activity is referred to as retrograde signaling since the signal travels in a retrograde direction from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic neuron."
NO is produced by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase . This enzyme is found in a subpopulation of neurons  and is found in most all endothelial cells. At least one form of NOS in these cells is dependent on calcium and calmodulin for activation as indicated in Figures 14.
"5, 14. 6, and 14. 7."
It also contains cofactors similar to cytochrome P-450. These cofactors are NADPH  and FMN . These cofactors are essential for the transfer of electrons that produces the unstable and short-lived product NO.
"The substrate in this reaction is the common amino acid arginine and the products are citrulline and NO . Because of NO's short lifetime it is extraordinarily difficult to measure directly. However, in experimental preparations, there is an excellent correlation between the application of NMDA, which increases intraneuronal Ca2+ and activates NOS, with the production of the additional product of NOS's enzymatic activity, citrulline ."
"Citrulline production is a reliable indicator of NO production. It is also possible to block the production of citrulline  by feeding cells the non-metabolizable substrate for NOS termed methyl arginine , and such compounds have been used to reduce the production of NO and terminate its biological effects. One of the main targets for NO appears to be the enzyme guanylyl cyclase."
"This discovery was made indirectly by monitoring the accumulation of the NOS product citrulline while also monitoring for the production of cGMP, the product of the enzyme guanylyl cyclase . In this experiment NMDA was added to a neuronal preparation to activate NOS. NOS utilizes arginine as a substrate to produce NO and as mentioned, if a non-hydrolyzable analog like methyl-arginine is added to the system, citrulline and cGMP accumulation were found to terminate in the same dose-dependent fashion."
"These strong correlations led to the discovery that guanylyl cyclase is a main NO target. Guanylyl cyclase is an unusual enzyme because it has a heme ring with an associated iron molecule as part of its structure. NO activates this enzyme by binding to iron in the heme, initiating production of cyclic GMP from GTP  through conformational changes in the enzyme."
cGMP then activates a cGMP-dependent protein kinase and other enzymes described below. The spectrum of effects produced by the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase are only now becoming understood. NO produces a wide variety of biological effects.
"Unfortunately, we are particularly ignorant of NO's role in modulating cellular processes in the nervous system. NO's role in regulating the vasculature is well documented and it appears to play a similarly important role in the nervous system. Under normal circumstances, NO contributes to the control of blood flow through the cerebrovasculature."
A rapid feedback mechanism necessarily exists to supply more active areas of the brain with the necessary nutrients. This mechanism is necessary because of the brain's feeble reserve of energy stores. NO is produced in neurons containing NOS that are undergoing sustained activity.
"These conditions favor activation of NMDA receptors, which is known to cause NO production. NO diffuses from these localized areas of high neuronal activity to the surrounding microvasculature  causing vasodilatation and increased blood flow. Although the exact mechanisms by which NO produces vasodilatation are not yet defined, it is known that activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in smooth muscle cells causes a relaxation of the vessels."
"Since one of NO's main targets is guanylyl cyclase , it is presumed that one major pathway for NO's vasodilatory actions is through cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Activation of this kinase leads indirectly to decreased Ca2+-levels in the smooth muscle cells and subsequently to the dephosphorylation of the myosin contractile apparatus which causes relaxation . In smooth muscle cells, NO also appears to directly hyperpolarize cells possibly by activating K+-channels, leading to the secondary closure of Ca2+ channels which also produces muscle relaxation."
"In conclusion, one of NO's main functions appears to be integrating the level of neuronal activity with local alterations in cerebral blood flow to maintain adequate perfusion of metabolically active tissue. NO is also thought to act as a locally diffusible messenger. It is produced by any action that elevates Ca2+ in cells containing NOS, such as glutamate stimulation of NMDA receptors."
"Through subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and production of cGMP, NO production influences a variety of secondary processes. These include direct modulation of ion channels, stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and both up-regulation or down-regulation of cAMP-phosphodiesterase. Downstream effects are then numerous and include up and down regulation of Ca2+ channels, increased excitability , increased or decreased neurotransmitter release, and changes in neuron morphology."
"NO in excess is toxic to cells. However, a paradox exists for NO toxicity. Cells that produce high levels of NO are resistant to its toxic effects."
"For example, NO toxicity is used by macrophages and neutrophils as a mechanism to kill tumor cells and bacteria. However, neither cell type producing NO is susceptible to its damaging effects. This finding is also true for neurons in the central nervous system."
"Excess glutamate induces neurotoxicity in the brain and is thought to be the primary cause of neuronal death in diseases such as Huntington's or Alzheimer's or after acute stroke or trauma. Excess production of NO is thought to play some role in this neuronal loss due to its toxicity when produced in excess. Interestingly, cells that stain positive for the enzyme NOS are spared in degenerating areas of the brain affected by these diseases."
The resistance of these cells appears to be similar to the resistance of the immune cells described above. Genetic and physical map of the X chromosome. Association of a trait with a position on a given chromosome is a critical step in gene identification.
The relationship between genetic loci is measured on a genetic map as the frequency of recombination events between the loci. On physical maps relationships between loci are measured in nucleotides. The genetic and physical maps have the same linear sequence although the distances are not correlated.
"After narrowing the chromosomal localization, a candidate gene can be localized on a genetic map that contains marker genes known to map to that chromosomal region. Subsequently, the gene can be localized on a physical map that allows delineation of its position with a higher degree of resolution. A recombination frequency of 1%  means that two genes recombine on average once in every 100 meiotic events."
This is equal to about 1000kb  of DNA sequence. A recombination frequency of 1%  means that two genes recombine on average once in every 100 meiotic events. This is equal to about 1000kb  of DNA sequence.
Genes that are close to each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. This allows for the use of polymorphic loci near a candidate gene to be used as markers to examine whether they cosegregate with a phenotype . Association of a marker allele with a disease gene.
"A mutation  takes place that produces a disease gene. This mutation occurs in a DNA background that contains other polymorphisms. During subsequent meiotic events allelic markers that are further away from the mutation will segregate away from it, while those that are close by will cosegregate, allowing an association between the disease gene and the cosegregating polymorphic markers."
"The associated region will depend on the number of meiotic events occurring after the mutation and the probability of recombination events in this stretch of DNA. A procedure by which any genetic trait is localized in the genome based on its segregation pattern with another marker or set of markers. Recombination of homologous chromosomal segments Frequency of recombination events depends on length of segments, the specific nucleotide sequence and its genomic location, and whether the event takes place in the male or female."
"The consequence of recombination is that different offspring receive equal, but not identical, genetic information from each parent. The genetic mapping of an unknown locus is established by examining the frequency with which it cosegregates with other previously mapped genetic markers. Mapping of anonymous markers and genes has allowed the construction of a fairly complete human genetic map."
A number of disease genes with Mendelian phenotypes have been localized on the human linkage map to allow positional cloning. This has been helpful for linkage studies with traits that do not obey simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Linkage analysis is a sequential procedure where data is collected until linkage is detected or refuted.
Linkage is based on a LOD score-a statistical evaluation of a set of data that examines the probability of joint segregation of two markers with a given recombination distance under the assumption of linkage or no linkage. The large majority of human diseases are NOT Mendelian . Familial aggregation of some genes  suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute.
The large majority of human diseases are NOT Mendelian . Familial aggregation of some genes  suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute. How can it be determined whether a disease results from mutations in a single gene or multiple genes ?
Likely single gene diseases are those in which a single biochemical step is altered . Highly complex disorders  are likely to be polygenic because of the wide-ranging disease phenotype. Individuals have been identified who possess early- or late-onset AD phenotype.
"The early-onset phenotype exhibits near-Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Three genes and one locus were isolated: Amyloid precursor protein , Presenilin-1 , Presenilin-2 , and apolipoprotein E . APP and PS-1 were isolated from early-onset linkage studies while ApoE was from late-onset studies."
"PS-2 was identified from an ethnic isolate. Huntington's disease follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. However, isolation of the gene underlying this disease was only possible by examining an isolated family in the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela."
"This family has 12,000 individuals, 258 have the disease, 1227 have 50% risk, 2885 have 25% risk and all are descendants from one woman who lived in the early 1800s. Linkage mapping enabled the localization of a single gene, the Huntington gene, that codes for the huntingtin protein. Mutations in the gene result in expanded triplet  repeats with the number of CAGs proportional to severity of symptoms which are motor and cognitive."
"Disorders affecting midbrain dopamine neurons include Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a single gene disease resulting from a mutation in the gene coding for huntingtin. In Huntington's disease, a population of neurons in the striatum degenerate presumably due to the presence of a mutated huntingtin protein."
The mechanism by which this mutated protein produces cell death is being intensely studied but is not yet clear. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that project to the striatum and nucleus accumbens. A candidate gene has been isolated but does not account for the entire phenotype.
"Understanding that a particular gene underlies a phenotype is the first step in trying to provide therapeutic benefits to patients carrying a mutation. However, there are considerable obstacles to overcome between finding the gene and being able to ""fix"" the mutation. The strategy employed to functionally ""fix"" mutations leading to inactive or partially active proteins involves supplying the ""correct"" gene to the cells needing to produce the inactive protein."
"The human nervous system is divided into the central nervous system  and the peripheral nervous system . The CNS, in turn, is divided into the brain and the spinal cord, which lie in the cranial cavity of the skull and the vertebral canal, respectively. The CNS and the PNS, acting in concert, integrate sensory information and control motor and cognitive functions."
"The adult human brain weighs between 1,200 to 1,500 g and contains about one trillion cells. It occupies a volume of about 1400 cc - approximately 2% of the total body weight, and receives 20% of the blood, oxygen, and calories supplied to the body. The adult spinal cord is approximately 40 to 50 cm long and occupies about 150 cc."
"The brain and the spinal cord arise in early development from the neural tube, which expands in the front of the embryo to form the three primary brain divisions: the prosencephalon , mesencephalon , and rhombencephalon  . These three vesicles further differentiate into five subdivisions: telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and the myelencephalon . The mesencephalon, metencephalon, and the myelencephalon comprise the brain stem."
"The telencephalon includes the cerebral cortex , which represents the highest level of neuronal organization and function . The cerebral cortex consists of various types of cortices  as well as closely related subcortical structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus, amygdala and the hippocampal formation . The diencephalon consists of a complex collection of nuclei lying symmetrically on either side of the midline."
"The diencephalon includes the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus and subthalamus . The mesencephalon  consists of several structures around the cerebral aqueduct such as the periaqueductal gray , the mesencephalic reticular formation, the substantia nigra, the red nucleus , the superior and inferior colliculi, the cerebral peduncles, some cranial nerve nuclei, and the projection of sensory and motor pathways. The metencephalon includes the pons and the cerebellum."
"The myelencephalon  includes the open and closed medulla, sensory and motor nuclei, projection of sensory and motor pathways, and some cranial nerve nuclei. The caudal end of the myelencephalon develops into the spinal cord. The spinal cord is an elongated cylindrical structure lying within the vertebral canal, which includes the central canal and the surrounding gray matter."
The gray matter is composed of neurons and their supporting cells and is enclosed by the white matter that is composed of a dense layer of ascending and descending nerve fibers. The spinal cord is an essential link between the peripheral nervous system and the brain; it conveys sensory information originating from different external and internal sites via 31 pairs of spinal nerves . These nerves make synaptic connections in the spinal cord or in the medulla oblongata and ascend to subcortical nuclei.
"The meninges are composed by three fibrous connective tissues . The most external is a dense collagenous connective tissue envelope known as the dura mater . The second, or the intermediated membrane, is a delicate non-vascular membrane of fine collagenous layer of reticular fibers forming a web-like membrane, known as the arachnoid ."
"It is separated from the inner pia layer by subarachnoid space, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The inner most delicate connective tissue membrane of collagenous is the pia mater, a thin translucent elastic membrane adherent to the surface of the brain and the spinal cord. Blood vessels located on the surface of the brain and the spinal cord are found on top of the pia matter."
"The meninges are subject to viral and bacterial infection known as meningitis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical treatment. The space between the skull and the dura is known as the epidural space. The space between the dura and the arachnoid is known as the subdural space."
"The space between the arachnoid and the pia is known as the subarachnoid space. In this space, there is a clear liquid known as the CSF. The CSF serves to support the CNS, and to cushion as well as protect it from physical shock and trauma."
"The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, which is composed of a specialized secretory ependymal layer located in the ventricular system. The space between the skull and the dura is known as the epidural space. The space between the dura and the arachnoid is known as the subdural space."
"The space between the arachnoid and the pia is known as the subarachnoid space. In this space, there is a clear liquid known as the CSF. The CSF serves to support the CNS, and to cushion as well as protect it from physical shock and trauma."
"The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, which is composed of a specialized secretory ependymal layer located in the ventricular system. In general, the CNS can be divided into three main functional components: the sensory system, the motor system, and homeostatic and higher brain functions. The sensory system consists of the somatosensory, viscerosensory, auditory, vestibular, olfactory, gustatory, and visual systems."
"The motor system consists of motor units, and the somatic  system, the spinal reflexes, the visceral  system, the cerebellum, several subcortical and cortical sites, as well as the brain stem ocular motor control system. The homeostatic and higher functional system includes the hypothalamus, cortical areas involved in motivation, insight, personality, language, memory, imagination, creativity, thinking, judgment, mental processing, and subcortical areas involved in learning, thought, consciousness, memory, attention, emotional state, sleep and arousal cycles. The largest and most obvious parts of the human brain are the cerebral hemispheres."
"The cerebrum has an outer layer - the cortex, which is composed of neurons and their supporting cells, and in living brain, has a gray color thus called the gray matter. Under the gray matter is the white matter, which is composed of myelinated ascending and descending nerve fibers, and in living brain have a white color. Embedded deep within the white matter are aggregates of neurons exhibiting gray color and known as subcortical nuclei."
"The cerebral hemispheres are partially separate from each other along the midline by the interhemispheric fissure  the falx cerebri ; Posteriorly, there is a transverse fissure that separates the cerebral hemisphere from the cerebellum, and contains the tentorium cerebellum. The hemispheres are connected by a large C-shaped fiber bundle, the corpus callosum, which carries information between the two hemispheres. For descriptive purposes each cerebral hemisphere can be divided into six lobes."
"Four of these lobes are named according to the overlying bones of the skull as follows: frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal , the fifth one is located internally to the lateral sulcus – the insular lobes , and the sixth lobe is the limbic lobe  which contains the limbic system nuclei. Neither the insular lobe nor the limbic lobe is a true lobe. Although the boundaries of the various lobes are somewhat arbitrary, the cortical areas in each lobe are histologically distinctive."
"The surface of the cerebral cortex is highly convoluted with folds , separate from each other by elongated grooves . These convolutions allow for the expansion of the cortical surface area without increasing the size of the brain. On the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere there are two major deep grooves-sulci , the lateral fissure  and the central sulci , these sulci provide landmarks for topographical orientation ."
"The central sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe and runs from the superior margin of the hemisphere near its midpoint obliquely downward and forward until it nearly meets the lateral fissure . The lateral fissure, separating the frontal and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe, begins inferiorly in the basal surface of the brain and extends laterally posteriorly and upward, separating the frontal and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe . The frontal lobe is the portion which is rostral to the central sulcus and above the lateral fissure, and it occupies the anterior one third of the hemispheres ."
"The boundaries of the parietal lobe are not precise, except for its rostral border – the central sulcus. The occipital lobe is the portion which is caudal to the parietal lobe . Along the lateral surface of the hemisphere, an imaginary line connecting the tip of the parietal-occipital sulcus and the preoccipital notch , separate the parietal lobe from the occipital lobe."
"On the medial surface of the hemisphere , parieto-occipital sulcus forms the rostral boundary of the parietal lobe. The temporal lobe lies ventral to the lateral sulcus, and on its lateral surface, it displays three diagonal oriented convolutions-the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri . The insula lies in the depths of the lateral sulcus."
It has a triangular cortical area with gyri and sulci . The limbic lobe consists of several cortical and subcortical areas . The cerebral cortex is a functionally organized organ.
"A functionally organized system is a set of neurons linked together to convey a specific type of information to accomplish a particular task. It is possible to identify on the cerebral cortex primary sensory areas, secondary sensory areas, primary motor area, premotor area, supplementary motor area and association areas, which are devoted to the integration of motor and sensory information, intellectual activity, thinking and comprehension, execution of language, memory storage and recall. The frontal lobe is the largest of the brain lobes and is comprised of four gyri, precentral gyrus that parallels the central sulcus, and three horizontal gyri: the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri."
"The inferior frontal gyrus is comprised of three parts: the orbital, the triangular and opercular. The term opercular refers to the “lips of the lateral fissure. Finally, the straight gyrus  and the orbital gyri form the base of the frontal lobe ."
"Four general functional areas are in the frontal lobe. They are the primary motor cortex, where all parts of the body are represented, the premotor and supplementary motor areas. A region concerned with the motor mechanisms of speech formulation comprised of the opercular and triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus are known as Broca’s speech area, and the remainder of the prefrontal cortex is involved in mental activity, personality insight, foresight, and reward."
"The orbital portion of the prefrontal cortex is important in the appropriate switching between mental sets and the regulation of emotion. The parietal lobe is comprised of three gyri: postcentral gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyri . The postcentral gyrus is immediately behind the central sulcus which forms its anterior boundary."
"The postcentral gyrus comprises the primary somatosensory cortex which is concerned with somatosensory reception, integration and processing sensory information from the surface of the body and from the viscera, and is important for the formulation of perception. Caudal to the postcentral gyrus is the inferior parietal gyrus. The intraparietal sulcus separates the posterior parietal gyrus from the inferior parietal gyrus."
"The inferior parietal gyrus represents the cortical association area which integrates and processes sensory information from multiple modalities such as auditory and visual information. The inferior parietal gyrus, which is known as Wernicke's area, is also important for language and reading skills, whereas the superior parietal gyrus is concerned with body image and spatial orientations. The temporal lobe is formed by three obliquely oriented gyri: the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri ."
"Inferomedial to the inferior temporal gyrus are the occipitotemporal and the parahippocampal gyri, which are separated by the collateral sulcus. The upper surface of the superior temporal gyrus, which extends into the lateral fissure, is called the transverse temporal gyrus  and is the primary auditory cortex. The caudal part of the superior temporal gyrus, which extends up to the parietal cortex, forms part of Wernicke’s area."
"Wernicke’s area is concerned, in part, with processing the auditory information and is important in the comprehension of language. The inferior part of the temporal lobe  is involved in visual and cognitive processing. More medially is the parahippocampal gyrus, which is involved in learning and memory."
"Portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, which are adjacent to the lateral sulcus and overlie the insular cortex, are known as the operculum. The inferomedial surface of the temporal lobe is made up of the uncus and the parahippocampal gyrus medially. The inferior surface of the temporal lobe rests on the tentorium cerebelli."
"The occipital lobe is the most caudal part of the brain, lies on the tentorium cerebelli  and is comprised of several irregular lateral gyri. On its medial surface, there is a prominent fissure – the calcarine fissure and parieto-occipital sulcus. The calcarine fissure  and the parieto-occipital sulcus also define a cortical region known as the cuneus."
The cuneus sulcus divides the occipital lobe into the cuneus dorsally and ventrally into the lingual gyrus. The occipital lobe contains the primary and higher-order visual cortex. The insula lobe is located deep inside the lateral fissure and can be seen only when the temporal and the frontal lobes are separated .
"The insula is characterized by several long gyri and sulci, the gyri breves and gyri longi. There is some evidence that the insular cortical areas are involved in nociception and regulation of autonomic function. The limbic lobe is not a true lobe and is comprised of several cortical regions such as the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri, some subcortical areas like the hippocampus, amygdala, septum, and other areas with their respective ascending and descending connections ."
"The limbic lobe is involved in memory and learning, drive related behavior, and emotional function. There are subcortical areas in the telencephalon like the basal ganglia and the amygdaloid nucleus complex. The corpus callosum is a collection of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres."
"The corpus callosum is divided into rostrum , body, the most rostrally part is the genu  with connecting the rostrum and the body, and the splenium at the caudal extremity . The corpus callosum plays an important role in transferring information from one hemisphere to the other. There are subcortical areas in the telencephalon like the basal ganglia and the amygdaloid nucleus complex."
"The corpus callosum is a collection of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres. The corpus callosum is divided into rostrum , body, the most rostrally part is the genu  with connecting the rostrum and the body, and the splenium at the caudal extremity . The corpus callosum plays an important role in transferring information from one hemisphere to the other."
"The brain stem consists of mesencephalon , metencephalon, and myelencephalon. The metencephalon and myelencephalon together compose the rhombencephalon , which divides into pons, and medulla oblongata . Mesencephalon  is continuous with the diencephalon rostrally and with the pons caudally."
"The midbrain is the smallest part of the brain stem, being about 2 cm in length. It consists of a tectum posteriorly, a tegmentum inferiorly, and a base anteriorly. The tectum forms the roof of the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the third ventricle with the fourth ventricle and the tegmentum its floor."
"The base of the midbrain consists of the cerebral peduncle, which contain nerve fibers descending from the cerebral cortex. The nuclei of the 3rd , the 4th  and part of the 5th  are located in the midbrain tegmentum. The red nucleus and the substantia nigra, two prominent nuclei, are also found in the midbrain tegmentum."
"The midbrain tectum is formed by two pairs of rounded structures: the superior and inferior colliculi. The superior and inferior colliculi  are involved in visual and auditory functions respectively. Pons is continuous with the midbrain and is composed of two parts, the pontine tegmentum  and the basilar pons."
"At the level of the pons, the cerebral aqueduct has expanded to form the fourth ventricle . The cerebellum is situated posterior to the pons and forms part of the roof  of the forth ventricle. The pons contains nuclei that receive axons from various cortical areas."
"Projections from the axons of these pontine neurons form large transverse fiber bundles that traverse the pons and ascend to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncles. Also, within the pons base and tegmentum are longitudinally ascending and descending fibers. The nuclei of the 5th , 6th , 7th  and the 8th  nerves are located in the pons tegmentum."
Medulla Oblongata . The medulla lies between the pons rostrally and the spinal cord caudally. It is continuous with the spinal cord just above to foramen magnum and the first spinal nerve.
"The posterior surface of the medulla forms the caudal half of the fourth ventricle floor and the cerebellum, its roof . The base of the medulla is formed by the pyramidal-descending fibers from the cerebral cortex. The medulla tegmentum contains ascending and descending fibers and nuclei from the 9th , 10th , 11th  and the 12th  nerves."
"The corticospinal fibers  are alongside the anterior median fissure, and decussate  to the contralateral side on their way to the spinal cord. Other prominent structures in the medulla are the inferior olive, and the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The medulla contains nuclei which regulate respiration, swallowing, sweating, gastric secretion, cardiac, and vasomotor activity."

Other prominent structures in the medulla are the inferior olive, and the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The medulla contains nuclei which regulate respiration, swallowing, sweating, gastric secretion, cardiac, and vasomotor activity."
"The arterial blood supply to the spinal cord is derived from two branches of vertebral artery, the anterior and two posterior spinal arteries which run the length of the spinal cord and form an irregular plexus around it . The PNS includes 31 pairs of spinal nerves, 12 pairs of cranial nerves, the autonomic nervous system and the ganglia  associated with them. Also included in the PNS are the sensory receptor organs."
"The receptor organs are scattered in all parts of the body, sense and perceive changes from external and internal organs, then transform this information to electrical signals, which are carried via an extensive nervous network to the CNS . The cranial and spinal nerves contain nerve fibers that conduct information to-afferent- and from-efferent  the CNS. Afferent fibers convey sensory information from sensory receptors in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs and from the eye, ear, nose and mouth to the CNS; the efferent fibers convey signals from cortical and subcortical centers to the spinal cord and from there to the muscle or autonomic ganglia that innervate the visceral organs."
"The afferent  fibers enter the spinal cord via the dorsal  root, and the efferent  fibers exit the spinal cord via the ventral  root. The spinal nerve is formed by the joining of the dorsal and the ventral roots. The cranial nerves leave the skull and the spinal cord nerves leave the vertebrae through openings in the bone called foramina ."
"The PNS is divided into two systems: the visceral system and the somatic system. The visceral system is also known as the autonomic system. The autonomic nervous system  is often considered a separate entity; although composed partially in the PNS and partially in the CNS, it interfaces between the PNS and the CNS."
"The primary function of the ANS is to regulate and control unconsciousness functions including visceral, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, vessels, and glandular function . The ANS can be divided into three subdivisions: The sympathetic  subdivision associated with neurons located in the spinal gray between the thoracic and the upper lumbar levels; The parasympathetic  subdivision is associated with the 3rd, 7th, 9th and the 10th cranial nerves as well as with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sacral nerves; The enteric subdivision is a complex neuronal network within the walls of the gastrointestinal system and contains more neurons than the spinal cord. The visceral  system regulates the internal organs outside the realm of conscious control."
"The PNS component of the somatic system includes the sensory receptors and the neurons innervating them and their nerve fibers entering the spinal cord. The visceral and the somatic nervous system are primarily concerned with their own functions, but also work in harmony with other aspects of the nervous system. This section illustrates representative sections through the CNS in order to acquaint the reader with prominent structures and help in the recognition of the level and orientation of the section."
It also provides landmarks for locating nuclei and tracts involved in sensory and motor functions. Directional terms are used in describing the locations of structures in the CNS. Keep in mind that certain terms were developed to describe the nervous system of quadrupeds and may have a slightly different meaning when applied to bipeds.
"For example, the ventral surface of the quadruped spinal cord is comparable to the anterior surface of the biped . In the following descriptions, the terms are applied to a standing human. The terms rostral and anterior refer to a direction towards the face/nose."
The terms caudal and posterior refer to a direction towards the buttocks/tail. The terms inferior and superior generally refer to spatial relationships in a vertical direction . A coronal section is parallel to the vertical plane and a midcoronal section would divide the head into anterior and posterior halves .
"The sagittal section is also parallel to the vertical plane, but a midsagittal section would divide the head into right and left halves. The horizontal  section is parallel to the horizontal plane and a mid-horizontal section would divide the head into superior and inferior halves. Transverse or cross sections of the spinal cord of humans are taken in a plane perpendicular to the vertical ."
"Most electromagnetic imaging techniques produce images of the brain in the coronal, horizontal  and sagittal planes. The representative sections are transverse sections through the spinal cord and brain stem and coronal sections through the telencephalon and diencephalon . Transverse Section through the Spinal Cord."
Figure 1. 17A illustrates a section taken at the level of the thoracic spinal cord. The spinal cord neuron  form a central core taking a butterfly configuration that is surrounded by nerve fibers .
"In the left and right halves of the spinal cord, the gray matter is organized into a dorsal horn and ventral horn with the intermediate gray located between them. In the thoracic spinal cord, which is illustrated in this figure, a lateral horn extends laterally from the intermediate gray . The spinal cord white matter is subdivided into the posterior white column, the anterior white column and the lateral white column."
The anterior white commissure joins the two halves of the spinal cord and is located ventral to the intermediate gray. The dorsal root fibers enter the spinal cord at the dorsolateral sulcus and the fibers of the ventral root fibers exit the spinal cord in numerous fine bundles through the ventral funiculus . Transverse Section through the Medulla.
"Figure 1. 17B is a section taken at the level of the upper medulla. Landmark structures include the fourth ventricle, hypoglossal nucleus, inferior cerebellar peduncle, inferior olivary complex and the pyramids."
"As in the spinal cord section, the fiber tracts, the inferior cerebellar peduncle and pyramids, appear light in this section whereas the nuclei in the inferior olivary complex appear dark. Transverse Section through the Pons. Figure 1."
"17C is a section taken at the level of the mid pons. Landmark structures include the fourth ventricle, the pons tegmentum, which includes the abducens nuclei; the pons base, which includes the corticofugal fibers and pontine nuclei; and the middle cerebellar peduncles. Coronal Section through the Rostral Telencephalon."
"Figure 1. 17D is a section taken at the level of the decussation of the anterior commissure. Landmark structures include the head of the caudate nucleus, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the globus pallidus and putamen ."
"The anterior commissure, a fiber bundle connecting the right and left frontal lobes, can be seen decussating . The corpus callosum forms a thick band of decussating nerve fibers located above the lateral ventricles. Below the telencephalon afferent nerve fibers from each eye decussate in the optic chiasm and join uncrossed fibers to form the optic tract."
Coronal Section through the Midbrain-Diencephalon Junction. Figure 1. 17E is a section taken at the level of the junction of the midbrain with the diencephalon.
"Notice that the plane of section differs from those of the previous sections. At this level, a landmark structure of the diencephalon is the thalamus, which surrounds the third ventricle. The posterior limb of the internal capsule separates the thalamus from the surrounding telencephalic structures ."
"Lateral to the putamen is the insula while more dorsomedially the corpus callosum overlies the cavities of the lateral ventricles. Below the third ventricle are the red nucleus, substantia nigra and crus cerebri of the midbrain, which are the continuation of the internal capsule. Section through the Midbrain."
"Figure 1. 17F is a section that shows the main midbrain nuclei which include the tectum  the periaqueductal gray, the red nuclei, substantia nigra and the cerebral peduncles. The somatosensory systems inform us about objects in our external environment through touch  and about the position and movement of our body parts  through the stimulation of muscle and joints."
"The somatosensory systems also monitor the temperature of the body, external objects and environment, and provide information about painful, itchy and tickling stimuli. The sensory information processed by the somatosensory systems travels along different anatomical pathways depending on the information carried. For example, the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway carries discriminative touch and proprioceptive information from the body, and the main sensory trigeminal pathway carries this information from the face."
"Whereas, the spinothalamic pathways carry crude touch, pain and temperature information from the body, and the spinal trigeminal pathway carries this information from the face. This first series of chapters on somatosensory systems concentrates on the somatosensory systems that provide accurate information about the location and temporal features of stimuli and about sharp pain, tactile stimuli and the position and movement of body parts. This chapter describes somatosensory stimuli, the sensations produced when they are applied, and the cutaneous, muscle, and joint receptors that are responsible for initiating the perceived somatic sensations."
"Subsequent chapters describe the pathways processing other pain, temperature, crude touch and visceral sensations. Modality Specificity in the Somatosensory System. The somatosensory systems process information about, and represent, several modalities of somatic sensation ."
"Each of these modalities can be divided into sub-modalities, as shown in Table 1 . Discriminative touch is also subdivided into touch, pressure, flutter and vibration. Each of these sensations  is represented by neurons that exhibit modality specificity."
"That is, when a somatosensory neuron is stimulated naturally  or artificially , the sensation perceived is specific to the information normally processed by the neuron . Consequently, a ""warm"" somatosensory neuron will not respond to cooling of the skin or to a touch stimulus that does not ""warm"" the skin. The somatosensory receptor and its central connections determine the modality specificity of the neurons forming a somatosensory pathway."
"Tactile Stimuli. Tactile stimuli are external forces in physical contact with the skin that give rise to the sensations of touch, pressure, flutter, or vibration. We normally think of touch as involving minimal force on-or-by an object that produces very little distortion of the skin."
"In contrast, pressure involves a greater force that displaces the skin and underlying tissue. Time varying tactile stimuli produce more complex sensations such as object movement or object flutter  or vibration . An initial clinical examination of discriminative touch often involves testing the vibratory sense by applying a 128 Hz tuning fork over a bony prominence."
"Proprioceptive Stimuli. 1 Proprioceptive stimuli are internal forces that are generated by the position or movement of a body part. Static forces on the joints, muscles and tendons, which maintain limb position against the force of gravity, indicate the position of a limb."
"The movement of a limb is indicated by dynamic changes in the forces applied to muscles, tendons and joints. An initial clinical examination of proprioception often involves testing the position sense by having the patient, with eyes closed, touch one finger with another after the target finger has been moved. Proprioception is critical for maintaining posture and balance."
"Somatosensory proprioceptive cues are combined with vestibular proprioceptive cues and visual cues to control motor responses to changes in body/head position. During a clinical examination, the Romberg test requires the patient to maintain balance while standing with feet together and eyes closed. It tests whether the proprioceptive components are working properly when the visual cues are missing and proprioceptive cues are the major sources of information."
"Sharp Cutting Pain Stimuli. Painful  stimuli are tissue-damaging sources of energy that may be external or internal to the body surface. Sharp, cutting pain is the sensation elicited on initial contact with the painful stimulus."
"The sensation of dull, burning pain may follow as a consequence of tissue inflammation. An initial clinical examination of the pain sense often involves testing sharp, cutting pain sensitivity by asking the patient, who has her/his eyes closed, what they feel when pricked with a pin. Pain mechanisms and pathways are described in detail in later chapters."
Peripheral Somatosensory Neurons. The cell bodies of the first-order  somatosensory afferent neurons2 are located in posterior root or cranial root ganglia . The 1° afferents are pseudounipolar cells.
"The cell body gives rise to a single process that divides to form a peripheral axon and a central axon. The peripheral axon travels to and ends in the skin, muscle, tendon or joint and the central axon travels to and ends in the central nervous system. Somatosensory Receptor Organ."
"The receptors of most sensory systems are located in specialized sensory receptor organs  or within a restricted part of the body . For the tactile component of the somatosensory system, the skin covering the entire body, head and face functions as the touch receptor organ, whereas joint tissues, muscles and tendons act as the proprioception receptor organs. These sensory receptor organs ""house"" the somatosensory receptors and deliver the somatosensory stimuli to the receptors."
"Sensory Receptors. Specialized sensory receptor cells  are located in specialized receptor organs, produce receptor potentials, contain synaptic specializations, and release neural transmitters . Specialized sensory receptors may be modified neurons  or modified epithelial cells ."
"There is only one type of sensory receptor cell in the somatosensory system, the Merkel cells, and they are found only in skin. The vast majority of somatosensory receptors are not specialized receptor cells. That is, they are formed by the endings of the somatosensory 1° afferent peripheral axon and adjacent tissue ."
"There is no synaptic specialization or neurotransmitter within the adjacent tissue. The adjacent tissue also does not generate receptor potentials. Instead of ending on specialized receptors, most peripheral axons of somatosensory 1° afferents travel to skin, muscle or joint, branch near their terminal sites, and end in the skin , muscle, tendon or joint tissue."
"All the peripheral terminal branches of a 1° somatosensory axon end in a specific type of tissue  and not in multiple types of tissue . All the peripheral terminal branches of a 1° axon form only one type of somatosensory receptor. Many of the 1° somatosensory afferent terminals are enveloped in a connective tissue capsule along with surrounding muscle, tendon or cutaneous cells, or end on hair follicles."
"The hair follicles and the encapsulated tissue adjacent to the 1° afferent terminals  contain no synaptic specializations and do not generate receptor potentials or release neural transmitters. The complex of encapsulated tissue and afferent endings and the complex of hair follicle and afferent endings play a role in the receptor transduction process, and each complex is considered to form a ""somatosensory receptor"". Many other 1° somatosensory axons branch and terminate in skin, muscle, or joint as free nerve endings."
"These endings are bare of myelin, are not encapsulated and are not associated with a specific type of tissue. The sensitivity of the receptors to specific stimuli  is determined by the location of the receptor and by the non-neural tissue surrounding the 1° afferent terminal . The Adequate Stimulus."
"The adequate somatosensory stimulus  is either a mechanical force, a temperature change, tissue damage, or a chemical action. The discriminative touch and proprioceptive systems are most sensitive to mechanical force. Consequently, their sensory receptors are of the mechanoreceptor category."
Sensory Transduction. The non-neural tissue surrounding the peripheral ending of the somatosensory 1° afferent helps concentrate and deliver the stimulus  onto the 1° afferent terminal membrane. Somatosensory mechanoreceptors function to transduce the applied mechanical force into an electrical potential change in the 1° afferent neuron.
"The mechanoreceptor 1° afferent terminal membrane contains ion channels that respond to mechanical distortion by increasing sodium and potassium conductance . Generator potentials are produced as sodium and potassium flow down their electrochemical gradients to depolarize the terminal ending . In most cases, the magnitude and duration of the generator potentials are related to the applied mechanical force: the greater the mechanical force, the greater is the depolarization, and the longer the mechanical force is applied, the longer the terminal remains depolarized ."
Terminals that do not sustain the depolarization for the duration of the mechanical distortion are called rapidly adapting. Terminals that sustain the depolarization with minimal decrease in amplitude for the duration of a stimulus are called slowly adapting. The generator potential spreads passively along the 1° terminal fiber to the axon trigger zone - that part of the 1° afferent axon containing voltage-sensitive sodium and potassium channels .
"If the depolarization reaches threshold at these voltage-sensitive sites, action potentials are generated by the 1° afferent peripheral axon. When the action potentials reach the central terminals of the 1° afferent, they initiate the release neurotransmitters on 2° afferents within spinal cord or brain stem nuclei. If, as in the example in Figure 2."
"8, the generator potential is slowly adapting, the 1° afferent produces a sustained discharge of action potentials that continue for the duration of the stimulus. If the generator potential is rapidly adapting , the 1° afferent produces a transient, short burst of action potentials and falls silent even in the continued presence of the stimulus. The rapidly adapting receptors produce generator potentials and action potential discharges that follow the time-varying waveform of pressure changes produced by a vibrating stimulus ."
"In contrast, the slowing adapting receptors produce generator potentials and action potential discharges that are sustained and unable to mimic the time-varying pattern of the stimulus . Consequently, the responses of rapidly adapting 1° afferents are best suited for representing time varying  stimuli, whereas slowly adapting 1° afferents better represent static stimuli . Some of the somatosensory receptors in skin  are classified as encapsulated receptors as the 1° afferent terminal and surrounding cutaneous tissue are encapsulated by a thin sheath ."
"The encapsulated cutaneous receptors include Meissner corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini corpuscles . Other cutaneous receptors are unencapsulated and include the hair follicle receptor  and the Merkel complex . The sensory receptors of the crude touch, pain and temperature senses are bare or free nerve endings."
"That is, they are unencapsulated, do not end on or near specialized tissue, and may be mechanoreceptors, nociceptors or thermoreceptors. As was noted earlier, the sensitivity  of the somatosensory receptor is determined by its location and by the structure of the non-neural tissue surrounding the 1° afferent terminal. The following describes the most commonly observed cutaneous receptors."
"Meissner Corpuscle. The Meissner corpuscle is found in glabrous  skin, within the dermal papillae . It consists of an elongated, encapsulated stack of flattened epithelial  cells with 1° afferent terminal fibers interdigitated between the cells ."
"A force applied to non-hairy skin  causes the laminar cells in the Meissner corpuscle to slide past one another, which distorts the membranes of the axon terminals located between these cells. If the force is maintained, the laminar cells remain in a fixed, albeit, displaced position, and the shearing force on the axon terminals' membranes disappears. Consequently, the 1° afferent axons produce a transient, rapidly adapting response to a sustained mechanical stimulus."
"The Meissner 1° afferent discharges ""follow"" low frequency vibrating  stimuli, which produces the sensation of ""flutter"" . Because a single 1° afferent axon forms many, dispersed  Meissner corpuscles, the 1° afferent can detect and signal small movements across the skin. Stimulation of a sequence of Meissner corpuscles have been described to produce the perception of localized movement along the skin."
"Consequently, Meissner corpuscles are considered to be the discriminative touch system's flutter and movement detecting receptors in non-hairy skin. Pacinian Corpuscle. Pacinian corpuscles are found in subcutaneous tissue beneath the dermis  and in the connective tissues of bone, the body wall and body cavity."
"Therefore, they can be cutaneous, proprioceptive or visceral receptors, depending on their location. The Pacinian corpuscle is football-shaped, encapsulated, and contains concentrically layered epithelial  cells . In cross section, the Pacinian corpuscle looks like a slice of onion, with a single 1° afferent terminal fiber located in its center."
"The outer layers of laminar cells contain fluid that is displaced when a force is applied on the corpuscle. When a force is first applied on the Pacinian corpuscle , it initially displaces the laminar cells and distorts the axon terminal membrane. If the external pressure is maintained on the corpuscle, the displacement of fluid in the outer laminar cells dissipates the applied force on the axon terminal."
"Consequently, a sustained force on the corpuscle is transformed into a transient force on the axon terminal, and the Pacinian corpuscle 1° afferent produces a fast adapting response. Pacinian corpuscles 1° afferent axons are most sensitive to vibrating stimuli  and unresponsive to steady pressure. The sensation elicited when cutaneous Pacinian corpuscles are stimulated is of vibration or tickle."
"Pacinian corpuscles in skin are considered to be the vibration sensitive receptors of the discriminative touch system. Ruffini Corpuscle. The Ruffini corpuscles are found deep in the skin , as well as in joint ligaments and joint capsules and can function as cutaneous or proprioceptive receptors depending on their location."
"The Ruffini corpuscle  is cigar-shaped, encapsulated, and contains longitudinal strands of collagenous fibers that are continuous with the connective tissue of the skin or joint. Within the capsule, the 1° afferent fiber branches repeatedly and its branches are intertwined with the encapsulated collagenous fibers. The Ruffini corpuscles are oriented with their long axes parallel to the surface of the skin and are most sensitive to skin stretch."
"Stretching the skin  stretches the collagen fibers within the Ruffini corpuscle, which compresses the axon terminals. As the collagen fibers remain stretched and the axon terminals remain compressed during the skin stretch, the Ruffini corpuscle's 1° afferent axon produces a sustained slowly adapting discharge to maintained stimuli. Ruffini corpuscles in skin are considered to be skin stretch sensitive receptors of the discriminative touch system."
They also work with the proprioceptors in joints and muscles to indicate the position and movement of body parts. Hair Follicle. The hair follicle receptor is an unencapsulated cutaneous receptor .
The 1° afferent terminal axons spiral around the hair follicle base or run parallel to the hair shaft forming a lattice-like pattern . Most hair follicle 1° afferents are the fast-adapting type; displacement of the hair produces a transient discharge of action potentials at the onset of the displacement and a maintained displacement of the hair often fails to produce a sustained discharge . The hair follicle afferents respond best to moving objects and signal the direction and velocity of the movement of a stimulus brushing against hairy skin.
"As Meissner corpuscles are absent from hairy skin, the hair follicle endings are considered to be the discriminative touch system's movement sensitive receptors in hairy skin. Merkel Complex. The Merkel complex is found in both hairy and non-hairy skin and is located in the basal layer of the epidermis ."
"The Merkel complex is unencapsulated and consists of a specialized receptor cell, the Merkel cell, and a 1° afferent terminal ending, the Merkel disk3 . Thick, short, finger-like protrusions of the Merkel cell couple it tightly to the surrounding tissue. The Merkel cell is a modified epithelial cell, which contains synaptic vesicles that appear to release neuropeptides that modulate the activity of the 1° afferent terminal."
"Each 1° afferent axon often innervates only a few Merkel cells in a discrete patch of skin . A force applied to the skin overlying the Merkel cell distorts it , which stimulates its release of a neuropeptide at its synaptic junctions with the Merkel disk. As the Merkel cell is mechanically coupled to the surrounding skin, it remains distorted for the duration of the force applied on the overlying skin."
"Consequently, the Merkel complex 1° afferent axon responds to small forces applied to a discrete patch of skin with a slowly adapting, sustained discharge. Merkel cells are considered to be the fine tactile receptors of the discriminative touch system that provide cues used to localize tactile stimuli and to perceive the edges  of objects. Free Nerve Endings."
"Free nerve endings are found throughout the body, in skin , muscles, tendons, joints, mucous membranes, cornea, body mesentery, the dura, the viscera, etc. The free nerve endings in skin are stimulated by tissue-damaging  stimuli that produce the sensation of pain or by cooling of the skin or the warming of skin or by touch. Notice that although all cutaneous free nerve endings appear very similar morphologically, there are different functional types of free nerve endings, with each responding to specific types of cutaneous stimuli ."
"Free nerve endings are considered to be the somatosensory receptors for pain, temperature and crude touch. Proprioceptors are located in muscles, tendons, joint ligaments and in joint capsules. There are no specialized sensory receptor cells for body proprioception4."
"In skeletal  muscle, there are two types of encapsulated proprioceptors, muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs , as well as numerous free nerve endings. Within the joints, there are encapsulated endings similar to those in skin, as well as numerous free nerve endings. Muscle Spindles."
"Muscle spindles are found in nearly all striated muscles. A muscle spindle is encapsulated and consists of small muscle fibers, called intrafusal muscle fibers, and afferent and efferent nerve terminals . Intrafusal muscles are found exclusively in muscle spindle receptors and are distributed throughout the body among the ordinary extrafusal muscle fibers of skeletal muscles."
"The intrafusal fibers are attached to the larger, surrounding extrafusal muscle fibers. They are oriented in parallel with the extrafusal fibers but do not contribute directly to muscle strength when they contract because of their small size. There are two types of afferent terminals in the muscle spindle ."
"The annulospiral endings wrap around the central region of the intrafusal fibers, whereas the flower-spray endings terminate predominantly in more polar regions  of the intrafusal fibers. The 1° afferents forming the annulospiral endings are called the primary muscle spindle afferents, whereas those forming the flower-spray endings are called the secondary muscle spindle afferents. In addition to afferent terminals, the terminals  of gamma motor neurons end on intrafusal muscle fibers."
"They will be described in detail in the chapters covering motor systems. In summary, the muscle spindles are proprioceptors specialized to monitor muscle length  and signal the rate of change in muscle length by changing the discharge rate of afferent action potentials. Muscle spindles are most numerous in muscles that carry out fine movements, such as the extraocular muscles and the intrinsic muscles of the hand."
There are fewer spindles in large muscles that control gross movements of the body . Golgi Tendon Organs. Golgi tendon organs are found in the tendons of striated extrafusal muscles near the muscle-tendon junction .
"Golgi tendon organs resemble Ruffini corpuscles. For example, they are encapsulated and contain intertwining collagen bundles, which are continuous with the muscle tendon, and fine branches of afferent fibers that weave between the collagen bundles . They are functionally ""in series"" with striated muscle."
"The Golgi tendon organ collagen fibers are continuous with the extrafusal muscle at one end and with the muscle tendon at its opposite end. Consequently, the mechanical force on the organ is maximal when the extrafusal muscles contract, shorten, and increase the tension on the tendon. When the muscles contract, the 1° afferent terminals are compressed and remain compressed as long as the muscle remains contracted."
"The Golgi tendon organ 1° afferent response to sustained isometric muscle contraction is slowly adapting, and the 1° afferent generates action potentials as long as the tension is maintained. The responses of the Golgi tendon organ 1° afferent axon is maximal when the contracted muscle bears a load, e. g."
", when lifting a heavy object. The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptor that monitors and signals muscle contraction against a force , whereas the muscle spindle is a proprioceptor that monitors and signals muscle stretch . Joint Receptors."
"Joint receptors are found within the connective tissue, capsule and ligaments of joints . The encapsulated endings resemble the Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles and the Golgi tendon organs. The joint 1° afferents respond to changes in the angle, direction, and velocity of movement in a joint."
"The responses are predominantly rapidly adapting with few joint 1° afferents signaling the resting  position of the joint. It has been suggested that information from muscles, tendons, skin and joints are combined to provide estimates of joint position and movement. For example, when the hip joint is replaced — removing all joint receptors — the ability to detect the position of the thigh relative to the pelvis is not lost."
"Free Nerve Endings. As mentioned above, free nerve endings of 1° afferents are abundant in muscles, tendons, joints, and ligaments. These free nerve endings are considered to be the somatosensory receptors for pain resulting from muscle, tendon, joint, or ligament damage and are not considered to be part of the proprioceptive system."
"In this chapter, you have learned about somatosensory stimuli and the receptors of three components of the somatosensory systems. These three components provide accurate information about the location, shape, texture, and movement of tactile stimuli, , the position and movement of body parts  and the application and location of painful stimuli . Tactile and proprioceptive stimuli are the mechanical forces produced when skin contacts external objects , limbs oppose the force of gravity  and muscles contract and body parts move."
"Painful stimuli are tissue-damaging forces. The sensations produced are those of touch, pressure, flutter, and vibration/movement , body position and movement , and sharp cutting pain. The discriminative touch receptors are encapsulated 1° afferent terminals , hair follicle endings and Merkel complexes in skin."
The proprioceptive receptors in muscle are also encapsulated and include the muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ. The joint receptors are similar to the encapsulated endings in skin and tendon and are found in the joint capsule and ligaments. The sharp cutting nociceptors are free nerve endings.
"Although it is convenient to subdivide somatosensory receptors and pathways for didactic, clinical and research purposes, it is important to keep in mind that most somatosensory stimuli act simultaneously and in varying degrees on all somatosensory receptors in the body part stimulated. For example, placing a heavy, cold object in an outstretched hand produces tactile, thermal, and proprioceptive sensations that allow us to appreciate the presence , temperature, and weight of the object and provide proprioceptive information for finger, wrist and arm adjustments so we do not drop the object. The spinal cord is the most important structure between the body and the brain."
"The spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum where it is continuous with the medulla to the level of the first or second lumbar vertebrae. It is a vital link between the brain and the body, and from the body to the brain. The spinal cord is 40 to 50 cm long and 1 cm to 1."
5 cm in diameter. Two consecutive rows of nerve roots emerge on each of its sides. These nerve roots join distally to form 31 pairs of spinal nerves.
"The spinal cord is a cylindrical structure of nervous tissue composed of white and gray matter, is uniformly organized and is divided into four regions: cervical , thoracic , lumbar  and sacral , , each of which is comprised of several segments. The spinal nerve contains motor and sensory nerve fibers to and from all parts of the body. Each spinal cord segment innervates a dermatome ."
"Although the spinal cord constitutes only about 2% of the central nervous system , its functions are vital. Knowledge of spinal cord functional anatomy makes it possible to diagnose the nature and location of cord damage and many cord diseases. Although the spinal cord constitutes only about 2% of the central nervous system , its functions are vital."
"Knowledge of spinal cord functional anatomy makes it possible to diagnose the nature and location of cord damage and many cord diseases. The cord is segmentally organized. There are 31 segments, defined by 31 pairs of nerves exiting the cord."
"These nerves are divided into 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal nerve . Dorsal and ventral roots enter and leave the vertebral column respectively through intervertebral foramen at the vertebral segments corresponding to the spinal segment. The cord is sheathed in the same three meninges as is the brain: the pia, arachnoid and dura."
"The dura is the tough outer sheath, the arachnoid lies beneath it, and the pia closely adheres to the surface of the cord . The spinal cord is attached to the dura by a series of lateral denticulate ligaments emanating from the pial folds. During the initial third month of embryonic development, the spinal cord extends the entire length of the vertebral canal and both grow at about the same rate."
"As development continues, the body and the vertebral column continue to grow at a much greater rate than the spinal cord proper. This results in displacement of the lower parts of the spinal cord with relation to the vertebrae column. The outcome of this uneven growth is that the adult spinal cord extends to the level of the first or second lumbar vertebrae, and the nerves grow to exit through the same intervertebral foramina as they did during embryonic development."
"This growth of the nerve roots occurring within the vertebral canal, results in the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal roots extending to their appropriate vertebral levels . All spinal nerves, except the first, exit below their corresponding vertebrae. In the cervical segments, there are 7 cervical vertebrae and 8 cervical nerves ."
"C1-C7 nerves exit above their vertebrae whereas the C8 nerve exits below the C7 vertebra. It leaves between the C7 vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. Therefore, each subsequent nerve leaves the cord below the corresponding vertebra."
"In the thoracic and upper lumbar regions, the difference between the vertebrae and cord level is three segments. Therefore, the root filaments of spinal cord segments have to travel longer distances to reach the corresponding intervertebral foramen from which the spinal nerves emerge. The lumbosacral roots are known as the cauda equina ."
"Each spinal nerve is composed of nerve fibers that are related to the region of the muscles and skin that develops from one body somite . A spinal segment is defined by dorsal roots entering and ventral roots exiting the cord,  . A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by peripheral nerve fibers originating from a single dorsal root ganglion."
"If a nerve is cut, one loses sensation from that dermatome. Because each segment of the cord innervates a different region of the body, dermatomes can be precisely mapped on the body surface, and loss of sensation in a dermatome can indicate the exact level of spinal cord damage in clinical assessment of injury . It is important to consider that there is some overlap between neighboring dermatomes."
"Because sensory information from the body is relayed to the CNS through the dorsal roots, the axons originating from dorsal root ganglion cells are classified as primary sensory afferents, and the dorsal root's neurons are the first order  sensory neuron. Most axons in the ventral roots arise from motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and innervate skeletal muscle. Others arise from the lateral horn and synapse on autonomic ganglia that innervate visceral organs."
"The ventral root axons join with the peripheral processes of the dorsal root ganglion cells to form mixed afferent and efferent spinal nerves, which merge to form peripheral nerves. Knowledge of the segmental innervation of the cutaneous area and the muscles is essential to diagnose the site of an injury. A transverse section of the adult spinal cord shows white matter in the periphery, gray matter inside, and a tiny central canal filled with CSF at its center."
"Surrounding the canal is a single layer of cells, the ependymal layer. Surrounding the ependymal layer is the gray matter – a region containing cell bodies – shaped like the letter “H” or a “butterfly”. The two “wings” of the butterfly are connected across the midline by the dorsal gray commissure and below the white commissure ."
"The shape and size of the gray matter varies according to spinal cord level. At the lower levels, the ratio between gray matter and white matter is greater than in higher levels, mainly because lower levels contain less ascending and descending nerve fibers. ."
"The gray matter mainly contains the cell bodies of neurons and glia and is divided into four main columns: dorsal horn, intermediate column, lateral horn and ventral horn column. . The dorsal horn is found at all spinal cord levels and is comprised of sensory nuclei that receive and process incoming somatosensory information."
"From there, ascending projections emerge to transmit the sensory information to the midbrain and diencephalon. The intermediate column and the lateral horn comprise autonomic neurons innervating visceral and pelvic organs. The ventral horn comprises motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscle."
"At all the levels of the spinal cord, nerve cells in the gray substance are multipolar, varying much in their morphology. Many of them are Golgi type I and Golgi type II nerve cells. The axons of Golgi type I are long and pass out of the gray matter into the ventral spinal roots or the fiber tracts of the white matter."
"The axons and dendrites of the Golgi type II cells are largely confined to the neighboring neurons in the gray matter. A more recent classification of neurons within the gray matter is based on function. These cells are located at all levels of the spinal cord and are grouped into three main categories: root cells, column or tract cells and propriospinal cells."
"The root cells are situated in the ventral and lateral gray horns and vary greatly in size. The most prominent features of the root cells are large multipolar elements exceeding 25 µm of their somata. The root cells contribute their axons to the ventral roots of the spinal nerves and are grouped into two major divisions: 1) somatic efferent root neurons, which innervate the skeletal musculature; and 2) the visceral efferent root neurons, also called preganglionic autonomic axons, which send their axons to various autonomic ganglia."
"The column or tract cells and their processes are located mainly in the dorsal gray horn and are confined entirely within the CNS. The axons of the column cells form longitudinal ascending tracts that ascend in the white columns and terminate upon neurons located rostrally in the brain stem, cerebellum or diencephalon. Some column cells send their axons up and down the cord to terminate in gray matter close to their origin and are known as intersegmental association column cells."
Other column cell axons terminate within the segment in which they originate and are called intrasegmental association column cells. Still other column cells send their axons across the midline to terminate in gray matter close to their origin and are called commissure association column cells. The propriospinal cells are spinal interneurons whose axons do not leave the spinal cord proper.
Propriospinal cells account for about 90% of spinal neurons. Some of these fibers also are found around the margin of the gray matter of the cord and are collectively called the fasciculus proprius or the propriospinal or the archispinothalamic tract. Spinal neurons are organized into nuclei and laminae.
"The prominent nuclear groups of cell columns within the spinal cord from dorsal to ventral are the marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa, nucleus proprius, dorsal nucleus of Clarke, intermediolateral nucleus and the lower motor neuron nuclei. Marginal zone nucleus or posterior marginalis, is found at all spinal cord levels as a thin layer of column/tract cells  that caps the tip of the dorsal horn. The axons of its neurons contribute to the lateral spinothalamic tract which relays pain and temperature information to the diencephalon ."
"Substantia gelatinosa is found at all levels of the spinal cord. Located in the dorsal cap-like portion of the head of the dorsal horn, it relays pain, temperature and mechanical  information and consists mainly of column cells . These column cells synapse in cell at Rexed layers IV to VII, whose axons contribute to the ventral  and lateral spinal thalamic tracts."
"The homologous substantia gelatinosa in the medulla is the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Nucleus proprius is located below the substantia gelatinosa in the head and neck of the dorsal horn. This cell group, sometimes called the chief sensory nucleus, is associated with mechanical and temperature sensations."
"It is a poorly defined cell column which extends through all segments of the spinal cord and its neurons contribute to ventral and lateral spinal thalamic tracts, as well as to spinal cerebellar tracts. The axons originating in nucleus proprius project to the thalamus via the spinothalamic tract and to the cerebellum via the ventral spinocerebellar tract . Dorsal nucleus of Clarke is a cell column located in the mid-portion of the base form of the dorsal horn."
"The axons from these cells pass uncrossed to the lateral funiculus and form the dorsal  spinocerebellar tract , which subserve unconscious proprioception from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs to the cerebellum, and some of them innervate spinal interneurons. The dorsal nucleus of Clarke is found only in segments C8 to L3 of the spinal cord and is most prominent in lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments. The homologous dorsal nucleus of Clarke in the medulla is the accessory cuneate nucleus, which is the origin of the cuneocerebellar tract ."
"Intermediolateral nucleus is located in the intermediate zone between the dorsal and the ventral horns in the spinal cord levels. Extending from C8 to L3, it receives viscerosensory information and contains preganglionic sympathetic neurons, which form the lateral horn. A large proportion of its cells are root cells which send axons into the ventral spinal roots via the white rami to reach the sympathetic tract as preganglionic fibers."
"Similarly, cell columns in the intermediolateral nucleus located at the S2 to S4 levels contains preganglionic parasympathetic neurons . Lower motor neuron nuclei are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. They contain predominantly motor nuclei consisting of α, β and γ motor neurons and are found at all levels of the spinal cord--they are root cells."
"The a motor neurons are the final common pathway of the motor system, and they innervate the visceral and skeletal muscles. The distribution of cells and fibers within the gray matter of the spinal cord exhibits a pattern of lamination. The cellular pattern of each lamina is composed of various sizes or shapes of neurons  which led Rexed to propose a new classification based on 10 layers ."
"This classification is useful since it is related more accurately to function than the previous classification scheme which was based on major nuclear groups . Laminae I to IV, in general, are concerned with exteroceptive sensation and comprise the dorsal horn, whereas laminae V and VI are concerned primarily with proprioceptive sensations. Lamina VII is equivalent to the intermediate zone and acts as a relay between muscle spindle to midbrain and cerebellum, and laminae VIII-IX comprise the ventral horn and contain mainly motor neurons."
The axons of these neurons innervate mainly skeletal muscle. Lamina X surrounds the central canal and contains neuroglia. Rexed lamina I – Consists of a thin layer of cells that cap the tip of the dorsal horn with small dendrites and a complex array of nonmyelinated axons.
Cells in lamina I respond mainly to noxious and thermal stimuli. Lamina I cell axons join the contralateral spinothalamic tract; this layer corresponds to nucleus posteromarginalis. Rexed lamina II – Composed of tightly packed interneurons.
This layer corresponds to the substantia gelatinosa and responds to noxious stimuli while others respond to non-noxious stimuli. The majority of neurons in Rexed lamina II axons receive information from sensory dorsal root ganglion cells as well as descending dorsolateral fasciculus  fibers. They send axons to Rexed laminae III and IV .
"High concentrations of substance P and opiate receptors have been identified in Rexed lamina II. The lamina is believed to be important for the modulation of sensory input, with the effect of determining which pattern of incoming information will produce sensations that will be interpreted by the brain as being painful. Rexed lamina III – Composed of variable cell size, axons of these neurons bifurcate several times and form a dense plexus."
"Cells in this layer receive axodendritic synapses from Aβ fibers entering dorsal root fibers. It contains dendrites of cells from laminae IV, V and VI. Most of the neurons in lamina III function as propriospinal/interneuron cells."
"Rexed lamina IV – The thickest of the first four laminae. Cells in this layer receive Aß axons which carry predominantly non-noxious information. In addition, dendrites of neurons in lamina IV radiate to lamina II, and respond to stimuli such as light touch."
The ill-defined nucleus proprius is located in the head of this layer. Some of the cells project to the thalamus via the contralateral and ipsilateral spinothalamic tract. Rexed lamina V – Composed neurons with their dendrites in lamina II.
"The neurons in this lamina receive monosynaptic information from Aß, Ad and C axons which also carry nociceptive information from visceral organs. This lamina covers a broad zone extending across the neck of the dorsal horn and is divided into medial and lateral parts. Many of the Rexed lamina V cells project to the brain stem and the thalamus via the contralateral and ipsilateral spinothalamic tract."
"Moreover, descending corticospinal and rubrospinal fibers synapse upon its cells. Rexed lamina VI – Is a broad layer which is best developed in the cervical and lumbar enlargements. Lamina VI divides also into medial and lateral parts."
"Group Ia afferent axons from muscle spindles terminate in the medial part at the C8 to L3 segmental levels and are the source of the ipsilateral spinocerebellar pathways. Many of the small neurons are interneurons participating in spinal reflexes, while descending brainstem pathways project to the lateral zone of Rexed layer VI. Rexed lamina VII – This lamina occupies a large heterogeneous region."
"This region is also known as the zona intermedia . Its shape and boundaries vary along the length of the cord. Lamina VII neurons receive information from Rexed lamina II to VI as well as visceral afferent fibers, and they serve as an intermediary relay in transmission of visceral motor neurons impulses."
"The dorsal nucleus of Clarke forms a prominent round oval cell column from C8 to L3. The large cells give rise to uncrossed nerve fibers of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract . Cells in laminae V to VII, which do not form a discrete nucleus, give rise to uncrossed fibers that form the ventral spinocerebellar tract ."
"Cells in the lateral horn of the cord in segments T1 and L3 give rise to preganglionic sympathetic fibers to innervate postganglionic cells located in the sympathetic ganglia outside the cord. Lateral horn neurons at segments S2 to S4 give rise to preganglionic neurons of the sacral parasympathetic fibers to innervate postganglionic cells located in peripheral ganglia. Rexed lamina VIII – Includes an area at the base of the ventral horn, but its shape differs at various cord levels."
"In the cord enlargements, the lamina occupies only the medial part of the ventral horn, where descending vestibulospinal and reticulospinal fibers terminate. The neurons of lamina VIII modulate motor activity, most probably via g motor neurons which innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers. Rexed lamina IX – Composed of several distinct groups of large a motor neurons and small γ and β motor neurons embedded within this layer."
"Its size and shape differ at various cord levels. In the cord enlargements the number of α motor neurons increase and they form numerous groups. The α motor neurons are large and multipolar cells and give rise to ventral root fibers to supply extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers, while the small γ motor neurons give rise to the intrafusal muscle fibers."
"The α motor neurons are somatotopically organized. Rexed lamina X – Neurons in Rexed lamina X surround the central canal and occupy the commissural lateral area of the gray commissure, which also contains decussating axons. In summary, laminae I-IV are concerned with exteroceptive sensations, whereas laminae V and VI are concerned primarily with proprioceptive sensation and act as a relay between the periphery to the midbrain and the cerebellum."
"Laminae VIII and IX form the final motor pathway to initiate and modulate motor activity via α, β and γ motor neurons, which innervate striated muscle. All visceral motor neurons are located in lamina VII and innervate neurons in autonomic ganglia. Surrounding the gray matter is white matter containing myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers."
"These fibers conduct information up  or down  the cord. The white matter is divided into the dorsal  column , lateral column and ventral  column . The anterior white commissure resides in the center of the spinal cord, and it contains crossing nerve fibers that belong to the spinothalamic tracts, spinocerebellar tracts, and anterior corticospinal tracts."
"Three general nerve fiber types can be distinguished in the spinal cord white matter: 1) long ascending nerve fibers originally from the column cells, which make synaptic connections to neurons in various brainstem nuclei, cerebellum and dorsal thalamus, 2) long descending nerve fibers originating from the cerebral cortex and various brainstem nuclei to synapse within the different Rexed layers in the spinal cord gray matter, and 3) shorter nerve fibers interconnecting various spinal cord levels such as the fibers responsible for the coordination of flexor reflexes. Ascending tracts are found in all columns whereas descending tracts are found only in the lateral and the anterior columns. Four different terms are often used to describe bundles of axons such as those found in the white matter: funiculus, fasciculus, tract, and pathway."
"Funiculus is a morphological term to describe a large group of nerve fibers which are located in a given area . Within a funiculus, groups of fibers from diverse origins, which share common features, are sometimes arranged in smaller bundles of axons called fasciculus, . Fasciculus is primarily a morphological term whereas tracts and pathways are also terms applied to nerve fiber bundles which have a functional connotation."
"A tract is a group of nerve fibers which usually has the same origin, destination, and course and also has similar functions. The tract name is derived from their origin and their termination . A pathway usually refers to the entire neuronal circuit responsible for a specific function, and it includes all the nuclei and tracts which are associated with that function."
"For example, the spinothalamic pathway includes the cell bodies of origin , their axons as they project through the dorsal roots, synapses in the spinal cord, and projections of second and third order neurons across the white commissure, which ascend to the thalamus in the spinothalamic tracts. The spinal cord white matter contains ascending and descending tracts. Ascending tracts ."
"The nerve fibers comprise the ascending tract emerge from the first order  neuron located in the dorsal root ganglion . The ascending tracts transmit sensory information from the sensory receptors to higher levels of the CNS. The ascending gracile and cuneate fasciculi occupying the dorsal column, and sometimes are named the dorsal funiculus."
"These fibers carry information related to tactile, two point discrimination of simultaneously applied pressure, vibration, position, and movement sense and conscious proprioception. In the lateral column , the neospinothalamic tract  is located more anteriorly and laterally, and carries pain, temperature and crude touch information from somatic and visceral structures. Nearby laterally, the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts carry unconscious proprioception information from muscles and joints of the lower extremity to the cerebellum."
"In the ventral column  there are four prominent tracts: 1) the paleospinothalamic tract  is located which carry pain, temperature, and information associated with touch to the brain stem nuclei and to the diencephalon, 2) the spinoolivary tract carries information from Golgi tendon organs to the cerebellum, 3) the spinoreticular tract, and 4) the spinotectal tract. Intersegmental nerve fibers traveling for several segments  and are located as a thin layer around the gray matter is known as fasciculus proprius, spinospinal or archispinothalamic tract. It carries pain information to the brain stem and diencephalon."
"Descending tracts . The descending tracts originate from different cortical areas and from brain stem nuclei. The descending pathway carry information associated with maintenance of motor activities such as posture, balance, muscle tone, and visceral and somatic reflex activity."
These include the lateral corticospinal tract and the rubrospinal tracts located in the lateral column . These tracts carry information associated with voluntary movement. Other tracts such as the reticulospinal vestibulospinal and the anterior corticospinal tract mediate balance and postural movements .
"Lissauer's tract, which is wedged between the dorsal horn and the surface of the spinal cord carry the descending fibers of the dorsolateral funiculus , which regulate incoming pain sensation at the spinal level, and intersegmental fibers. Additional details about ascending and descending tracts are described in the next few chapters. Information from the skin, skeletal muscle and joints is relayed to the spinal cord by sensory cells located in the dorsal root ganglia."
"The dorsal root fibers are the axons originated from the primary sensory dorsal root ganglion cells. Each ascending dorsal root axon, before reaching the spinal cord, bifurcates into ascending and descending branches entering several segments below and above their own segment. The ascending dorsal root fibers and the descending ventral root fibers from and to discrete body areas form a spinal nerve ."
"There are 31 paired spinal nerves. The dorsal root fibers segregate into lateral and medial divisions. The lateral division contains most of the unmyelinated and small myelinated axons carrying pain and temperature information to be terminated in the Rexed laminae I, II, and IV of the gray matter."
"The medial division of dorsal root fibers consists mainly of myelinated axons conducting sensory fibers from skin, muscles and joints; it enters the dorsal/posterior column/funiculus and ascend in the dorsal column to be terminated in the ipsilateral nucleus gracilis or nucleus cuneatus at the medulla oblongata region, i. e. , the axons of the first-order  sensory neurons synapse in the medulla oblongata on the second order  neurons ."
"In entering the spinal cord, all fibers send collaterals to different Rexed lamina. Axons entering the cord in the sacral region are found in the dorsal column near the midline and comprise the fasciculus gracilis, whereas axons that enter at higher levels are added in lateral positions and comprise the fasciculus cuneatus . This orderly representation is termed “somatotopic representation”."
"Ventral root fibers are the axons of motor and visceral efferent fibers and emerge from poorly defined ventral lateral sulcus as ventral rootlets. The ventral rootlets from discrete spinal cord section unite and form the ventral root, which contain motor nerve axons from motor and visceral motor neurons. The α motor nerve axons innervate the extrafusal muscle fibers while the small γ motor neuron axons innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers located within the muscle spindles."
"The visceral neurons send preganglionic fibers to innervate the visceral organs. All these fibers join the dorsal root fibers distal to the dorsal root ganglion to form the spinal nerve . The spinal nerve roots are formed by the union of dorsal and ventral roots within the intervertebral foramen, resulting in a mixed nerve joined together and forming the spinal nerve ."
"Spinal nerve rami include the dorsal primary nerves , which innervates the skin and muscles of the back, and the ventral primary nerves , which innervates the ventral lateral muscles and skin of the trunk, extremities and visceral organs. The ventral and dorsal roots also provide the anchorage and fixation of the spinal cord to the vertebral cauda. The arterial blood supply to the spinal cord in the upper cervical regions is derived from two branches of the vertebral arteries, the anterior spinal artery and the posterior spinal arteries ."
"At the level of medulla, the paired anterior spinal arteries join to form a single artery that lies in the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord. The posterior spinal arteries are paired and form an anastomotic chain over the posterior aspect of the spinal cord. A plexus of small arteries, the arterial vasocorona, on the surface of the cord constitutes an anastomotic connection between the anterior and posterior spinal arteries."
"This arrangement provides uninterrupted blood supplies along the entire length of the spinal cord. At spinal cord regions below upper cervical levels, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries narrow and form an anastomotic network with radicular arteries. The radicular arteries are branches of the cervical, trunk, intercostal & iliac arteries."
"The radicular arteries supply most of the lower levels of the spinal cord. There are approximately 6 to 8 pairs of radicular arteries supplying the anterior and posterior spinal cord . This chapter describes the general organization of somatosensory pathways and the anatomy of the somatosensory pathways involved in processing discriminative touch and proprioceptive information, and those involved with sharp pain and cool/cold information."
"Discriminative touch and proprioceptive information allow for the recognition of objects by touch, provide for a sense of our body image and is used for maintaining balance and posture. Sharp, pricking pain and cool/cold information allows for the detection and localization of potential tissue-damaging stimuli in a timely manner. Sensory pathways consist of the chain of neurons, from receptor organ to cerebral cortex, that are responsible for the perception of sensations."
"Within each somatosensory pathway,  The 1° afferent is a pseudounipolar neuron that has its cell body located in a peripheral  ganglion. It has a peripheral axon that forms or innervates somatosensory receptors and a central process that synapses with 2° afferent neuron in a spinal cord or brain stem nucleus. The 2° afferent may synapse with 3° afferent neurons in the spinal cord or may ascend the neuraxis to synapse with 3° afferent neurons in the thalamus."
There is a decussation  in each somatosensory pathway below the level of the thalamus. All somatosensory pathways include a thalamic nucleus. The thalamic neurons send their axons in the posterior limb of the internal capsule to end in the cerebral cortex.
"Most somatosensory pathways terminate in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex. Each somatosensory pathway is named after a major tract or nucleus in the pathway. In general, conscious perception of sensory stimuli requires the involvement of neurons in the thalamus and cerebral cortex."
"For example, electrical stimulation of a structure in pathways connecting muscle and joint receptors to the cerebellum  will not produce a sensation of limb movement, as these pathways do not include the thalamus or cortex. In contrast, electrical stimulation of a structure in the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway  may result in a sensation of limb movement, as this pathway includes the thalamus and terminates in the cerebral cortex. The morphology of the peripheral somatosensory axon is related to the receptor it innervates or forms and to the sensory information it carries ."
"The Group I and II 1° afferent axons, which form the muscle/tendon receptors and carry body proprioceptive information, have the largest diameter and the thickest myelin of all the somatosensory 1° afferent axons. The Type C 1° afferent axons, which form free nerve endings and carry dull pain, deep pain, crude touch or warm/hot information, are the smallest 1° afferent axons and are unmyelinated. The Type Aδ1° afferent axons, which form free nerve endings and carry sharp pain or cool/cold information, are thinly myelinated and larger than the Type C axons."
"The Type Aβ 1° afferent axons, which form encapsulated endings in skin and joints or hair follicle endings or Merkel disks in skin, are myelinated and have diameter less than Group I afferents and greater than the Type Aδ 1° afferent axons. The morphology of the peripheral somatosensory axon is also related to the conduction velocity of the action potentials generated by the axon. The conduction velocity of an axon is determined by electrically stimulating the axon and recording the time  it takes the electrically elicited action potential to reach a recording electrode ."
"The distance traveled from the electrical stimulating site to the recording site divided by the latency provides the conduction velocity of the axon. As discussed in earlier chapters, the larger and more heavily myelinated the axon, the greater its conduction velocity . Consequently, the 1° afferent axons carrying information required for fine motor control and rapid reflex responses  conduct action potentials rapidly, whereas those carrying information about body and object temperature conduct action potentials at a much slower rate."
"The whole nerve potential or compound action potential  is recorded extracellularly from an electrically stimulated nerve and is the sum of the signals produced by each of the individual action potentials of the axons forming the nerve. The mixed nerve  compound action potential has three prominent peaks that are called A, B and C. The conduction velocity of an axon determines the axon's contribution to the compound action potential peaks."
"Specifically, the faster the axon conduction velocity, the shorter the latency of axon response and the greater the axon's contribution to the shorter latency peaks . The axons contributing to a given compound action potential peak  are named according to the peak name . When the relative amplitudes of the peaks differ from those generated by ""normal"" nerves, the types of damaged axons can be assessed by determining which peaks are abnormal."
"Consequently, the compound action potential is used clinically to detect nerve damage and to monitor the progress of the regeneration of damaged nerves. For historical reasons, the terminology based on axon conduction velocity  is used for afferent and efferent axons innervating muscles and tendons. And the terminology based on the compound action potential  is used for afferent axons innervating the skin, joints and viscera."
"Note that the fastest conducting somatosensory 1° afferents  innervate skeletal muscle and the slowest  form the receptors of the pain systems. While one might expect painful, tissue damaging stimuli to have priority over all other somatosensory stimuli, the afferent information required to control the reaction to the painful stimuli are conveyed by the faster conducting muscle and joint afferents. Even afferents providing more exact information about the location of a cutaneous stimulus, the Aβ axons, conduct at a faster rate than the Aδ and C axons carrying information about painful stimuli."
"Somatosensory neurons are topographically  organized so that adjacent neurons represent neighboring regions of the body or face . This organization is preserved by a precise point-to-point somatotopic pattern of connections from the spinal cord and brain stem to the thalamus and cortex. Consequently, within each somatosensory pathway there is a complete map  of the body or face in each of the somatosensory nuclei, tracts, and cortex."
"Additional information on somatotopic organization is presented in Chapter 5 of Section II. The sensory information processed by the somatosensory systems travels along different anatomical pathways depending on the information carried. For example, the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway carries discriminative touch and proprioceptive information from the body, and the main sensory trigeminal pathway carries this information from the face."
"Whereas, the spinothalamic pathways carry crude touch, pain and temperature information from the body, and the spinal trigeminal pathway carries this information from the face. The posterior  column - medial lemniscal pathway  carries and processes discriminative touch and proprioceptive information from the body . It is important to keep in mind that within the medial lemniscal pathway, the afferents carrying discriminative touch information are kept separate from those carrying proprioceptive information up to the level of the cerebral cortex."
"The peripheral axons of the 1° afferents are myelinated, large or medium diameter axons. Each axon travels via a posterior root, spinal nerve and peripheral nerve to skin, muscle or joint- where it forms or innervates a somatosensory receptor. The 1° medial lemniscal afferent peripheral process that end in the  skin, are Aβ axons that branch to innervate hair follicles or Merkel’s cells or form Meissner, Pacinian or Ruffini corpuscles."
"joints, are Aβ axons that branch to form encapsulated endings similar to the Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles and Golgi tendon organs. muscle, are Group I and II axons that branch to terminate in muscle spindles  or Golgi tendon organs . The 1° medial lemniscal afferent central axons  join a posterior root, enters the spinal cord, and ascends to the brain stem in the posterior column of the spinal cord ."
of coccygeal to mid-thoracic posterior roots  ascend the spinal cord in the ipsilateral gracile fasciculus. of the upper thoracic  and cervical roots collect in the ipsilateral cuneate fasciculus. of the gracile and cuneate fasciculi are collectively called the posterior funiculus or posterior column.
"ascends the spinal cord in the posterior funiculus up to the medulla without synapsing or decussating . In the medulla,  the 1° afferents in the gracile fasciculus synapse in the gracile nucleus the 1° afferents in the cuneate fasciculus synapse in the cuneate nucleus. the axons of the gracile and cuneate nuclei  pass anteriorly and decussate to form the medial lemniscus, contralateral to their cells of origin."
"above the level of the gracile and cuneate nuclei, each half of the body is represented contralaterally  within the medial lemniscal pathway. The 2° medial lemniscal afferents  ascend the brain stem in the medial lemniscus to the diencephalon. terminate in the ventral posterolateral  nucleus of the thalamus."
carrying cutaneous information terminate in the core of the VPL. carrying proprioceptive information terminate in the surrounding shell of the VPL. The axons of the VPL 3° afferent neurons  travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
terminate in the postcentral gyrus and posterior paracentral lobule of the parietal lobe. The postcentral gyrus and posterior paracentral lobule  are called the primary somatosensory cortex. are the primary cortical receiving areas of the somatosensory system.
"The lower part of the body  are represented in the posterior paracentral lobule, whereas the upper body  are represented in the upper postcentral gyrus . The action potentials ascend the spinal cord via the central process of the 1° afferent in the fasciculus gracilis of the posterior column until they reach the medulla. In the medulla, the action potentials initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 1° afferent axon terminals onto 2° afferents within the gracile nucleus."
"The 2° afferent generates action potentials that are conducted by its axons, which decussate to form the medial lemniscus. These action potentials are conducted by the 2° afferent axon contralateral to their site of origin and contralateral to the foot where the stimulus was applied. The action potentials ascend to the thalamus where they initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 2° afferent axon terminals."
"They release neurotransmitters onto the 3° afferents in the core of the VPL of the thalamus. The action potentials generated by the 3° VPL afferents are conducted by their axons, which travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, to the posterior paracentral lobule of the parietal cortex. These action potentials initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 3° afferent axon terminals onto cortical neurons and initiate the higher-order processing of the stimulus information generated by the Meissner corpuscle."
"The point-to-point connections within the pathway provide the basis for a somatotopic map that is used to locate the area of contact with the stimulus and for modality specific information used to identify the stimulus as tactile and from a Meissner corpuscle. The main sensory trigeminal pathway carries and processes discriminative touch and proprioceptive information from the face . Consequently, it is the cranial homologue of the medial lemniscal pathway."
"The cranial 1° main sensory trigeminal afferent neurons  peripheral processes are located in the trigeminal , facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. form mechanoreceptors in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles and joints of the face. The relationship between receptor type formed and the axon Type/Group are similar to those of the medial lemniscal 1° afferents."
"have pseudounipolar cell bodies in the cranial ganglia of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves . send their central axons to the brain stem. synapse in the main sensory trigeminal nucleus ."
"The main sensory trigeminal 2° afferent axons  decussate immediately on leaving the main sensory trigeminal nucleus. join the contralateral ventral trigeminal lemniscus. above the level of the main sensory trigeminal nucleus , carries information about the contralateral face ."
The 2° main sensory trigeminal afferents in the ventral trigeminal lemniscus  ascend to the diencephalon. terminate in the ventral posteromedial  nucleus of the thalamus. The axons of the 3° main sensory trigeminal afferents   travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
end in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. The postcentral gyrus  is part of the primary cortical receiving area of the somatosensory system. The face is represented in the lower half of the postcentral gyrus .
"Figure 4,8 illustrates the course of action potentials generated in response to touching the left cheek with a wisp of cotton. A Merkel receptor in the left cheek is stimulated, and its 1° afferent generates action potentials that are conducted by the 1° afferent Ab axon, past its pseudounipolar soma, into the brain stem. The 1° afferent central process conducts the action potentials into the pons where they initiate the release neurotransmitter from the 1° afferent axon terminals."
"The neurotransmitter is released onto 2° afferents within the main sensory trigeminal nucleus. The 2° afferent generates action potentials that are conducted along its axon, which decussates in the pons to join the ventral trigeminal lemniscus. These action potentials are conducted by the 2° afferent axon contralateral to their site of origin and contralateral to the site where the stimulus was applied."
"The action potentials ascend to the thalamus where they initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 2° afferent axon terminals. They release neurotransmitters onto the 3° afferents in the core of the VPM of the thalamus. The action potentials generated by the 3° VPM afferents are conducted by their axons, which travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal cortex."
These action potentials initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 3° afferent axon terminals onto cortical neurons and initiate the higher-order processing of the stimulus information generated by the Merkel cell. The point-to-point connections within the pathway provide the basis for a somatotopic map that is used to locate the area of contact with the stimulus and for modality specific information used to identify the stimulus as tactile and from a Merkel cell. There is a minor proprioceptive component for the jaw in cranial nerve V that has 1° afferent cell bodies located in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus.
The peripheral axons of these afferents travel in the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and end in the jaw muscles and joint. The central processes of most of these afferents end in the trigeminal motor nucleus that controls the muscles of the jaw. Few synapse in the main sensory trigeminal nucleus.
"The neospinothalamic pathway carries and processes sharp, pricking pain and dropping temperature  information from the body . The pain information carried by the neospinothalamic pathway is well localized and the sensations are the short lasting “fast” or “first” pain elicited by tissue-damaging cutaneous stimuli. The neospinothalamic pathway is also characterized by somatotopic representation, which allows for accurate localization of the painful stimulus."
"Recall that there are multiple spinal pathways processing pain information . Most of the ascending afferents of the spinal pain pathways travel with the neospinothalamic afferents in a fiber tract called the ""spinothalamic tract"" or ""anterolateral spinothalamic tract"". Elements of these other pain pathways will be mentioned below to help you understand how pain sensations may remain after damage to the neospinothalamic pathway."
"The pain pathways will be covered in greater detail in later chapters. The 1° neospinothalamic afferents  have Type Aδ peripheral axons that form free nerve endings in skin, muscles and joints. have central processes that enter the spinal cord."
synapse in the posterior marginal nucleus  of the posterior horn. The 2° neospinothalamic afferent axons  decussate in the spinal cord anterior white commissure. form the lateral part of the spinothalamic tract in the lateral funiculus.
Note that the fibers in the lateral spinothalamic tract are contralateral to their cells of origin and contralateral to the body area they represent. The crossed 2° neospinothalamic afferent axons  ascend the spinal cord and brain stem as part of the spinothalamic tract. travel with other pain  afferents that leave the spinothalamic tract and terminate in the brain stem as: spinoreticular fibers that end in the reticular formation of the brain stem.
spinomesencephalic fibers that end near the periaqueductal gray of the midbrain. travel with other pain  afferents to the diencephalon where the neospinothalamic afferents terminate in the ventral posterolateral  nucleus of the thalamus. the paleospinothalamic afferents terminate in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus.
The spinothalamic afferent axons from the thalamus  travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. VPL  end in the postcentral gyrus and posterior paracentral lobule of the parietal lobe. Intralaminar nuclei  end in the insula and rostral cingulate gyrus.
"The postcentral gyrus and posterior paracentral lobule are  the neospinothalamic pathway termination sites. the primary cortical receiving areas for sharp, cutting pain information. not the exclusive cortical receiving area for pain information."
"The insula and rostral cingulate gyrus  are the archispinothalamic and paleospinothalamic pathways' termination sites. receive dull and deep pain information. are responsible for poorly localized, longer lasting pain sensations and add the emotional  features to these sensations."
"The action potentials enter the spinal cord via the central process of the 1° afferents to initiate the release neurotransmitter from the 1° afferent axon terminals onto 2° afferents within the posterior marginal nucleus. The 2° afferent generates action potentials that are conducted by its axon, which decussates in the anterior white commissure of the spinal cord. The crossed 2° neospinothalamic afferent axons form the lateral component of the spinothalamic tract."
The action potentials conducted by the crossed 2° afferent axon are contralateral to their site of origin and contralateral to the foot where the stimulus was applied. The action potentials ascend to the thalamus where they initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 2° afferent axon terminals. They release neurotransmitters onto the 3° afferents in the VPL of the thalamus.
"The action potentials generated by the 3° VPL afferents are conducted by their axons, which travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, to the posterior paracentral lobule of the parietal cortex. These action potentials initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 3° afferent axon terminals onto cortical neurons and initiate the higher-order processing of the stimulus information generated by the free nerve ending. The point-to-point connections within the pathway provide the basis for a somatotopic map that is used to locate the area of contact with the stimulus and for modality specific information used to identify the stimulus as a sharp pinprick."
"The spinal trigeminal pathway carries and processes crude touch, pain and temperature information from the face  Consequently, it is the cranial homologue of the spinothalamic pathways i. e. , homologous to all the spinothalamic pathways, the archi-, paleo- and neospinothalamic pathways."
"As in the spinothalamic pathways, the afferents carrying crude touch information are kept separate from those carrying temperature information and from others carrying pain information. Also the trigeminal afferents carrying sharp, cutting pain information are segregated from those carrying dull, burning pain and deep aching pain information. The 1° spinal trigeminal afferents  are located in the same nerves and ganglia as those of the main sensory trigeminal pathway ."
"have Aδ and C peripheral axons that form free nerve endings in the dura and face. on entering the brain stem, form the spinal trigeminal tract. The spinal trigeminal tract  extends from mid pontine levels  down to C1 of the spinal cord."
consists of spinal trigeminal 1° afferent axons . 1° afferents synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus . The 2° spinal trigeminal afferent axons  decussate and form the ventral trigeminal lemniscus contralateral to their cells of origin.
"ascend in the ventral trigeminal lemniscus as crossed 2° spinal trigeminal afferents. travel with afferents that leave the ventral trigeminal lemniscus as trigeminoreticular fibers, which terminate in the brain stem reticular formation. are joined by the crossed 2° main sensory trigeminal afferents at mid-pons."
"travel with afferents that leave the ventral trigeminal lemniscus as trigeminomesencephalic fibers, which terminate near the midbrain periaqueductal gray. terminate in the VPM and in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. Multiple thalamic nuclei process information in this pathway  the VPM processes sharp pricking pain."
"the intralaminar nuclei processes other poorly localized sensations of dull, burning pain, deep, aching pain, temperature and crude touch. The 3° spinal trigeminal afferent axons from the thalamus:  travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. end in multiple areas of the cerebral cortex."
"The spinal trigeminal pathway terminates in multiple cortical areas:  the 3° VPM axons end in the primary somatosensory cortex , which provides for accurate localization in the face area of the source of the sharp, pricking pain. the intralaminar nuclei axons terminate in the cingulate gyrus and insula of the cerebral cortex, which provide for poorly localized sensations of dull and aching pain, temperature and crude touch. The 1° afferent central process bypasses the main sensory trigeminal nucleus and descends the brain stem in the spinal trigeminal tract."
"The action potentials are conducted in this descending tract to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, where they initiate the release neurotransmitter from the 1° afferent axon terminals. The neurotransmitter is released onto 2° afferents within the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The 2° afferent generates action potentials that are conducted along its axon, which decussates to form the ventral trigeminal lemniscus."
These action potentials are conducted by the 2° afferent axon contralateral to their site of origin and contralateral to the cheek where the stimulus was applied. The action potentials ascend to the thalamus where they initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 2° afferent axon terminals. They release neurotransmitters onto the 3° afferents in the VPM.
"The action potentials generated by the 3° VPM afferents are conducted by their axons, which travel in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal cortex. These action potentials initiate the release of neurotransmitter from the 3° afferent axon terminals onto cortical neurons and initiate the higher-order processing of the stimulus information generated by the free nerve ending. The point-to-point connections within the pathway provide the basis for a somatotopic map that is used to locate the area of contact with the stimulus and for modality specific information used to identify the stimulus as a sharp pinprick."
"Clinically, it is important to remember what information is carried by a particular pathway and the level of the pathway at which decussation occurs . For example, if the posterior funiculus were sectioned, sparing the rest of the spinal cord, discriminative touch and proprioception would be affected but not pain, temperature, or crude touch. Also, the loss of discriminative touch and proprioception would be ipsilesional  because the 1° afferent axons in the posterior columns do not decussate."
"Consequently, damage to the posterior column in the spinal cord would be suspected if a patient presented with a loss of discriminative touch and proprioception in the right leg and foot, with no change in pain or temperature sense in the body or face. This area of loss resulted because the ascending medial lemniscal 1° afferent axons from coccygeal to lower thoracic levels were cut off from the brain stem, and the information they carried could not be sent on to the thalamus and cortex. In contrast, a stroke affecting the posterior paracentral lobule would produce sensory deficits in discriminative touch, proprioception and sharp pricking pain contralateral to the site of stroke."
"However such a stroke would affect other pain, temperature and crude touch sensations less than a large spinal cord lesion because these somatic sensations are represented in diffuse areas of the cortex. Previous chapters described the ways in which the different somatosensory receptors respond to specific types of somatosensory stimuli and that the receptors, by virtue of their selective sensitivities, extract specific information about the somatosensory stimulus. The specificity of the receptors forms the basis for a parsing  of somatosensory experience into separate “information channels” or pathways."
"For example, sharp-pricking pain is mediated in the neospinothalamic  pathway, whereas proprioception is mediated in the medial lemniscus pathway. Recall that the receptor's extraction of somatosensory information is very specific  and the processing of this extracted information is kept separate along most of the ascending pathway. In addition to this parsing of stimulus information, the somatosensory system is also organized to provide a somatotopic representation of the body surface and parts."
"The resulting spatial maps provide the anatomical basis for our ability to localize somatosensory stimuli and for our sense of a 'body image"". As described above, the nervous system reduces somatosensory experience into parallel streams of neural activity - a decomposition of the experience into stimulus fragments spread over body pieces. So how does one have a sense of ""oneness"" of the body and how does one identify an object by handling it?"
One can do so because somatosensory information converges in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex to provide a cohesive perception of the body and of somatosensory stimuli. The first part of this chapter will present additional details about the general organization of the somatosensory system and how somatosensory information is represented and processed in the parietal cortex. This understanding of the general organization of the somatosensory pathways will be used in the clinical assessments of somatosensory function.
"In each of the somatosensory pathways covered thus far, afferent axons decussate  once on their course to the thalamus . Above the level of decussation, the neurons in a somatosensory pathway represent the contralateral  side of the body or face. It is important to learn the decussation site, as it will aid in clinical diagnosis."
"When an afferent pathway is damaged somewhere below the site of decussation, the sensory loss will be on the side ipsilateral to the lesion . When an afferent pathway is damaged somewhere above the site of decussation, the sensory loss will be on the side contralateral to the lesion . In the medial lemniscal pathway, the axons of the gracile and cuneate nuclei decussate in the medulla."
"The decussation in the neospinothalamic pathway is in the spinal cord and involves the axons of the posterior marginal nucleus. The spinal trigeminal nucleus axons decussate upon leaving the nucleus in the medulla and lower pons, whereas the main sensory trigeminal nucleus axons decussate at mid pons levels immediately upon leaving the nucleus. The sensory information necessary for discriminative touch, proprioception, pain and thermal sensations are kept separate within the somatosensory pathways ."
"To ensure the fidelity of stimulus representation in the discriminative touch-proprioceptive pathways, there is minimal convergence of modality specific information along the pathways. That is, within the medial lemniscal and main sensory trigeminal pathways, there is little mixing of information from different receptor types and from afferents with different adaptive properties up to the level of the cerebral cortex. For example, a cuneate nucleus neuron  will synapse only with one type of posterior root neuron ."
"Within VPL and VPM, the medial lemniscal and ventral trigeminal lemniscal fibers terminate in different regions based on the sensory information they are carrying. Fibers carrying cutaneous information terminate within the core of the nucleus, whereas those carrying proprioceptive information terminate in the surrounding, peripheral shell of the nucleus. Within the cerebral cortex, there is a convergence of modality specific information and the response properties of cortical neurons become more complex."
"The primary somatosensory cortex is responsible for the first stage of cortical processing. Within the primary sensory cortex, discriminative touch and proprioceptive information from overlapping areas may be combined such that a cortical neuron may respond to both cutaneous and proprioceptive stimulation of a digit. Each subcortical somatosensory neuron responds to modality-specific stimuli applied to a specific region of the body or face."
"For example, an axon in the medial lemniscus  that responds to tactile stimulation of the right index finger pad will not respond to tactile stimulation of any other area in the hand, body or face. The stimulated area producing the response is called the neuron’s receptive field . The neuron’s receptive field can also be defined anatomically as that area of the sense organ  innervated directly or indirectly by the neuron."
"Consequently, a somatosensory neuron can be described to channel information about stimulus location - as well as stimulus modality. Furthermore, the size of a neuron’s receptive field is related to the body area innervated/represented. The receptive fields of neurons innervating/representing the finger pads, lips, and tongue are the smallest, whereas those of neurons innervating/representing the shoulders, back and legs are the largest."
"For greater accuracy in locating the point of stimulus contact or movement, smaller cutaneous receptive fields are required. For fine motor control, as in playing the piano or speaking, small proprioceptive receptive fields are required. Within each somatosensory structure, neurons are organized to provide a spatial representation of the body and face called the somatotopic map ."
"That is, within the spinal cord, brain stem, thalamus and postcentral gyrus, the location of a neuron is related to its receptive field. Consequently, body and face  are represented spatially  within nuclei and cortex such that, neurons with contiguous receptive fields are located adjacent to one another within a given structure. For example, adjoining areas of the body are represented in adjoining areas of the cortex ."
"The resulting neural maps of the body and face are not isomorphic representations and appear distorted because of the disproportionate representation of the hand and face areas . That is, as the neurons representing the hand and face have small receptive fields , a greater number of neurons are required to represent the hand and face. Because somatosensory neurons represent specific stimulus features and specific areas of the body or face, electrical stimulation of a restricted area of the postcentral gyrus  will produce a somatic  sensation that is perceived as arising from the specific region of the body ."
"Somatosensory information converges in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex where it is processed to provide a cohesive perception of your body and your physical environment. The primary somatosensory cortex, SI, includes the postcentral gyrus and the posterior paracentral lobule of the parietal lobe . SI extends from the depths of the central sulcus up superiorly to form the posterior lip of the central sulcus."
"SI is considered the primary somatosensory cortex because it is the major site of termination of VPL and VPM axons:  its neurons are responsive to somatosensory stimuli almost exclusively; lesions of SI produce severe somatosensory deficits; and electrical stimulation of SI produces somatosensory perceptions. SI is somatotopically organized. The body and face are mapped in the contralateral cortex with the foot and leg represented in the posterior paracentral lobule and the trunk, chest, arm and hand in the upper half of the postcentral gyrus."
"The face is represented in the lower half of the postcentral gyrus . Differential projections to the SI areas arise from the central core and shell of VPM and VPL. However, there is also convergence of somatotopic and modality specific information in SI."
"To appreciate the shape, texture, size, weight, and movement of a given object, the somatosensory cortex must integrate the parallel streams of information carried by the medial lemniscal pathway. To achieve this integration, the parallel streams converge at cortical levels, starting in SI. As a result of this convergence, receptive fields become larger, modality specificity diminishes, and the cortical neural responses become more complex."
"SI neurons send their axons to the secondary somatosensory cortex, adjacent areas of the parietal lobe, and to cortical motor areas  as well as to subcortical nuclei, brain stem and spinal cord. Unilateral destruction of SI produces severe deficits in all aspects of discriminative touch and proprioception on the contralesional side of the body. In addition to deficits in the abilities to accurately localize and to recognize objects by shape, texture and size and to appreciate vibrating/moving stimuli, there are deficits in fine motor coordination."
"The secondary somatosensory cortex, SII, is located inferiorly - in the pars opercularis of the parietal lobe, which forms part of upper lip of the lateral sulcus . SII neurons send their axons to SI, association cortex, motor cortex, and insula . The latter projection, to the insula, influences structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus."
"These structures are important in tactile learning and memory. The projection to the somatosensory association cortex is involved in higher order processing required for recognizing hand-held objects by texture and size. Consequently, lesions in SII produce deficits in learning by object manipulation and in recognizing the texture and size of hand-held objects."
"The somatosensory association cortex is located in the superior parietal lobe , which is posterior to SI. The highest degree of convergence of somatosensory information occurs in the posterior parietal cortex. The posterior parietal cortex receives the axons of SI and SII neurons and also receives input from the visual system and other systems involved in attention and motivation."
"Neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are responsive to somatosensory and visual stimuli, have large somatic receptive fields in which responsiveness is based on stimulus context, and are often more responsive to stimulus movement. Large lesions involving the posterior parietal cortex and the adjoining superior temporal gyrus may result in an attentional deficit called “neglect”, wherein there is a partial neglect  to tactile, proprioceptive and/or visual stimuli delivered contralateral to the lesion site. The patient is described as ignoring the contralesional half of her/his body and space."
"The perception of a ""whole"" body is lost and the body parts affected may be considered to belong to someone else. Visual stimuli on the contralesional side may also be ignored. Pain information is processed in multiple pathways  involving multiple thalamic nuclei that project to multiple cortical areas."
"In addition to the somatosensory cortex, painful stimuli activate neurons in the rostral cingulate gyrus and the insula. Consequently, all pain sensation is not lost when the primary somatosensory cortex is damaged. Primary somatosensory cortex neurons that have small receptive fields and are selectively responsive to sharp, cutting painful stimuli are considered to provide the ability to accurately localize the exact point of contact with the painful stimulus."
Lesions of the primary somatosensory cortex will affect the quality of pain sensations and the ability to localize the exact location of the painful stimulus. An excellent way to test your knowledge of the material presented thus far is by examining the effects of damage to structures within the somatosensory pathways. The observed sensory loss provide clues to the pathway affected; and the area and side of the body/face affected provide clues to the level of the damage.
"The following section should help you determine how well you can utilize what you have learned thus far about the somatosensory system. Peripheral Nerve Damage: Damage to peripheral nerves often results in sensory and motor symptoms. The sensory losses would include all somatosensory sensations if the peripheral nerve contains all the afferent axons supplying the skin, muscles and joints of a given body part ."
The motor losses may be severe  if the peripheral nerve contains all of the motor axons controlling the muscles of the normally innervated body part. Damage to peripheral nerves results in a loss of all somatosensory modalities and motor function in a restricted area of the body defined by the nerve distribution. Electrophysiological methods can be used to determine the nerves involved and the degree of nerve damage .
"Posterior or Cranial Nerve Root Damage: The central processes of the 1° somatosensory afferents collect to form a posterior root prior to entering the spinal cord. Consequently, the area of the body supplied by a single posterior root is represented by the sum of receptive fields of the 1° afferents in the root. The area of the body innervated by a posterior root is called a dermatome ."
"Posterior root damage would result in somatosensory losses in the dermatome supplied by the root. All sensations would be lost in the central area of the dermatome. The more peripheral areas of the dermatome will have some sensation, albeit less than normal, as consecutive roots have partially overlapping dermatomes."
"The symptoms produced by cranial nerve root damage depend upon the cranial nerve involved. For example, the trigeminal nerve root contains somatosensory  and chemosensory  1° afferent axons innervating the face, as well as efferent  axons controlling the jaw muscles . Symptoms."
"The patient complains of a loss of sensation along the side of his left arm that extends down to include the thumb of his left hand . Physical examination determines that there are decreases in the abilities to detect vibration and position involving the left elbow and thumb and loss of touch and pain sensations along the lateral edge of the left arm down to the thumb. Touch, vibration, position, and pain sensations are normal for the rest of the body and face."
"Section of a Posterior Root results in the loss of all somatosensory modalities in a restricted area of the body defined by the root dermatome . Consequently, the damaged posterior root can be identified by the dermatomal pattern of sensory loss. Radiographic methods can be used to determine if the roots are being compressed by abnormalities in the vertebra."
"Spinal Cord Damage: Although there are numerous tracts in the spinal cord, the tracts considered to be of major clinical importance are limited. There are three major ascending tracts in the spinal cord, the posterior funiculus ; the spinothalamic tract ; and the posterior spinocerebellar tract . Clinical symptoms of spinal cord damage are obvious when the posterior columns and/or spinothalamic tract are affected."
"The posterior spinocerebellar tract carries unconscious proprioceptive information and damage to it does not result in sensory losses. When a somatosensory tract is sectioned in the spinal cord, the sensory losses start at the level of the lesion and extend down to encompass lower parts of the body. Such a loss occurs because the flow of ascending afferent information from the lesion site and lower body is interrupted and cannot reach the thalamus and cerebral cortex."
"The spinothalamic tracts are crossed in the spinal cord. The decussation in the medial lemniscal pathway occurs in the lower medulla. The cranial nerves, which are associated with the brain stem, supply the motor and sensory innervation of the face."
"Consequently, spinal cord lesions do not produce sensory or motor losses involving the face. When somatosensory losses are isolated to the body, spinal cord lesions should be suspected. Unilateral lesion of one descending tract, the corticospinal tract in the lateral funiculus, produces the most obvious motor deficits ."
"Symptoms: The patient complains of problems with walking, especially at night when there is little light. He also reports a loss of sensation in his right foot. Physical examination determines that there are decreases in vibration and position sensations and poor localization of tactile stimuli involving the right half of his body starting just below the right nipple and extending down to include his right foot ."
"Pain sensation is normal in the right torso, leg and foot. Touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal for the rest of the body and face. The Romberg test is positive."
"When only the posterior column of the spinal cord is damaged, there are losses involving discriminative touch and proprioception, but no loss of pain, temperature or crude touch sensitivity. The deficit is ipsilesional and extends down the body from the level of the lesion. There is an inability to appreciate vibrating stimuli and the position and movement in the ipsilesional lower body."
The remaining tactile sense in the ipsilesional lower body is poorly localized as the spinothalamic tracts are undamaged. The Romberg test is positive as the patient has lost proprioception in a leg and cannot maintain normal posture with eyes closed. Symptoms: The patient presents with a complaint of repeatedly injuring his left foot.
"Physical examination determines that there are losses of pain and temperature sensations involving the left half of his body starting just below the left nipple and extending down to include his left foot . However, discriminative touch, and position sensations are normal in the left torso, leg and foot. Touch, vibration, position, pain, and temperature sensations are normal for the rest of the body and face."
"The result of the Romberg test is negative. Anterolateral cordotomy has been used to relieve intractable pain. When the cut is limited to section of the spinothalamic tract, there is a decrease in pain and temperature sensitivity."
"As the posterior funiculus is not involved in the section, discriminative touch and proprioception remain intact. The deficit in pain and temperature sensitivity is contralesional and extends down the length of the body from the site of the lesion. However, pain sensation often returns, albeit in a different form, following the surgical section of the spinothalamic tract."
The patient suffers from loss of pain and temperature sensations from the left half of the body starting just below the left nipple and extending down to and including his left foot. He also exhibits loss of discriminative touch and proprioception in a corresponding area on the right side of his body. Symptoms: The patient exhibits a loss in voluntary control of the right leg.
He also reports loss of sensation in both feet . Physical examination determines that there are losses of pain and temperature sensations involving the left half of his body starting just below the left nipple and extending down to include his left foot. There are also loss of vibration and position sensations and poor localization of tactile stimuli on the right side of his body starting just below the right nipple and extending down to include his right foot.
"Touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal for the rest of the body and face. The Romberg test is positive . Hemisection of the Spinal Cord."
"The symptoms resulting from hemisection of the spinal cord  are collectively called the Brown-Sequard syndrome . There are both motor and sensory losses: for now learn that the motor losses involve weakness, loss of fine motor control, and abnormal reflexes  on the ipsilesional side starting at the level of the lesion and extending down the body. For example, if the right spinal cord is sectioned, say at T5, the motor effect is on the right side starting at the chest and extending down to and including the right leg and foot."
"Because spinal cord hemisection interrupts both the posterior column and spinothalamic tracts, there will be sensory losses that are bilateral: ipsilesional for the posterior column  and contralesional for the spinothalamic tracts . As the sensory losses in each half of the body differ, they are sometimes referred to as “dissociate anesthesia. ” Symptoms: The patient exhibits loss of pain and temperature sensations that are bilateral and limited to his waist area ."
"While pain sensation is diminished around the waist, it is normal above and below the waist. Discriminative touch, vibration and position senses are normal in the waist area and for the rest of the body and face. In syringomyelia, there are cysts that form within the spinal cord near the central canal ."
"As the cyst grows, it first compresses and then destroys the decussating fibers in the anterior white commissure. Many of these fibers belong to the spinothalamic tracts and the resulting sensory loss involves pain and temperature sensation bilaterally and segmentally. The bilateral loss is described to form a belt or girdle pattern - if the damage involves the lower thoracic segments, and does not involve sensation below and above the cyst ."
"As the cyst grows, it may involve anterior horn motor neurons and produce such “lower motor” signs as weakness, muscle wasting, and loss of reflexes. Brain Stem. Trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis , and brain tumors are the major causes of brain stem lesions."
"The location of the lesion site can often be deduced by the loss in cranial nerve function. Eleven of the thirteen cranial nerves are associated with the brain stem and may be damaged with brain stem lesions. Most of the 1° somatosensory afferents carrying crude touch, pain and temperature information from the face enter the brain stem at mid pontine levels and descend down to second cervical segment of the spinal cord."
"Axons in the spinothalamic pathway decussate in the spinal cord. The decussation in the medial lemniscal pathway occurs in the lower medulla. Consequently, both the spinothalamic tract and medial lemniscus represent the contralateral side of the body at and above the upper  medulla."
"The spinal trigeminal 2° afferents decussate upon leaving the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla and lower pons, whereas the main sensory trigeminal nucleus axons decussate at mid pons levels immediately upon leaving the nucleus. Above the level of the pons, all of the somatosensory pathways have decussated and are traveling in close proximity. The initial higher order processing the discriminative touch and proprioception occurs exclusively within the primary somatosensory cortex."
"In contrast, pain information is processed in multiple cortical areas. Symptoms: The patient exhibits decrease in pain and temperature sensations that involve the left side of his body and right side of his face . Discriminative touch, vibration and position senses are normal in these areas."
"Touch, vibration, position, temperature, and pain sensations are normal for the rest of the body and face. Wallenberg's Syndrome. In the medulla, both the spinothalamic tracts and the spinal trigeminal tracts are located posteriorly in the area that normally receives blood via branches of the posterior inferior cerebella artery  ."
"Consequently, an obstruction of the PICA blood supply to the medulla will result in analgesia and thermo-anesthesia of the contralesional body  and of the ipsilesional face . Branches of the anterior spinal and vertebral arteries supply more anterior areas of the upper medulla. Therefore, an infarct involving the PICA blood supply will not affect the medial lemniscus or ventral trigeminal lemniscus."
"Consequently, discriminative touch and proprioception from the body and pain, temperature and crude touch in the contralesional half of the face will not be affected with an infarct involving PICA. Above the level of the pons , all of the major somatosensory tracts are crossed and located in close proximity. Consequently, if the brain stem were hemisected above the pons, there would be anesthesia of the contralesional body  and contralesional face ."
"Somatosensory Cortex. Hemorrhage limited to somatosensory parietal areas produces contralesional astereognosis, baragnosis, and losses in the ability to discriminate object size and texture. Also decreased or lost on the contralesional side of the body are the ability to discriminate position and movement of body parts and the control of fine movements."
"The hemorrhage would not produce a total loss of pain sensation as other cortical areas are also involved in the perception of painful stimuli. For example, the cingulate gyrus in the frontal lobe and part of the insular cortex appear to be involved in the perception of, and emotional reaction to, painful stimuli . From this chapter, you should have learned how the somatosensory system is organized from the skin, muscles and joints to the cortex."
You have learned that stimulus features extracted by the somatosensory receptors are kept segregated in separate “information channels” and processed in parallel by different chains of neurons. Information coded and carried by thousands of spinal cord and cranial ganglion cells are distributed to millions of cortical neurons in the parietal lobe. The perceptions of coherent somatosensory stimuli and body image are recomposed out of these fragments of information by the simultaneous activation of large areas of cortex.
"You have learned how to use the somatotopic organization and the modality specificity of the different somatosensory pathways to determine the location and extent of damage to the somatosensory structures. Most of the sensory and somatosensory modalities are primarily informative, whereas pain is a protective modality. Pain differs from the classical senses  because it is both a discriminative sensation and a graded emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage."
"Pain is a submodality of somatic sensation. The word ""pain"" is used to describe a wide range of unpleasant sensory and emotional experiences associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Nature has made sure that pain is a signal we cannot ignore."
Pain information is transmitted to the CNS via three major pathways . Most ailments of the body cause pain. The ability to diagnose different diseases depends to a great extent on the knowledge of the different qualities and causes of pain.
"Sensitivity and reactivity to noxious stimuli are essential to the well-being and survival of an organism. Pain travels through redundant pathways, ensuring to inform the subject: “Get out of this situation immediately. ” Without these attributes, the organism has no means to prevent or minimize tissue injury."
"Individuals congenitally insensitive to pain are easily injured and most of them die at an early age. For thousands of years, physicians have tried to treat pain without knowing the details of the ways in which pain is signaled from the injured part of the body to the brain, or the ways in which any of their remedies worked. Recent discoveries about how the body detects, transmits and reacts to painful stimuli, have allowed physicians to relieve both acute and chronic pain."
"Pain is termed nociceptive , and nociceptive means sensitive to noxious stimuli. Noxious stimuli are stimuli that elicit tissue damage and activate nociceptors. Nociceptors are sensory receptors that detect signals from damaged tissue or the threat of damage and indirectly also respond to chemicals released from the damaged tissue."
"Nociceptors are free  nerve endings found in the skin , muscle, joints, bone and viscera. Recently, it was found that nerve endings contain transient receptor potential  channels that sense and detect damage. The TRP channels are similar to voltage-gated potassium channels or nucleotide-gated channels, having 6 transmembrane domains with a pore between domains 5 and 6."
"They transduce a variety of noxious stimuli into receptor potentials, which in turn initiate action potential in the pain nerve fibers. This action potential is transmitted to the spinal cord and makes a synaptic connection in lamina I and/or II. The cell bodies of nociceptors are mainly in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia."
"No nociceptors are found inside the CNS. Nociceptors are not uniformly sensitive. They fall into several categories, depending on their responses to mechanical, thermal, and/or chemical stimulation liberated by the damage, tumor, and/or inflammation."
Skin Nociceptors. Skin nociceptors may be divided into four categories based on function. The first type is termed high threshold mechanonociceptors or specific nociceptors.
"These nociceptors respond only to intense mechanical stimulation such as pinching, cutting or stretching. The second type is the thermal nociceptors, which respond to the above stimuli as well as to thermal stimuli. The third type is chemical nociceptors, which respond only to chemical substances ."
"A fourth type is known as polymodal nociceptors, which respond to high intensity stimuli such as mechanical, thermal and to chemical substances like the previous three types. A characteristic feature of nociceptors is their tendency to be sensitized by prolonged stimulation, making them respond to other sensations as well. Joint Nociceptors."
"The joint capsules and ligaments contain high-threshold mechanoreceptors, polymodal nociceptors, and ""silent"" nociceptors. Many of the fibers innervating these endings in the joint capsule contain neuropeptides, such as substance P  and calcitonin gene-related peptide . Liberation of such peptides is believed to play a role in the development of inflammatory arthritis."
"Visceral Nociceptors. Visceral organs contain mechanical pressure, temperature, chemical and silent nociceptors. The visceral nociceptors are scattered, with several millimeters between them, and in some organs, there are several centimeters between each nociceptor ."
Many of the visceral nociceptors are silent. The noxious information from visceral organs and skin are carried to the CNS in different pathways . Silent Nociceptors.
"In the skin and deep tissues there are additional nociceptors called ""silent"" or ""sleep"" nociceptors. These receptors are normally unresponsive to noxious mechanical stimulation, but become “awakened”  to mechanical stimulation during inflammation and after tissue injury. One possible explanation of the ""awakening"" phenomenon is that continuous stimulation from the damaged tissue reduces the threshold of these nociceptors and causes them to begin to respond."
"This activation of silent nociceptors may contribute to the induction of hyperalgesia, central sensitization, and allodynia . Many visceral nociceptors are silent nociceptors. Activation of the nociceptor initiates the process by which pain is experienced, ."
"These receptors relay information to the CNS about the intensity and location of the painful stimulus. Nociceptors respond when a stimulus causes tissue damage, such as that resulting from cut strong mechanical pressure, extreme heat, etc. The damage of tissue results in a release of a variety of substances from lysed cells as well as from new substances synthesized at the site of the injury ."
"Some of these substances activate the TRP channels which in turn initiate action potentials. These substances include:  Globulin and protein kinases. It has been suggested that damaged tissue releases globulin and protein kinases, which are believed to be amongst the most active pain-producing substances."
Minute subcutaneous injections of globulin induce severe pain. Arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is one of the chemicals released during tissue damage.
"It is then metabolized into prostaglandin . The action of the prostaglandins is mediated through a G protein, protein kinase A cascade. The prostaglandins block the potassium efflux released from nociceptors following damage, which results in additional depolarization."
This makes the nociceptors more sensitive. Aspirin is an effective pain killer because it blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin. Histamine.
Tissue damage stimulates the mast cells to release histamine to the surrounding area. Histamine excites the nociceptors. Minute subcutaneous injections of histamine elicit pain.
Nerve growth factor . Inflammation or tissue damage triggers the release of NGF. NGF then binds to TrkA receptors on the surfaces of nociceptors leading to their activation.
"Minute subcutaneous injections of NGF elicit pain. Substance P  and calcitonin gene-related peptide  are released by injury. Inflammation of tissue damage also results in SP and CGRP release, which excites nociceptors."
"Minute subcutaneous injection of substance P and CGRP elicits pain. Both peptides produce vasodilation, which results in the spread of edema around the initial damage. Potassium - K+."
"Most tissue damage results in an increase in extracellular K+. There is a good correlation between pain intensity and local K+ concentration. Serotonin , acetylcholine , low pH  solution, and ATP."
These substances are released with tissue damage. Subcutaneous injections of minute qualities of these products excite nociceptors. Muscle spasm and lactic acid.
"Not only can some headaches result from muscle spasms of smooth muscle, stretching of a ligament can also elicit pain. When muscles are hyperactive or when blood flow to a muscle is blocked, lactic acid concentration increases and pain is induced. The greater the rate of tissue metabolism, the more rapidly the pain appears."
Minute subcutaneous injections of lactic acid excite nociceptors. The release of these substances sensitizes the nociceptors  and reduces their threshold. This effect is referred to as peripheral sensitization .
"Within 15-30 seconds after injury, an area of several cm around the injured site shows reddening  called a flare. This response  becomes maximal after 5-10 minutes , and this region shows a lowered pain threshold . Hyperalgesia."
"Hyperalgesia is an increased painful sensation in response to additional noxious stimuli. One explanation for hyperalgesia is that the threshold for pain in the area surrounding an inflamed or injured site is lowered. An additional explanation is that the inflammation activates silent nociceptors and/or the damage elicits ongoing nerve signals , which led to long-term changes and sensitized nociceptors."
"These changes contribute to an amplification of pain or hyperalgesia, as well as an increased persistence of the pain. If one pricks normal skin with a sharp probe, it will elicit sharp pain followed by reddened skin. The reddened skin is an area of hyperalgesia."
"Allodynia. Allodynia is pain resulting from a stimulus that does not normally produce pain. For example, light touch to sunburned skin produces pain because nociceptors in the skin have been sensitized as a result of reducing the threshold of the silent nociceptors."
"Another explanation of allodynia is that when peripheral neurons are damaged, structural changes occur and the damaged neurons reroute and make connection also to sensory receptors . In conclusion, the several kinds of endogenous chemicals are produced with tissue damage and inflammation. These products have excitatory effects on nociceptors."
"However, it is not known whether nociceptors respond directly to the noxious stimulus or indirectly by means of one or more chemical intermediaries released from the traumatized tissue. Exposing the skin to controlled heat  makes it possible to measure the threshold for pain. When the temperature of the skin reaches 45 ± 1°C, subjects report pain."
"Non-noxious thermal  receptors are innervated by different types of nerve fibers than those responding to the pain. A temperature of approximately 45ºC denatures tissue protein and elicits damage in all subjects . That is, the pain threshold in all subjects is about the same."
"However, the response to pain is different among people. Pain is measured by the degree of pain intensity. Different degrees of pain intensity are defined as Just Noticeable Differences ."
"There are 22 JND for pain elicited by heat to the skin . This discrimination is possible because the discharge frequency of the nociceptors increases with increasing skin temperature . Thus, nociceptors also supply information on the stimulus intensity  in addition to the injury location."
"The cell bodies of the primary afferent pain neurons from the body, face, and head are located in the dorsal root ganglia  and in the trigeminal ganglia respectively. Some of these cell bodies give rise to myelinated axons , and others give rise to unmyelinated axons . The free nerve endings arise from both A delta fibers and the unmyelinated C fibers, which are scattered together ."
"A delta fibers  are 2-5 mm in diameter, myelinated, have a fast conduction velocity , and carry information mainly from the nociceptive-mechanical or mechanothermal-specific nociceptors. Their receptive fields are small. Therefore, they provide precise localization of pain."
"C fibers  are 0. 4-1. 2 mm in diameter, unmyelinated, have a slow conduction velocity , and are activated by a variety of high-intensity mechanical, chemical and thermal stimulation and carry information from polymodal nociceptors."
"C-fibers comprise about 70% of all the fibers carrying noxious input. Two classes of C-fibers have been identified. The receptive field of these neurons is large and, therefore, less precise for pain localization."
"Upon entering the spinal cord, the pain fibers bifurcate and ascend and descend to several segments, forming part of the tract of Lissauer before synapsing on neurons on Rexed layers I to II. In general, nociceptors responding to noxious stimuli transmit the information to the CNS via A delta fibers, which make synaptic connections to neurons in Rexed layer I . The nociceptors responding to chemical or thermal stimuli  carry their activity mainly by C unmyelinated fibers."
"One class of C fibers terminates in Rexed layer I, and the second class terminates in Rexed layer II . These fibers release substance P, glutamate, aspartate calcitonin gene related peptide , vasoactive intestinal polypeptide , and nitric oxide. Two sequential pain sensations in short time intervals is the result of sudden painful stimulation."
The first one is immediately after the damage. It is followed several seconds later with additional pain sensation. These two separate sensations are several seconds apart because a fast transmitting information sensation is carried via A delta fibers and is followed several seconds later with slow transmitting pain information carried via C fibers.
"This phenomenon is known as “double pain sensation” . Two experimental procedures were used to verify which information is carried by which fibers. Externally applied pressure, such as compression of the skin above a nerve, first blocks the myelinated A delta fibers, while C fibers continue to conduct action potentials and allow the slow conducting pain to be carried."
"A low dose of local anesthesia applied to peripheral nerves blocks the unmyelinated C fibers before the myelinated A delta fibers. Under this condition, the slow conducting pain information is blocked, and only the fast conducting pain information by A delta fibers is carried to the CNS. This experiment provides additional evidence that two different types of nerve fibers carry noxious information."
"The synaptic terminals of the axons of the dorsal root ganglion, which carry noxious information arriving to Rexed layers I and II , release neurochemical agents such as substance P , glutamate, aspartate, vasoactive intestinal peptide , cholecystokinin , somatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide , galanin, and other agents. These agents activate the nocineurons. It was shown that when SP and CGRP are applied locally within the spinal cord dorsal horn, glutamate is released."
"The release of glutamate excites the nocineurons. Furthermore, SP receptors  and NMDA receptors  interact which result that the NMDA receptors will become more sensitive to glutamate, which results in central sensitization. The functions of these peptides are largely unknown but they presumably mediate slow, modulatory synaptic actions in the dorsal horn neurons."
"The neuropeptides are always co-localized with other ""classical"" neurotransmitters. There are four general types of nocineurons in the spinal cord :  High threshold mechanoreceptor neurons or nociceptive specific neurons. These neurons are excited only by noxious cutaneous and/or visceral stimuli."
The nociceptive afferent fibers release glutamate and different neuropeptides to activate the dorsal horn neurons. Chemical nociceptor neurons are excited by chemical or thermal noxious stimulus in the skin or in visceral organs. Thermal nociceptor neurons are excited by chemical or thermal noxious stimulus in the skin or in visceral organs.
"Polymodal-nociceptive neurons or multi, or wide dynamic range nociceptive neurons. These neurons are excited by both noxious and non-noxious cutaneous and/or visceral stimuli . These neurons are activated by a variety of noxious stimuli  and respond incrementally to increasing intensity of the stimuli."
"Rexed lamina I contains a higher proportion of nociceptive specific neurons, whereas Rexed lamina II contains predominantly multi-receptive wide dynamic range neurons. The nociceptive-specific neurons alert the subject when a stimulus is noxious, and the multi-receptive neurons provide the subject with information about the parameters of the noxious stimulus. In general, C fibers release neuropeptides such as substance P whereas the A delta fibers release glutamate."
"Pain has been classified into three major types:  Pricking pain. Pain caused by a needle, pin prick, skin cut, etc. - elicits a sharp, pricking quality, stinging pain sensation carried fast by the A delta fibers."
"The pain is precisely localized and of short duration. Pricking pain is also called fast pain, first pain or sensory pain. Pricking pain is present in all individuals and is a useful and necessary component of our sensory repertoire."
"Without this type of protective pain sensation, everyday life would be difficult. Pricking pain arises mainly from the skin, and carried mainly by A delta fibers which permits discrimination . Burning pain or soreness pain."
"Pain caused by inflammation, burned skin, etc. , is carried by the C fibers . This type of pain is a more diffuse, slower to onset, and longer in duration."
"It is an annoying pain and intolerable pain, which is not distinctly localized. Like pricking pain, burning pain arises mainly from the skin. It is carried by the paleospinothalamic tract."
Aching pain is a sore pain. This pain arises mainly from the viscera and somatic deep structures. Aching pain is not distinctly localized and is an annoying and intolerable pain.
"Aching pain is carried by the C fibers from the deep structures to the spinal cord. Sensitivity and reactivity to noxious stimuli are essential to the well-being and survival of an organism. Without these attributes, the organism has no means to prevent or minimize tissue injury."
"Given the importance of pain sensation, it is not surprising that the central and peripheral neuronal pathways that subserve the transmission of nociceptive information and the pathway that transmits and modulates this somatosensory transmission are essential to understanding this somatosensory modality. Pain travels through “redundant” pathways, ensuring to inform the subject to ""Get out of this situation immediately. "" The ascending pathways that mediate pain consist of three different tracts: the neospinothalamic tract, the paleospinothalamic tract and the archispinothalamic tract."
The first-order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglion  for all three pathways. Each pain tract originates in different spinal cord regions and ascends to terminate in different areas in the CNS. The neospinothalamic tract has few synapses and constitutes the classical lateral spinothalamic tract  .
"The first-order nociceptive neurons  make synaptic connections in Rexed layer I neurons . Axons from layer I neurons decussate in the anterior white commissure, at approximately the same level they enter the cord, and ascend in the contralateral anterolateral quadrant. Most of the pain fibers from the lower extremity and the body below the neck terminate in the ventroposterolateral  nucleus and ventroposteroinferior  nucleus of the thalamus, which serves as a relay station that sends the signals to the primary cortex."
"The VPL is thought to mainly be concerned with discriminatThe first-order nociceptive neurons from the head, face and intraoral structures have somata in the trigeminal ganglion . Trigeminal fibers enter the pons, descend to the medulla and make synaptic connections in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, cross the midline and ascend as trigeminothalamic tract . The A delta fibers terminate in the ventroposteromedial  thalamus, and the C fibers terminate in the parafasciculus  and centromedian  thalamus ."
The PF-CM complex is located within the intralaminar thalamus and are known also as intralaminar  nuclei. All of the neospinothalamic fibers terminating in VPL and VPM are somatotopically oriented and from there send axons that synapse on the primary somatosensory cortex . This pathway is responsible for the immediate awareness of a painful sensation and for awareness of the exact location of the painful stimulus.
The paleospinothalamic tract is phylogenetically old. The majority of the first-order nociceptive neurons make synaptic connections in Rexed layer II  and the second-order neurons make synaptic connections in laminae IV-VIII. The second-order neurons also receive input from mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors.
The nerve cells that furnish the paleospinothalamic tract are multireceptive or wide dynamic range nociceptors. Most of their axons cross and ascend in the spinal cord primarily in the anterior region and thus called the anterior spinal thalamic tract . These fibers contain several tracts.
"Each of them makes a synaptic connection in different locations: 1) in the mesencephalic reticular formation  and in the periaqueductal gray , and they are also called spinoreticular tract; 2) in the tectum, and these fibers are known as the spinotectal or spinomedullary tract; 3) in the PF-CM complex  and they are known as the spinothalamic tract . The above three fiber tracts are known also as the paleospinothalamic tract. The innervation of these three tracts is bilateral because some of the ascending fibers do not cross to the opposite side of the cord."
"From the PF and CM complex, these fibers synapse bilaterally in the somatosensory cortex . The paleospinothalamic pathway also activates brain stem nuclei which are the origin of descending pain suppression pathway regulating noxious input at the spinal cord level . The multisynaptic tracts which course via the reticular formation also project to the PF-CM  complex."
"There are extensive connections between the IL and the limbic areas such as the cingulate gyrus and the insular cortex, which is thought to be involved in processing the emotional components of pain. That is to say, the insular cortex integrates the sensory input with the cortical cognitive components to elicit the response to the sensation. The limbic structures, in turn, project to the hypothalamus and initiate visceral responses to pain."
"The intralaminar nuclei also projects to the frontal cortex, which in turn projects to the limbic structures where the emotional response to pain is mediated. The archispinothalamic tract is a multisynaptic diffuse tract or pathway and is phylogenetically the oldest tract that carries noxious information. The first-order nociceptive neurons make synaptic connections in Rexed layer II  and ascend to laminae IV to VII."
"From lamina IV to VII, fibers ascend and descend in the spinal cord via the multisynaptic propriospinal pathway  surrounding the grey matter to synapse with cells in the MRF-PAG area. Further multisynaptic diffuse pathways ascend to the intralaminar  areas of the thalamus  and also send collaterals to the hypothalamus and to the limbic system nuclei. These fibers mediate visceral, emotional and autonomic reactions to pain."
"Figure 7,5 summarizes the three major spinal thalamic pathways. Information about bodily events is conveyed by primary sensory fibers to higher brain centers through the dorsal column medial lemniscal pathways. This route is considered a ""touch pathway,"" separate from the spinal thalamic pathways."
"However, recent reports indicate that the dorsal column can also carry noxious information from the viscera and widespread skin regions. Somatic pain can be classified as either: 1) cutaneous, superficial or peripheral pain and 2) deep pain. Cutaneous, Superficial or Peripheral Pain."
"Pain that arises from the skin and muscles or peripheral nerves themselves. In general, this pain has two components, the initial response  followed by later response . These signals are transmitted via different pathway."
"Pricking pain reaches the CNS via neospinothalamic tract  to the VPL  and to the SCI. Burning and soreness pain resulting from tissue damage reaches the CNS via the paleospinothalamic tract  and archispinothalamic tract to brain stem nuclei and to PF-CM complex, etc. Deep pain."
"This pain arises from joint receptors tendons and fascia . The quality of deep pain is dull, aching or burning. Deep pain is accompanied by a definite autonomic response associated with sweating and nausea, changes in blood pressure and heart rate."
"Somatic deep pain reaches the CNS mainly via the paleospinothalamic  and archispinothalamic tract . Reaction to Somatic Pain. Sudden, unexpected damage to the skin is followed by three responses:  Startle response."
"This is a complex psychosomatic response to a sudden unexpected stimulus which includes: A flexion reflex, postural readjustment and orientation of the head and eyes to examine the damaged area. Autonomic response. This response includes: NE and E release, ACTH and/or cortisol release, and vasoconstriction and piloerection."
"Behavioral response. This response includes: Vocalization, rubbing designed to diminish pain, learning to respond to sudden pain and psychosomatic pain. In the visceral organs, nociceptors respond to mechanical stimulation such as pressure, tissue damage, and chemical stimulation."
"Most noxious information carried by visceral afferents does not give rise to conscious sensation. Visceral pain is diffuse, less precisely graded and typically accompanied by slowing of the heart, lowered blood pressure, cold sweats and nausea. It conveys also hunger, thirst, electrolyte balance, irregulation in the respiratory and circulatory systems."
"Many of these signals reach the CNS bilaterally  by the following three channels. In the visceral organs, free nerve endings are scattered, and any stimulus that excites these nerve endings causes visceral pain . Such stimuli include spasm of the smooth muscle in a hollow viscus, or distention or stretching of the ligament, such as a stone blocking the ureter or the gall ducts."
"Stretching of the tissues such as intestinal obstruction can also provoke visceral pain. Visceral pain is also caused by chemical means as a result of gastrointestinal lesions, and tumors as well as thrombosis of an artery. In many cases, visceral pain is not localized to the site of its cause, rather in a distant site."
"Stroke or occlusion in the thalamogeniculate artery , which supplies the lateroposterior half of the thalamus, can result in a thalamic lesion, which is often accompanied by neurologic conditions several months after the initial event. The condition is associated with a devastating intracranial pain in the contralateral side of the thalamic lesion and sensory loss. In some cases, severe facial pain is experienced without any sensory loss."
"The pain resulting from an intracranial lesion is also termed ""central pain. ""  Lesions in the spinothalamic tract and its targets of termination as well as local manifestations of diencephalic lesions are usually complex. They can induce alteration of sensory, motor and endocrine components because of the functional diversity of the thalamus."
"Subjects with this syndrome experience spontaneous aching and burning pain in body regions where sensory stimuli normally do not lead to pain. Because the brain and the spinal cord do not contain nociceptors, the pathological process presumably directly stimulates nociceptive pathways, or it prevents the activation of the pain suppression pathways. This condition is known also as thalamic pain syndrome or Dejerive-Roussy syndrome."
"Neuropathic pain is a sharp, shooting and devastating pain. It is a persistent pain that arises from functional changes occurring in the CNS secondary to peripheral nerve injury. Once the nerve is damaged, the damaged nerve elicits sustained activation of nociceptors and/or nociceptive afferents."
The neuropathic pain is due to an abnormal activation of the nociceptive system without specifically stimulating the nociceptors. Neuroplastic changes occurring in the CNS secondary to the afferent barrage are believed to culminate in CNS neuronal hyperexcitability. Many scientists suggest that “sensitization” of the nervous system following injury is a factor in neuropathic pain.
"Neuropathic pain can usually be controlled by anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. In some cases, such as in diabetics, AIDS, cancer, etc. , no treatment or relief is available to neuropathic pain."
"Neuropathic pain should not be confused with neurogenic pain, a term used to describe pain resulting from injury to a peripheral nerve but without necessarily implying any neuropathy. Psychic reaction to pain includes all the well-known responses to pain such as anguish, anxiety, crying, depression, nausea and excess muscular excitability through the body. These reactions vary tremendously from one person to another following a comparable degree of pain stimuli."
"The sensation of pain can be influenced by emotions, past experiences and suggestions. The same stimulus can elicit different responses in different subjects under the same conditions. Recently, Positron Emission Tomography  has been used to study pain pathways and psychosomatic pain centers."
"For example, volunteers had their hands dipped in hot water  while they were conscious. They then dipped their hand again in hot water  after a post-hypnotic suggestion that the pain would be either more or less unpleasant than the first time. The PET scans of their brains showed that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex changed in accordance with how unpleasant they expected the pain to be."
"However, the intensity in the primary somatosensory cortex remained constant . Referred pain is a painful sensation at a site other than the injured one. The pain is not localized to the site of its cause  but instead is localized to a distant site."
One possible exception is that the axons carry pain information from the viscera enter into the spinal cord by the same route as the cutaneous pain sensation axons. Within the spinal cord there is a convergence of the information on the same nocineurons. This convergence gives rise to the phenomenon of referred pain.
"For example, pain associated with angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction is referred to the left chest, left shoulder, and upper left arm . Pain resulting from distention of the colon is referred to the periumbilical area . The following are some hypothesis to explain referred pain  Common dermatome hypothesis."
"When pain is referred, it is usually to a structure that developed from the same embryonic segment or dermatome as the structure in which the pain originates. Radiating pain down the left arm is the result of a myocardial infarction , or pain originating from the shoulder . Convergence and facilitation theories ."
"Inputs from visceral and skin receptors converge on the same spinal cord neuron . Therefore, visceral pain is referred to skin area because the nociceptors' terminals from the viscera terminate in the spinal cord on the same neurons that receive input from the skin. Facilitation or irritable focus."
"Pain impulses from the viscera alone are unable to pass directly from spinal cord neurons to the brain, but create an ""irritable focus"". When visceral and skin impulses arrive together, the information transmitted to higher centers and the brain interprets the pain as being from the skin . Learned phenomenon."
"Visceral information arrives in the CNS. However, the brain interprets that the impulses originate from the site of a previous surgical operation, trauma or localized pathologic process. Phantom or illusory pain is the experience of pain without any signals from nociceptors."
"It occurs in a subject with previous injuries such as amputation in which the dorsal roots are literally absent from the cord. Even though no sensory signals can enter the cord, the subject often feels extreme pain in the denervated parts of the body. For example, an amputee will often apparently feel pain in a part of his body that has been removed."
The phenomenon of phantom limb pain is a common experience after a limb has been amputated or its sensory roots have been destroyed in which the pain is felt in a part of the body that no longer exists. Pain from an amputated arm is referred to the viscera as a result of disruption to the “balance” between different peripheral inputs to the dorsal horn. A complete break of the spinal cord also often leads to a phantom body pain below the level of the break.
"The source of phantom pain is complex and not well understood. It has been suggested that there may be abnormal discharges 1) from the remaining cut ends of nerves which grow into nodules called neuromas, 2) from overactive spinal neurons, 3) from abnormal flow of signals through the somatosensory cortex, or 4) from burst-firing neurons in the thalamus. Acute pain arises from activation of nociceptors for a limited time and is not associated with significant tissue damage ."
"Chronic pain is prolonged pain lasting for months or longer that arises from tissue injury, inflammation, nerve damage, tumor growth, lesion or occlusion of blood vessels. Chronic or inflammatory pain can sensitize  the nervous system, evoking chemical, functional, and even structural changes that serve to “prime the pain-processing pump”. Chronic pain, such as lower back pain, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, and headache  may result from constant inflammatory activity which activates G proteins."
"In some cases, the pain persists long after the injury heals, but there is no treatment that will eliminate the pain. One possible explanation for chronic pain is a phenomenon called sensitization. Following continuation and prolong noxious stimulation, nearby silent nociceptive neurons that previously were unresponsive to stimulation, now become responsive."
"In addition, some of the chemicals produced and released at the injured site also alter the physiological properties of nociceptors. The nociceptors begin to initiate pain signals spontaneously, which cause chronic pain. In addition, weak stimuli, such as a light touch that previously had no effect on these nociceptors, will further activate the nociceptors which result in severe pain signals."
This phenomenon is referred to as “peripheral sensitization. ” The outcome of peripheral sensitization results in a greater and more persistent barrage of nerve impulses firing in the CNS. The persistent barrage of nerve impulses results in long-term changes in nerve cell activity at the level of the spinal cord and higher centers in the brain.
This phenomena is referred to as “central sensitization”. It appears that peripheral and central sensitization persists after the injury apparently has healed. The sensitization of nociceptive neurons after injury results from the release of different chemicals from the damaged area.
"It is known that substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptides are released from peripheral nerve ending which stimulate most cells to release algesic substances which further potentiates the pain from the injury. In contrast, central sensitization resulting from severe and persistent injury which cause prolonged release of glutamate on nociceptive dorsal horn cells, this constant glutamate release via G protein dependent phosphorylation cascades results in opening of postsynaptic ion channels gated by the NMDA receptors. This phenomenon is also termed ""wind up."
""" This activation produces hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn cells and causes ""central sensitization. "" Pain experts now agree that treating chronic pain early and aggressively yields the best results and prevents patients from developing physical and psychological conditions that could worsen the pain. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread chronic pain throughout the body, including fatigue, anxiety and depression."
"It is now believed that it has a genetic component which tends to run in families. Because of the importance of warning signals of dangerous circumstances, several nociception pathways are involved to transmitting these signals and some of them are redundant. The neospinothalamic tract conducts fast pain  and provides information of the exact location of the noxious stimulus, and the multisynaptic paleospinothalamic and archispinothalamic tracts conduct slow pain , a pain which is poorly localized in nature."
"Pain activates many brain areas, which link sensation, perception, emotion, memory and motor reaction. Therefore, many pain clinics target their treatments to block the perception of pain using psychosomatic means of treatments such as biofeedback, hypnosis, physical therapy, electrical stimulation, and acupuncture-multimodal treatment. Most, if not all, ailments of the body cause pain."
Pain is interpreted and perceived in the brain. Pain is modulated by two primary types of drugs that work on the brain: analgesics and anesthetics. The term analgesic refers to a drug that relieves pain without loss of consciousness.
"The term central anesthesia refers to a drug that depresses the CNS. It is characterized by the absence of all perception of sensory modalities, including loss of consciousness without loss of vital functions. The most effective clinically used drugs for producing temporary analgesia and relief from pain are the opioid family, which includes morphine, and heroin."
"There are currently no other effective pain therapeutic alternatives to opiates. Several side effects resulting from opiate use include tolerance and drug dependence . In general, these drugs modulate the incoming pain information in the spinal and central sites, as well as relieve pain temporarily, and are also known as opiate producing analgesia ."
"Opiate antagonist is a drug that antagonizes the opioid effects, such as naloxone or naltrexone, etc. They are competitive antagonists of opiate receptors. The brain has a neuronal circuit and endogenous substances to modulate pain."
"Opioidergic neurotransmission is found throughout the brain and spinal cord and appears to influence many CNS functions, including nociception, cardiovascular functions, thermoregulation, respiration, neuroendocrine functions, neuroimmune functions, food intake, sexual activity, aggressive locomotor behavior as well as learning and memory. Opioids exert marked effects on mood and motivation and produce euphoria. Three classes of opioid receptors have been identified: μ-mu, δ-delta and κ-kappa."
"All three classes are widely distributed in the brain. The genes encoding each one of them have been cloned and found to be members of the G protein receptors. Moreover, three major classes of endogenous opioid peptides that interact with the above opiate receptors have been recognized in the CNS: β-endorphins, enkephalins and the dynorphins."
"These three opioid peptides are derived from a large protein precursor by three different genes: the proopiomelanocortin  gene, the proenkephalin gene and the prodynorphin gene. The opioid peptides modulate nociceptive input in two ways: 1) block neurotransmitter release by inhibiting Ca2+ influx into the presynaptic terminal, or 2) open potassium channels, which hyperpolarizes neurons and inhibits spike activity. They act on various receptors in the brain and spinal cord."
"Enkephalins are considered the putative ligands for the δ receptors, β endorphins for the μ-receptors, and dynorphins for the κ receptors. The various types of opioid receptors are distributed differently within the central and peripheral nervous system. There is evidence for functional differences in these receptors in various structures."
"This explains why many unwanted side effects occur following opiate treatments. For example, mu  receptors are widespread in the brain stem parabrachial nuclei, a respiratory center and inhibition of these neurons elicits respiratory depression. Central or peripheral terminals of nociceptive afferent fibers contain opiate receptors where exogenous and endogenous opioids could act to modulate the ability to transmit nociceptive information."
"Moreover, high densities of opiate receptors are found in periaqueductal gray , nucleus raphe magnus , and dorsal raphe  in the rostral ventral medulla, in the spinal cord, caudate nucleus , septal nucleus, hypothalamus, habenula and hippocampus. Additional details on opiate receptors is provided later in this lecture. Systemically administered opioids at analgesic doses activate spinal and supraspinal mechanisms via μ, δ, and κ type opioid receptors and modulate pain signals."
"For many years it was suggested that somewhere in the CNS there is a circuit that can modulate incoming pain information. The gate control theory and the ascending/descending pain transmission system are two suggestions of such a circuit. The first pain modulatory mechanism called the ""Gate Control"" theory was proposed by Melzack and Wall in the mid 1960s."
"The concept of the gate control theory is that non-painful input closes the gates to painful input, which results in prevention of the pain sensation from traveling to the CNS . The theory suggests that collaterals of the large sensory fibers carrying cutaneous sensory input activate inhibitory interneurons, which inhibit  pain transmission information carried by the pain fibers. Non-noxious input suppresses pain, or sensory input “closes the gate” to noxious input ."
"The gate theory predicts that at the spinal cord level, non-noxious stimulation will produce presynaptic inhibition on dorsal root nociceptor fibers that synapse on nociceptors spinal neurons , and this presynaptic inhibition will block incoming noxious information from reaching the CNS . The gate theory was the rationale for the idea behind the production and the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation  for pain relief. To be effective, the TENS unit produces two different current frequencies below the pain threshold that can be tolerated by the patient."
"This procedure has partial success in pain therapy. Evidence for an intrinsic analgesia system was demonstrated by intracranial electrical stimulation of certain discrete brain sites. These areas are the periaqueductal gray  and nucleus raphe magnus , dorsal raphe , caudate nucleus , septal nucleus  and other nuclei."
"Such stimulation inhibits pain, , while the touch, pressure and temperature sensation remain intact. SPA is more pronounced and lasts a longer time after stimulation in humans than in experimental animals. Moreover, during SPA, the subjects still respond to nonpainful stimuli such as touch and temperature within the circumscribed area of analgesia."
"The most effective CNS sites for SPA are the PAG and the raphe nuclei . Electrical stimulation of PAG or NRM inhibits spinal thalamic cells,  in laminae I, II and V so that the noxious information from the nociceptors are modulated at the spinal cord level. PAG has neuronal connections to NRM."
"The action of the PAG most likely occurs by activation of the descending pathway from NRM and probably also by activation of ascending connections acting on higher subcortical levels of the CNS. Moreover, electrical stimulation of PAG or NRM produces behavioral analgesia, . Stimulation produced analgesia  elicits release of endorphin and is blocked by the opiate antagonist naloxone."
"During PAG and/or RN stimulation, serotonin  is also released from ascending and descending axons in subcortical nuclei, in spinal trigeminal nuclei and in the spinal cord. This release of 5-HT modulates pain transmission by inhibiting incoming sensory activity. Depletion of 5-HT by electrical lesion of the raphe nuclei or by a neurotoxic lesion produced by local injection of a chemical agent like parachlorophenylalanine  results in blocking the ability of both opiate  and electrical stimulation to produce analgesia."
"To verify whether the electrical stimulation produced analgesia via the release of opiate and serotonin, the area was locally microinjected with morphine or 5-HT. These microinjections indeed produce analgesia . These procedures also provide a method of identifying brain regions associated with pain suppression and help to produce a map of pain centers."
"The most effective method of producing opiate analgesia  is by intracerebral injection of morphine into the PAG. The PAG and RN and other brain structures where analgesia is produced are also rich in opiate receptors. Intracerebral opioid administration produced analgesia and SPA can be blocked by either systemic or by local microinjections of naloxone, the morphine antagonist, into the PAG or RN."
"Therefore, it has been suggested that the two  operate by a common mechanism. If OA and SPA act through the same intrinsic system, then the hypothesis that opiates activate a pain-suppression mechanism is more likely. In fact, present evidence indicates that microinjections of an opiate into the PAG activate an efferent brainstem system that suppresses pain transmission at segmental  levels ."
These observations indicate that analgesia elicited from the PAG requires a descending pathway to the spinal cord. The primary ascending pain fibers  reach the dorsal horn of the spinal cord from peripheral sites to innervate the nociceptor neurons in Rexed laminae I & II. Cells from Rexed lamina II make synaptic connections in Rexed layers IV to VII.
"Cells, especially in laminae I and VII of the dorsal horn, give rise to ascending spinothalamic tracts. At the spinal level, opiate receptors are located at the presynaptic ends of the nocineurons and at the interneural level layers IV to VII in the dorsal horn. Activation of opiate receptors at the interneuronal level produces hyperpolarization of the neurons, which result in the inhibition of firing and the release of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission, thereby blocking pain transmission."
"The circuit that consists of the periaqueductal gray  matter in the upper brain stem, the locus coeruleus , the nucleus raphe magnus  and the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis  contributes to the descending pain suppression pathway, which inhibits incoming pain information at the spinal cord level. As mentioned previously, opioids interact with the opiate receptors at different CNS levels. These opiate receptors are the normal target sites for neurotransmitters and endogenous opiates such as the endorphins and enkephalins."
"As a result of binding at the receptor in subcortical sites, secondary changes which lead to a change in the electrophysiological properties of these neurons and modulation of the ascending pain information. What activates the PAG to exert its effects? It was found that noxious stimulation excites neurons in the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis ."
"The nucleus Rgc innervates both the PAG and NRM. The PAG sends axons to NRM, and neurons in NRM send their axons to the spinal cord. Moreover, bilateral dorsolateral funiculus  lesions  block the analgesia produced by both electrical stimulation and by microinjection of opiates directly into the PAG and NRM, but they only attenuate the systemic analgesic effects of opiates ."
"These observations support the hypothesis that discrete descending pathways in the DLF are necessary for both OA and SPA. The DLF is comprised of fibers originating from several brainstem nuclei, which are serotonergic  from neurons located within the nucleus raphe magnus ; dopaminergic neurons originating from ventral tegmental area  and adrenergic neurons originating from the locus coeruleus . These descending fibers suppress noxious input at the nociceptive spinal cord neurons in laminae I, II, and V."
"Opiate receptors have also been found in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, mainly in Rexed laminae I, II, and V, and these spinal opiate receptors mediate inhibitory effects on dorsal horn neurons transmitting nociceptive information. The action of morphine appears to be exerted both in the spinal cord and brainstem nuclei . Systemic morphine acts on both brain stem and spinal cord opiate receptors to produce analgesia."
"Morphine binds the brainstem opiate receptors, which activates the brainstem descending serotonergic pathway to spinal cord , and they have an opioid-mediated synapse at the level of the spinal cord. This observation suggests that noxious stimuli  are critical for activation of the descending pain modulation circuit . In addition, there are ascending connections from the PAG and raphe nuclei to PF-CM complex."
These thalamic areas are part of the ascending pain modulation at the diencephalon level. Analgesia may be produced in certain stressful situations. Exposure to a variety of painful or stressful events produces an analgesic reaction.
"This phenomenon is called stress induced analgesia . SIA has been thought to provide insight into the psychological and physiological factors that activate endogenous pain control and opiate systems. For example, soldiers wounded in battle or athletes injured in sports events sometimes report that they do not feel pain during the battle or game; however, they will experience the pain later after the battle or game has ended."
"It has been demonstrated  that electrical shocks cause stress-induced analgesia. Based on these experiments, it is assumed that the stress the soldiers and the athletes experienced suppressed the pain which they would later experience. It has been suggested that endogenous opiates are released in response to stress and inhibit pain by activating the midbrain descending system."
"Moreover, some SIA exhibited cross tolerance with opiate analgesia, which indicates that this SIA is mediated via opiate receptors. Experiments using different parameters of electrical shock stimulation demonstrate that such stress produces analgesia and some of these stresses that produce analgesia could be blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone, whereas others were not blocked by naloxone. These observations lead to the conclusion that both opiate and non-opiate forms of SIA exist."
"The modulation of pain by electrical brain stimulation results from the activation of descending inhibitory fibers, which modulate  the input and output of laminae I, II, V and VII neurons. The route from the PAG to the spinal cord is not direct. It appears to involve a link with the 5-HT-rich raphe nuclei, as well as norepinephrine  from the locus coeruleus  and dopamine  from the ventral tegmental area ."
"Axons from the raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus and VTA project to the spinal cord dorsal horn by way of the DLF to terminate in lamina I, II and IV to VII . Opioid and serotonergic antagonists reverse both local opiate analgesia and brain-stimulation produced analgesia. This suggests that OA and SPA are produced via the same descending inhibitory system."
"In conclusion, in the CNS, much of the information from the nociceptive afferent fibers results from excitatory discharges of multireceptive neurons. The pain information in the CNS is controlled by ascending and descending inhibitory systems, using endogenous opioids, or other endogenous substances like serotonin as inhibitory mediators. In addition, a powerful inhibition of pain-related information occurs in the spinal cord."
"These inhibitory systems can be activated by brain stimulation, intracerebral microinjection of morphine, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Centrally acting analgesic drugs activate these inhibitory control systems. However, pain is a complex perception that is influenced also by prior experience and by the context within which the noxious stimulus occurs."
"This sensation is also influenced by emotional state. Therefore, the response to pain varies from subject to subject. An appreciation of the flavor of foods requires the diverse interaction of several sensory systems."
"Taste and smell are the principal systems for distinguishing flavors. However, tactile, thermal, and nociceptive sensory input from the oral mucosa contributes to food quality. Saliva also is an important factor in maintaining acuity of taste receptor cells ."
"Its mechanisms of action include; acting as a solvent for polar solutes, transporting solutes to the taste receptors, buffering action for acidic foods and reparative action on the lingual epithelium. Recent technical advances in neurophysiology have made it possible to identify the physiological mechanisms of signal transduction for the detection and discrimination of various taste stimuli by the taste receptor cells. Taste buds are located on papillae and distributed on the surface of the tongue."
"Taste buds are also found on the oral mucosa of the palate and epiglottis. These pear-shaped structures contain about 80 cells arranged around a central taste pore . Taste receptor cells are spindle shaped, modified neuro-epithelial cells that extend from the base to the apex of the taste buds."
"Voltage-gated channel proteins for Na+, K+ & Ca2+ are present in the plasma membrane with the K+-gated channel proteins located in larger numbers on the apical membrane of the taste cells. Synaptic vesicles are present near the apex and the basal region in many taste cells. Microvilli from each taste cell project into the taste pore which communicate with the dissolved solutes on the surface of the tongue."
These receptor cells are innervated by afferent nerve fibers penetrating the basal lamina. The nerve fibers branch extensively and receive synaptic input from the taste receptor cells. A group of non-receptor columnar cells and basal cells are present within taste buds.
The basal cells migrate from adjacent lingual epithelium into the buds and differentiate into taste receptor cells which are replaced about every 9-10 days. Taste solutes are transported to the taste pore and diffuse through the fluid layer to make contact with membrane receptor proteins on the microvilli and apical membrane. Taste sensitivity is dependent upon the concentration of the taste molecules as well as their solubility in saliva.
"Many bitter tasting hydrophobic solutes interact with an odorant binding protein produced by von Ebner’s glands in the posterior region of the tongue. Taste sensation can be evoked by many diverse taste solutes. The pattern of membrane potential change include depolarization, depolarization followed by hyperpolarization, or only hyperpolarization."
"Action potentials in the taste receptor cells lead to an increase Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated membrane channels with the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In response to this cation, neurotransmitter is released, which produces synaptic potentials in the dendrites of the sensory nerves and action potentials in afferent nerve fibers . The taste of salts is mediated by Na+ ions which do not interact with a membrane receptor but diffuse through a Na+ channel located in the microvilli and apical membrane."
"Anions such as Cl- contribute to the salty taste, but anions are transported into these cells by a paracellular route. The influx of these ions of salt evokes a depolarization in the apical membrane . The hydrogen proton of acids and sour foods can influx through the Na+ channels, or through a proton transport membrane protein ."
"Some acids block the efflux of K+ at the microvilli. The resulting influx of protons or a reduction in K+ conductance will initiate receptor potentials in response to the quality of sour tastes. Sweet tasting solutes, sugars and related substances, bind to membrane receptor proteins which are coupled to a G-s protein , which activates adenylyl cyclase ."
"Cyclic AMP  dependent protein kinase  reduces K+ efflux in the apical membrane and produces membrane depolarization . Some sweet solutes and non-sugar sweeteners interact with a receptor membrane protein through a G protein, which activates phospholipase C. A second messenger, inositol triphosphate , is synthesized which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores."
"Accumulation of Ca2+ depolarizes the cell, releasing neurotransmitter at the synapse. Bitter tasting solutes include many non-toxic and toxic alkaloids, hydrophilic quinine and some divalent ions. The transduction of bitter tastes involves several mechanisms: 1) blockage of the efflux of K+ by a number of hydrophilic bitter substances generates a depolarizing potential; 2) interaction with a receptor membrane receptor coupled to the G protein, gustducin, and activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase with blockage of K+ channels; and 3) involves a receptor protein linked to G-protein and activation of phospholipase C, which results in substrate hydrolysis to IP3, releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores."
"These mechanisms for taste transduction were identified in laboratory animals and are probably present in the microvilli and apical membrane of taste receptor cells in humans. A fifth taste quality, umami, is predicted to interact with a ligand-gated inotropic glutamate receptor coupled to gustducin and to Ca2+ channel membrane proteins. Taste stimuli produce depolarizing and hyperpolarizing potentials in individual taste cells."
"Excitation of voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels can generate action potentials which are propagated toward the basal region of the taste cell. These currents open the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels near the base of the taste cells, which leads to the subsequent release of neurotransmitter. These transmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and lead to the initiation of action potentials in the afferent nerve fibers."
"Historically, regional differences for each taste quality were predicted to exist on the tongue’s surface . However, taste studies conducted on the neural response of whole cranial nerves demonstrate that a pattern of activity is produced by foods that are similar in taste. These patterns of activity are a clue to a taste code that occurs in many different taste cells and neurons responding to a particular taste stimulus."
"This finding indicates that no single fiber conducts only one taste quality , although it may respond best to one quality and least to another. Recognition that branches of nerve fibers innervate several cells within and between taste buds indicates that a population of sensory nerve fibers activated by a taste stimulus transmits a neural code of the taste quality. Branches of the facial cranial nerve, the chorda tympani, innervate taste buds in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue and part of the soft palate."
The glossopharyngeal innervate the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. Both the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves innervate the pharynx and epiglottis. Axons of these three cranial nerves terminate on 2nd order sensory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.
"From this site in the rostral medulla, axons project into the parabrachial nucleus in lower animals but not in humans. In humans, fibers of the 2nd order neurons travel through the ipsilateral central tegmental tract to the 3rd order sensory neurons in the ventroposterior medial nucleus  of the thalamus. The VPM projects to the ipsilateral gustatory cortex located near the post-central gyrus representing the tongue or to the insular cortex."
"The olfactory system in humans is an extremely discriminative and sensitive chemosensory system. Humans can distinguish between 1,000 to a predicted high of 4,000 odors. All of these odors can be classified into six major groups; floral, fruit, spicy, resin, burnt, and putrid ."
"The perception of odors begins with the inhalation and transport of volatile aromas to the olfactory mucosa that are located bilaterally in the dorsal posterior region of the nasal cavity. The olfactory mucosa consists of a layer of columnar epithelium, surrounding millions of olfactory neurons, which are the only neurons to communicate with the external environment and undergo constant replacement. Basal cells near the lamina propria undergo differentiation and develop into these neurons about every 5-8 weeks."
The glial-like columnar cells surround and support the bipolar neurons. These columnar cells have microvilli at their apex and secrete mucus which is layered on the surface of the olfactory mucosa . The bipolar olfactory neurons have a single dendrite which projects towards the apical mucosa.
"The terminal ending of the dendrites are flattened and have 5-25 cilia that are embedded in the mucosa on the surface. Each cilia may have as many as 40 specific receptor membrane proteins for interaction with different odorant molecules. The density of these receptors is enormous for humans, but significantly greater in many lower animals."
"Unbound hydrophilic odor molecules diffuse across the layer of mucus, whereas hydrophobic odors must become bound to a specific odorant binding protein to be transported to each cilium for interaction with specific receptors. All of these receptors have the same general structure, seven hydrophobic transmembrane regions, but the amino acid sequence within the cylinders spanning the membrane are extremely diverse which permits the discrimination of a large number of odors. Odorant molecules bind reversibly to the diverse receptor membrane proteins which are coupled to a G-s group of proteins called Golf."
Activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to the formation of cAMP with the activation of Ca2+/ Na+ cation channels. The primary effect of influx of these ions is depolarization and the generation of a generator potential . Generated ionic currents are graded in response to the flow rate of the odorant molecules and to their concentration.
"Sites of summated generator potentials occur across the olfactory mucosa to produce specific spatial pattern of activity for each stimulating odorant molecules, which may contribute to neural coding of odors. These spatial responses across the olfactory mucosa can be recorded  with surface electrodes. The resulting influx of Na+ and Ca2+ produces a depolarizing generator potential that spreads to the axon hillock."
"There, action potentials are generated, which are propagated to the synaptic endings in the olfactory bulb . The action potential frequency is proportional to the concentration of specific odorant molecules. However, action potential frequency will be attenuated by adaptation or desensitization of the receptor and reduction in the production of cAMP."
Rapid adaptation and removal of the odorants permit continued recognition and discrimination of new aromas that are inhaled in the next respiratory cycle. Action potentials generated in the axon terminals of activated neurons are propagated into the glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulbs have many different types of neurons and these have a laminar distribution.
On the ventral side of the olfactory bulbs is a layer of glomeruli. This is a site at which axon terminals of several thousand olfactory neurons synapse with numerous dendrites from large mitral cells and tufted cells. Interneurons such as the inhibitory periglomerular cells synapse with the nerve endings within adjacent glomeruli.
"Millions of axon fibers converge upon only a few thousand glomeruli within each bulb to synapse with about 75,000 mitral cells  and about twice this number of tufted/periglomerular cells. Mitral cells are 2nd order sensory neurons whose axons enter the olfactory tract and ascend to the olfactory cortex. This convergence/divergence between the axons of olfactory neurons and the specialized cells of the olfactory bulb generate excitatory postsynaptic potentials  in the dendrites of mitral cells and subsequent action potentials."
Lateral inhibition by the periglomerular cells modulates activity in adjacent glomeruli innervated by other mitral and tuft cells. A complex pattern of neuronal integration for discrimination of various odorant molecules is indicated by the mechanisms of convergence/divergence with excitation/inhibition of these 2nd order sensory neurons. This complexity is related to the recognition that no single odor stimulates a specific group of olfactory neurons.
Rather a neural code is created from the activation of multiple receptors and neurons. Axons from mitral and tuft cells project caudally into the olfactory tract. Fibers diverge and synapse with neurons of the anterior olfactory nucleus .
"Axons from the AON cross to the opposite side of the hemisphere through the anterior commissure. The majority of the axons from the olfactory bulb diverge laterally and form the lateral olfactory tract which synapse with nuclei of the olfactory cortex. These are the piriform cortex , the periamygdaloid cortex, part of the amygdala, and hippocampus."
"There are no direct relays from the olfactory bulb into the thalamus, but a few fibers synapse with 3rd order sensory neurons in the thalamic dorsomedial nucleus which are projected to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere . In conclusion, many olfactory receptors respond to more than one odorant quality just like the taste receptor cells. Coding of the primary odor depends on the intensity of the odor and on a population response within the olfactory neurons."
"During neural processing in the olfactory bulb, a particular discharge occurs to one odorant and a different pattern for another odorant. This sensory input must be processed before being relayed to the olfactory cortex for perception and recognition of the individual odor. All living organisms monitor their environment and one important aspect of that environment is gravity and the orientation of the body with respect to gravity."
"In addition, animals that locomote must be able to adjust their orientation with respect to self generated movements, as well as forces that are exerted upon them from the outside world. The vestibular system performs these essential tasks. It engages a number of reflex pathways that are responsible for making compensatory movements and adjustments in body position."
"It also engages pathways that project to the cortex to provide perceptions of gravity and movement. The first section of the Chapter begins with a description of the components of the peripheral sensory apparatus and describes the ways in which specialized receptors transduce mechanical signals into electrical events. The second section describes the projections of the vestibular afferents to the vestibular nuclei, and projection pathways from the vestibular nuclei to other brain structures such as the cerebellum."
"The membranous labyrinth of the inner ear consists of three semicircular ducts , two otolith organs , and the cochlea . Figure 10,1 shows the main action of the semicircular ducts. These sensory organs respond to angular acceleration."
"In Figure 10. 1, press the ""expand"" button to see progressively finer views of the horizontal semicircular duct. This expansion proceeds from the inner ear as it sits in the head, to a sketch of the horizontal semicircular duct, to a detail of the ampulla."
The ampulla is a localized dilatation at one end of the semicircular duct. A patch of innervated hair cells is found at the base of the ampulla in a structure termed a crista . The crista contains hair cells with stereocilia oriented in a consistent direction.
"The cupula, a thin vane, sits atop this crest, filling the lumen of the semicircular duct. The stereocilia of the hair cells are embedded in the gelatinous cupula. By pressing the ""play button"" in Figure 10,1, the animation will show the effects of head rotation."
"As the head rotates in one direction, inertia of the fluid causes it to lag, and hence generate relative motion in the semicircular duct in the direction opposite that of the head movement. This moving fluid bends the broad vane of the cupula. The stereocilia of the hair cells are bent because they are embedded in the gelatinous cupula."
"Shearing of the hair cells opens potassium channels, as discussed at the beginning of the auditory section . There are three pairs of semicircular ducts, which are oriented roughly 90 degrees to each other for maximum ability to detect angular rotation of the head. Each slender duct has one ampulla."
"When the head turns, fluid in one or more semicircular ducts pushes against the cupula and bends the cilia of the hair cells. Fluid in the corresponding semicircular duct on the opposite side of the head moves in the opposite direction. The basic transduction mechanism is the same in the auditory and vestibular systems ."
"A mechanical stimulus bends the cilia of the hair cells. Fine thread-like tip links connect to trap doors in the adjacent cilium. Bending the hair cells stretches the tip link, causing an influx of K+ ions and the generation of neural impulses in the VIIIth cranial nerve."
"Hair cells in the vestibular system are slightly different from those in the auditory system, in that vestibular hair cells have one tallest cilium, termed the kinocilium. Bending the stereocilia toward the kinocilium depolarizes the cell and results in increased afferent activity. Bending the stereocilia away from the kinocilium hyperpolarizes the cell and results in a decrease in afferent activity."
"The semicircular ducts work in pairs to detect head movements . A turn of the head excites the receptors in one ampulla and inhibits receptors in the ampulla on the other side. Figure 10,2 is an extension of Figure 10."
"1. Begin by pressing ""expand"" to show details from the horizontal semicircular ducts on both sides of the head. Beneath the ampullae are new details, which highlight the orientation of the stereocilia in both cristae and their outputs."
"The kinocilia are oriented in the direction of the ampullae  within the ducts on both sides. The two sides are mirror images. There is a constant low level of ionic influx into the body of the hair cells, so there is a steady-state receptor potential and a spontaneous low-level discharge of afferent activity."
"These neutral neurophysiological properties are shown in graphs below each ampulla. Figure 10,2 is a diagram of the cranial nerves and their nuclei that mediate interactions between the vestibular system and eye muscles appears as an inset. By pressing the ""play"" button you will see an animation of this."
"A constant low level of spontaneous activity keeps all the muscles slightly and equally contracted, causing the eyes to look straight ahead. When the head turns, inertia causes the fluid to move more slowly than the head, generating relative fluid motion in the semicircular duct in the opposite direction of the head turn. This moving fluid, shown by arrows in the lumens of the semicircular duct, bends the hair cells on both sides of the head."
"Because the two sides are mirror images, the stereocilia are bent toward their kinocilium on one side and away from their kinocilium on the other side. Shearing of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium causes a depolarization of the receptor potential and an increase in afferent action potentials. There is an opposite effect on the other side – a decrease in afferent activity."
"These counteracting bilateral changes in afferent activity affect the vestibular and oculomotor nuclei. The ampullo fugal movement of fluid on the patient's right  causes an increase in afferent activity . This has a positive effect on the right medial and superior vestibular nuclei, which in turn stimulate the ipsilateral oculomotor and contralateral abducens nuclei."
"There are exactly opposite effects on the other side . The result of these combined counteracting effects is a smooth movement of the eyes toward the left, keeping the visual field stable as the head turns. Figure 10,3 illustrates the otolithic organs, the saccule and utricle."
"Press ""expand"" to see the utricle at the top of Figure 10. 3 and the saccule at the bottom. These two similar organs lie against the walls of the inner ear between the semicircular ducts and the cochlea."
"The receptors, called maculae , are patches of hair cells topped by small, calcium carbonate crystals called otoconia. The saccule and utricle lie at 90 degrees to each other. Thus, with any position of the head, gravity will bend the cilia of one patch of hair cells, due to the weight of the otoconia to which they are attached by a gelatinous layer."
"This bending of the cilia produces afferent activity going through the VIIIth nerve to the brainstem. Activate Figure 10,3 to view the actions of the utricle and saccule. The utricle is most sensitive to tilt when the head is upright."
"The saccule is most sensitive to tilt when the head is horizontal. Unlike the semicircular ducts, the kinocilia of hair cells in the maculae are NOT oriented in a consistent direction. The kinocilia point toward  or away from  a middle line called the striola."
"The striola is shown as a dashed line in Figure 10. 3. Because hair cells are oriented in different directions, tilts in any direction will activate some afferents."
"The vestibulo-ocular reflex  controls eye movements to stabilize images during head movements. As the head moves in one direction, the eyes reflexively move in the other direction. The VOR is only effective up to a speed of about 50o/sec."
"The action of the VOR can be seen by moving your head from side to side. The image you see is stable, despite the head movement. But as you increase the speed of oscillatory head movements, you can get to a rate of angular velocity where the VOR is no longer effective, and you will see the visual image start to shift."
"The VOR would occur in the dark, because the eyes move due to angular acceleration of the head. The inset in Figure10,2 that appears when you press the ""play"" button shows the CNS connections involved in the VOR. This is a three-neuron circuit."
"One neuron is in Scarpa's  ganglion; one neuron is in a vestibular nucleus; and one neuron is in an extraocular motor nucleus. A variant of the VOR, called caloric nystagmus, is used as a test of the vestibular system. If the ear is irrigated with a fluid having a temperature different than the body , a thermal gradient will be conduced across the small space of the middle ear."
"Figure 10,4 shows a caloric response. Here, cold water is put in the right ear. About 20 ml is injected over about 30 s."
"The cold water cools the tympanic membrane, which cools the air in the middle ear, and finally the endolymph. This primarily affects the horizontal semicircular canal because it is close to the middle ear space. Cooling somehow hyperpolarizes the hair cells, causing the eyes to drift slowly to the right as if the head was moving to the left."
"When the eyes have moved as far to the side as they can go, there is a quick resetting movement in the opposite direction. This cycle of slow and fast eye-movements is called a nystagmus. Nystagmus is labeled by the direction of the fast component."
"Figure 10,4 is an illustration of a left-beating nystagmus. Caloric vestibular testing is quantified by the magnitude and direction of the nystagmus. A useful mnemonic is COWS, meaning ""cold-opposite warm-same""."
"That is, irrigation of one ear with cold water produces a nystagmus away from the irrigated ear, while warm water produces a nystagmus toward the same ear. The normal response in a caloric vestibular test is symmetric and opposite responses in both ears. Weakness of the caloric response , or a spontaneous nystagmus , indicates vestibular lesions."
"The first-order vestibular afferents have their cell bodies in the vestibular  ganglion, which is found at the distal end of the internal auditory meatus. Their axons travel in the vestibular portion of the VIIIth cranial nerve through the internal auditory meatus and enter the brain stem at the junction between the pons and the medulla where the IVth ventricle is the widest. Most of these afferents project to one of the four nearby vestibular nuclei in the rostral medulla and caudal pons."
A few of the vestibular afferents go directly to the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The cerebellum coordinates the movements that maintain balance. There are many connections between the cerebellum and the vestibular nuclei.
"Figure 11,1 shows a summary of these ascending and descending vestibular pathways. Upon pressing the ""play"" button, the four vestibular nuclei appear in outline. Note that the medial and inferior nuclei are usually seen together in the rostral medulla."
The lateral and superior nuclei are smaller and are seen in the pons. The ascending tracts are shown in blue. These arise from the superior and medial nuclei and ascend in medial longitudinal fasciculus  to the oculomotor nuclei .
The lateral vestibulospinal tract is shown in green. It descends ipsilaterally to the sacral cord. The medial vestibulospinal tract is shown in red.
"It descends bilaterally in the MLF to thoracic levels. The cerebellar afferents are not shown in this summary, but these come from the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei. The 1st order vestibular afferents arise in Scarpa's ganglion, which is in the distal portion of the internal auditory meatus."
"The axons travel in the vestibular portion of the VIIIth cranial nerve and enter the brain stem at the pontomedullary junction. There are four 2nd order vestibular nuclei: the inferior, medial, lateral  and superior vestibular nuclei. All four nuclei are found beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle in the medulla and pons, lateral to the sulcus limitans."
"The main projections from these nuclei are to the spinal cord , to the three, extraocular motor nuclei , to the thalamus , and to the cerebellum . The main descending tracts are the lateral vestibulospinal tract from the lateral vestibular nucleus and the medial vestibulospinal tract from the medial vestibular nucleus. The lateral vestibular tract starts in the lateral vestibular nucleus and descends the length of the spinal cord on the same side."
This pathway helps us walk upright. The medial vestibular tract starts in the medial vestibular nucleus and extends bilaterally through mid-thoracic levels of the spinal cord in the MLF. This tract affects head movements and helps integrate head and eye movements.
"In summary, remember that the lateral vestibulo-spinal tract is ipsilateral and long; the medial vestibulo-spinal tract is bilateral but shorter. The main ascending tracts are from the superior and medial vestibular nuclei to the extraocular muscles through the medial longitudinal fasciculus . Figure 11,2 shows details of the vestibular fibers ascending in the MLF to the oculomotor nuclei."
"Second-order afferents arise in the medial and superior vestibular nuclei. Connections from the MLF to the abducens, trochlear and oculomotor nuclei can be seen. These connections coordinate eye movements in response to head movements."
"Details of this coordination for horizontal eye movements are elaborated in the section on vestibular structure and function . Figure 11,3 shows controversial details of the ascending vestibular pathway that gives rise to the conscious perception. Afferents from primarily the superior vestibular nucleus ascend to the thalamus  probably in the lateral lemniscus or in the reticular formation beside the MLF."
"The primary cortical receiving areas for the vestibular system are more diffuse than for other sensory systems, and there is some dispute about their locations. Most people believe there is a cortical vestibular area in the parietal lobe near where the intraparietal sulcus meets the postcentral gyrus. This would be close to the somatic area of the head, which makes sense for the sensation of dizziness."
"Others believe there is an area of vestibular cortex anterior to primary auditory cortex. This pathway is bilateral. Figure 11,4 shows details of the vestibulo-cerebellar connections."
Some vestibular afferents go directly to the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Most 1st order afferents synapse in the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei and then ascend to the cerebellum in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Most of these afferents innervate the flocculonodular node.
"Many interconnections are found between the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, which coordinate the postural adjustments. Figure 11,5 shows details of the lateral vestibulospinal tract. As the name suggests, this tract arises in the lateral vestibular nucleus."
"The tract descends through the inferior vestibular nucleus, giving this nucleus its ""salt and pepper"" appearance. Below the medulla the lateral vestibulospinal tract descends in the anterior white matter down the entire length of the spinal cord. This tract modulates postural adjustments to movements."
"For example, the reason we stagger after spinning is due to excess activity in the lateral vestibulospinal tract. Figure 11,6 shows details of the medial vestibulospinal tract. As its name suggests, this tract starts in the medial vestibular nucleus."
It is a bilateral tract. It descends no lower than the mid-thoracic cord. It mediates head position by controlling the muscles of the neck and shoulder  The key structure in the vertebrate auditory and vestibular systems is the hair cell.
"The hair cell first appeared in fish as part of a long, thin array along the side of the body, sensing movements in the water. In higher vertebrates the internal fluid of the inner ear  bathes the hair cells, but these cells still sense movements in the surrounding fluid. Several specializations make human hair cells responsive to various forms of mechanical stimulation."
Hair cells in the Organ of Corti in the cochlea of the ear respond to sound. Hair cells in the cristae ampullares in the semicircular ducts respond to angular acceleration . Hair cells in the maculae of the saccule and the utricle respond to linear acceleration .
". The fluid, termed endolymph, which surrounds the hair cells is rich in potassium. This actively maintained ionic imbalance provides an energy store, which is used to trigger neural action potentials when the hair cells are moved."
"Tight junctions between hair cells and the nearby supporting cells form a barrier between endolymph and perilymph that maintains the ionic imbalance. Figure 12,1 illustrates the process of mechanical transduction at the tips of the hair cell cilia. Cilia emerge from the apical surface of hair cells."
These cilia increase in length along a consistent axis. There are tiny thread-like connections from the tip of each cilium to a non-specific cation channel on the side of the taller neighboring cilium. The tip links function like a string connected to a hinged hatch.
"When the cilia are bent toward the tallest one, the channels are opened, much like a trap door. Opening these channels allows an influx of potassium, which in turns opens calcium channels that initiates the receptor potential. This mechanism transduces mechanical energy into neural impulses."
"An inward K+ current depolarizes the cell, and opens voltage-dependent calcium channels. This in turn causes neurotransmitter release at the basal end of the hair cell, eliciting an action potential in the dendrites of the VIIIth cranial nerve. Press the ""play"" button to see the mechanical-to-electrical transduction."
"Hair cells normally have a small influx of K+ at rest, so there is some baseline activity in the afferent neurons. Bending the cilia toward the tallest one opens the potassium channels and increases afferent activity. Bending the cilia in the opposite direction closes the channels and decreases afferent activity."
Bending the cilia to the side has no effect on spontaneous neural activity. The auditory system changes a wide range of weak mechanical signals into a complex series of electrical signals in the central nervous system. Sound is a series of pressure changes in the air.
"Sounds often vary in frequency and intensity over time. Humans can detect sounds that cause movements only slightly greater than those of Brownian movement. Obviously, if we heard that ceaseless  motion of air molecules we would have no silence."
"Figure 12,2 depicts these alternating compression and rarefaction  waves impinging on the ear. The pinna and external auditory meatus collect these waves, change them slightly, and direct them to the tympanic membrane. The resulting movements of the eardrum are transmitted through the three middle-ear ossicles  to the fluid of the inner ear."
"The footplate of the stapes fits tightly into the oval window of the bony cochlea. The inner ear is filled with fluid. Since fluid is incompressible, as the stapes moves in and out there needs to be a compensatory movement in the opposite direction."
"Notice that the round window membrane, located beneath the oval window, moves in the opposite direction. Because the tympanic membrane has a larger area than the stapes footplate there is a hydraulic amplification of the sound pressure. Also because the arm of the malleus to which the tympanic membrane is attached is longer than the arm of the incus to which the stapes is attached, there is a slight amplification of the sound pressure by a lever action."
"These two impedance matching mechanisms effectively transmit air-born sound into the fluid of the inner ear. If the middle-ear apparatus  were absent, then sound reaching the oval and round windows would be largely reflected. The cochlea is a long coiled tube, with three channels divided by two thin membranes."
"The top tube is the scala vestibuli, which is connected to the oval window. The bottom tube is the scala tympani, which is connected to the round window. The middle tube is the scala media, which contains the Organ of Corti."
"The Organ of Corti sits on the basilar membrane, which forms the division between the scalae media and tympani. Figure 12,3 illustrates a cross section through the cochlea. The three scalae  are cut in several places as they spiral around a central core."
"The cochlea makes 2-1/2 turns in the human . The tightly coiled shape gives the cochlea its name, which means snail in Greek . As explained in Tonotopic Organization, high frequency sounds stimulate the base of the cochlea, whereas low frequency sounds stimulate the apex."
"This feature is depicted in the animation of Figure 12,3 with neural impulses  emerging from different turns of the cochlea. The activity in Figure 12,3 would be generated by white noise that has all frequencies at equal amplitudes. The moving dots are meant to indicate afferent action potentials."
"Low frequencies are transduced at the apex of the cochlea and are represented by red dots. High frequencies are transduced at base of the cochlea and are represented by blue dots. A consequence of this arrangement is that low frequencies are found in the central core of the cochlear nerve, with high frequencies on the outside."
"Figure 12,4 illustrates one cross section of the cochlea. Sound waves cause the oval and round windows at the base of the cochlea to move in opposite directions . This causes the basilar membrane to be displaced and starts a traveling wave that sweeps from the base toward the apex of the cochlea ."
"The traveling wave increases in amplitude as it moves, and reaches a peak at a place that is directly related to the frequency of the sound. The illustration shows a section of the cochlea that is moving in response to sound. Figure 12,5 illustrates a higher magnification of the Organ of Corti."
The traveling wave causes the basilar membrane and hence the Organ of Corti to move up and down. The organ of Corti has a central stiffening buttress formed by paired pillar cells. Hair cells protrude from the top of the Organ of Corti.
"A tectorial  membrane is held in place by a hinge-like mechanism on the side of the Organ of Corti and floats above the hair cells. As the basilar and tectorial membranes move up and down with the traveling wave, the hinge mechanism causes the tectorial membrane to move laterally over the hair cells. This lateral shearing motion bends the cilia atop the hair cells, pulls on the fine tip links, and opens the trap-door channels ."
"The influx of potassium and then calcium causes neurotransmitter release, which in turn causes an EPSP that initiates action potentials in the afferents of the VIIIth cranial nerve. Most of the afferent dendrites make synaptic contacts with the inner hair cells. Figure 12,6 looks down on the Organ of Corti."
"There are two types of hair cells, inner and outer. There is one row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells. Most of the afferent dendrites synapse on inner hair cells."
Most of efferent axons synapse on the outer hair cells. The outer hair cells are active. They move in response to sound and amplify the traveling wave.
"The outer hair cells also produce sounds that can be detected in the external auditory meatus with sensitive microphones. These internally generated sounds, termed otoacoustic emissions, are now used to screen newborns for hearing loss. Figure 12."
6 shows an immunofluorescent whole mount image of a neonatal mouse cochlea showing the three rows of outer hair cells and the single row of inner hair cells. The mature human cochlea would look approximately the same. Superimposed schematically-depicted neurons show the typical pattern of afferent connections.
Ninety-five percent of the VIIIth nerve afferents synapse on inner hair cells. Each inner hair cell makes synaptic connections with many afferents. Each afferent connects to only one inner hair cell.
About five percent of the afferents synapse on outer hair cells. These afferents travel a considerable distance along the basilar membrane away from their ganglion cells to synapse on multiple outer hair cells. Less than one percent  of the afferents synapse on multiple inner hair cells.

"Physical characteristics of the basilar membrane cause different frequencies to reach maximum amplitudes at different positions. Much as on a piano, high frequencies are at one end and low frequencies at the other. High frequencies are transduced at the base of the cochlea whereas low frequencies are transduced at the apex."
Figure 12. 7 illustrates the way in which the cochlea acts as a frequency analyzer. The cochlea codes the pitch of a sound by the place of maximal vibration.
"Note the position of the traveling wave at different frequencies. Select different frequencies by turning the dial. If audio on your computer is enabled, you will hear the sound you selected."
"Hearing loss at high frequencies is common. The average loss of hearing in American males is about a cycle per second per day . If you can't hear the high frequencies, it may be due to the speakers on your computer, but it is always worth thinking about hearing preservation."
"As you listen to these sounds, note that the high frequencies seem strangely similar. Think about cochlear-implant patients. These patients have lost hair-cell function."
"Their auditory nerve is stimulated by a series of implanted electrodes. The implant can only be placed in the base of the cochlea, because it is surgically impossible to thread the fine wires more than about 2/3 of a turn. Thus, cochlear implant patients probably experience something like high frequency sounds."
"Figure 12,8 shows the range of frequencies and intensities of sound to which the human auditory system responds. Our absolute threshold, the minimum level of sound that we can detect, is strongly dependent on frequency. At the level of pain, sound levels are about six orders of magnitude above the minimal audible threshold."
"Sound pressure level  is measured in decibels . Decibels are a logarithmic scale, with each 6 dB increase indicating a doubling of intensity. The perceived loudness of a sound is related to its intensity."
"Sound frequencies are measured in Hertz , or cycles per second. Normally, we hear sounds as low as 20 Hz and as high as 20,000 Hz. The frequency of a sound is associated with its pitch."
"Hearing is best at about 3-4 kHz. Hearing sensitivity decreases at higher and lower frequencies, but more so at higher than lower frequencies. High-frequency hearing is typically lost as we age."
"The neural code in the central auditory system is complex. Tonotopic organization is maintained throughout the auditory system. Tonotopic organization means that cells responsive to different frequencies are found in different places at each level of the central auditory system, and that there is a standard  relationship between this position and frequency."
"Each cell has a characteristic frequency . The CF is the frequency to which the cell is maximally responsive. A cell will usually respond to other frequencies, but only at greater intensities."
The neural tuning curve is a plot of the amplitude of sounds at various frequencies necessary to elicit a response from a central auditory neuron. The tuning curves for several different neurons are superimposed on the audibility curves in Figure 12. 8.
"The depicted neurons have CFs that vary from low to high frequencies . If we recorded from all auditory neurons, we would basically fill the area within the audibility curves. When sounds are soft they will stimulate only those few neurons with that CF, and thus neural activity will be confined to one set of fibers or cells at one particular place."
"As sounds get louder they stimulate other neurons, and the area of activity will increase. Graduate Students Sarah Baum, Heather Turner, Nadeeka Dias, Deepna Thakkar, Natalie Sirisaengtaksin and Jonathan Flynn of the Neuroscience Graduate Program at UTHealth Houston further explain the structures, functions and pathways of the auditory system in an animated video ""The Journey of Sound"". Connections in the central auditory system are complex, but a simple summary is that information proceeds from the Organ of Corti to spiral ganglion cells and the VIIIth nerve afferents in the ear, to the cochlear nuclei, many crossing in the trapezoid body to the superior olive in the brain stem."
"Then all ascending fibers stop in the inferior colliculus in the midbrain and the medial geniculate body in the thalamus, before reaching the cortex in the superior temporal gyrus. All auditory afferents synapse in the cochlear nuclei and in the thalamus. Beyond that simplification, second order fibers from the cochlear nuclei proceed rostrally in several different pathways."
"Afferents are generally distributed bilaterally so unilateral damage at any level does not usually result in deafness in either ear. Figure 13,1 shows a fiber traveling somewhat directly from the cochlea to the cortex. This is a fast acting system."
"These fibers synapse in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, and may function as a general warning . These fibers decussate and ascend in the lateral lemniscus to the inferior colliculus. Figure 13,2 shows the more numerous connections that work their way rostrally through a more detailed pathway."
"This slow acting system involves much more processing and may provide more detailed information about the sound, such as its location. These fibers synapse in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Fibers from the ventral cochlear nucleus synapse in the ipsilateral and contralateral superior olivary nucleus."
"Some fibers from the ventral cochlear nucleus cross the midline in the trapezoid body. Thus, cells in the superior olive receive inputs from both ears and are the first place in the central auditory system where binaural processing  is possible. The output of the superior olive travels in the lateral lemniscus."
Some nuclei within the lateral lemniscus further process the sound. Most of these afferents synapse in the inferior colliculus. All afferents then synapse in the medial geniculate body of the thalamus.
"Thalamic afferents reach the superior temporal gyrus through the sub-lenticular portion of the internal capsule. Figure 13,3 shows the same detail processing system as in Figure 13,2, only now with the more realistic situation of input from both ears. The two different patterns of dashed lines combine to form a solid line above the superior olive, meant to indicate the combination of monaural inputs into bilateral and binaural activation."
"Primary auditory cortex, or Herschel’s gyrus in insular cortex, is tonotopically organized. Afferents from this longitudinal strip on the superior temporal gyrus diverge to a wide variety of other cortical processing areas, including Wernicke’s area in the parietal lobe where speech is processed. Auditory afferents are tonotopically organized from the ear to the cortex."
"This starts with high frequencies transduced at the base of the cochlea, and low frequencies transduced at the apex . Click on the cochlea in Figure 13. 3 to see the color code of pitch, as if the cochlea were a piano."
"Low frequency fibers then pass in the central core of the VIIth nerve surrounded by high frequency fibers . This segregation of high and low frequencies persists throughout the CNS. As seen in Figure 13,3, low frequencies are more lateral in primary auditory cortex."
"In this chapter you will learn about how the visual system initiates the processing of external stimuli. The chapter will familiarize you with measures of visual sensation by discussing the basis of form perception, visual acuity, visual field representation, binocular fusion, and depth perception. An important aspect is the regional differences in our visual perception: the central visual field is color-sensitive, has high acuity vision, operates at high levels of illumination whereas the periphery is more sensitive at low levels of illumination, is relatively color insensitive, and has poor visual acuity."
"You will learn that the image is first projected onto a flattened sheet of photoreceptor cells that lie on the inner surface of the eye . The information gathered by millions of receptor cells is projected next onto millions of bipolar cells, which, in turn, send projects to retinal ganglion cells. These cells encode different aspects of the visual stimulus, and thus carry independent, parallel, streams of information about stimulus size, color, and movement to the visual thalamus."
"The condition of the visual system can be determined by examining various aspects of visual sensation. For example, the ability to detect and identify small objects  can be affected by disorders in the transparent media of the eye and/or visual nervous system. The inability to detect objects in specific areas of space  is often related to neural damage."
"The visual field is that area in space perceived when the eyes are in a fixed, static position looking straight ahead. The monocular visual field   is that area of space visible to one eye can be mapped parametrically Perimetry testing provides a detailed map of the visual field. The potential visual field is described as a hemisphere."
"However, it does not form a perfect hemisphere as the brow, nose and cheekbones obscure the view - most prominently in the nasal hemisphere is subdivided into two halves, the hemifields . A horizontal line drawn from 0° to 180° through center of the field defines the superior & inferior hemifields. A vertical line drawn from 90° to 270° through center point defines the left & right hemifields, which are often termed the nasal and temporal hemifields."
"may be further subdivided into quadrants: the superior and inferior nasal quadrants the superior and inferior temporal quadrants. contains a blind spot, a small area in which objects cannot be viewed which is located within the temporal hemifield. The monocular visual field  is determined with one eye covered."
The area of overlap of the visual field of one eye with that of the opposite eye is called the binocular field . All areas of the binocular visual field are “seen” by both eyes. The ability to locate objects in space and the ability to orient ourselves with respect to external objects are dependent upon the representation of visual space within the nervous system.
The clinical examination of the visual fields most commonly used is the confrontation field test. It defines the outer limits of our subjective visual space. Neurological disorders of the visual system can often be localized based on the area of blindness within the visual field.
"Visual acuity is the ability to detect and recognize small objects visually depends on the refractory  power of the eye's lens system and the cytoarchitecture of the retina. Visual acuity is  measured under high illumination the smallest size of a dark object in a light background that can be correctly identified In the clinical setting, an eye chart  is used to measure the patient’s visual acuity. consists of rows of black letters on a bright white background."
is used to measure visual acuity at a distance of 20 ft from the chart. reports visual acuity as the ratio of the eye chart distance  to the “normal distance” of the lowest row of letters correctly identified by the patient . Color vision is the ability to detect differences in the wavelengths of light is called color vision.
"Clinically it may be tested with an Ishihara chart: a chart with spots of different colors that are spatially organized to form numbers that differ for ``normal” and color-blind eyes. As mentioned above, the human has a trichromatic visual system, whereby visible colors can be created by a mixture of red, green and blue lights. The most common form of color blindness results in a confusion of red and green shades ."
"Most cases of color blindness result from an absent or defective gene responsible for producing the red or green photopigment . As these genes are located on the X chromosome, color blindness is more common in males than in females. Regional differences: There are regional differences in color sensation, visual acuity and low-illumination sensitivity within the visual field ."
A small “blind spot” is  located in the temporal hemifield  where objects cannot be seen. Vision in the visual field center  operates best under high illumination. has the greatest visual acuity and color sensitivity is ten times better than in the field periphery  represents the operation of the photopic  subsystem Vision in the peripheral visual field.
"is more sensitive to dim light operates under low illumination. has little color sensitivity and poor spatial acuity  represents the operation of the scotopic  subsystem. When a pencil is held an arm’s length away with both eyes open, most individuals will see a single object and recognize it as a pencil."
"However, if one rapidly closes each eye alternately ; you should see the pencil “jumping” from left to right as you alternate the eye closure. This is so because the image in each eye is slightly different : Notice that because each eye is located on either side of the nose, the viewing angle of each eye is slightly different - especially when viewing near objects . Although the area in space defined by the binocular visual field  represents corresponding areas of the monocular visual fields, the angle at which this space is viewed by each eye is slightly different."
"Consequently, the images of the corresponding  space are slightly different in each eye. The nervous system fuses these disparate binocular images to produce a single image . The process of producing a single image from the two disparate monocular images is called binocular fusion."
"Clinically, binocular fusion is tested by holding up one or two fingers in front of the patient and asking the patient  how many fingers they see. If the patient reports seeing four fingers when only two are presented, the patient is unable to produce binocular fusion. Binocular fusion permits the perception a single clear image and also provides extra cues for depth perception."
"That is, the binocular disparity between the two images is used by the nervous system to allow the perception of a three-dimensional world where the approximate distance of an object can be determined. The nervous system cannot fuse disparate binocular images when the disparity is too great. When corresponding areas of the normal binocular visual field are not in alignment , the nervous system cannot fuse the disparate images and gradually adapts by “ignoring” the image from the deviant eye."
"In fact, strabismus at birth, if uncorrected, may result in a form of central blindness, amblyopia, where the image from the deviant eye is no longer represented at cortical levels of the nervous system. The uncorrected, long-term amblyope is functionally blind in one eye and has poor depth perception. The transparent media of the eye function as a biconvex lens that refracts light entering the eye and focuses images of the external world onto the light sensitive retina."
"Recall that light rays will bend when passing from one transparent medium into another if the speed of light differs in the two media. However, parallel light rays will pass from air through a transparent body  without bending if the light rays are perpendicular to the lens surface . If the light strikes the lens surface at an angle, the light rays will be bent in a line perpendicular to the lens surface ."
"A @biconvex lens, which is functionally similar to the eye's lens system, is flat only at its center. The surface of the area surrounding the center is curved and not perpendicular to parallel light rays . Consequently, the curved surfaces of a biconvex lens will bend parallel light rays to focus an image of the object emitting the light a short distance behind the lens at its focal point."
The image formed is clear only if the curvature of the lens is symmetrical in all meridians and all divergent light rays emitted by a point source converge at the focal point. Note that the greater the curvature of the lens surface the greater is its refractive power and the closer is the focused image to the lens. Note also that the image formed is inverted and left-right reversed .
"The image formed by eye’s lens system is smaller than the object viewed, inverted , and reversed . As the image is inverted by the lens system, the superior  half of each eye’s visual field is projected onto the inferior  half of each eye’s retina. Also, as the lens produces a reversed image, the temporal half of each visual field is projected onto the nasal half of each eye’s retina1."
"Therefore, the temporal  hemifield of the left eye is projected onto the nasal  half of the left eye’s retina and the nasal  hemifield of right eye is projected onto temporal  half of the right eye’s retina. Consequently, the left hemifields of both eyes are projected onto the corresponding  halves of the two retinas. It is critical that you understand the relationship between the visual field and the retinal areas and realize that corresponding halves of the two monocular visual fields are imaged on corresponding halves of the two retinas."
These relationships form the neurological basis for understanding visual field defects. The eye must be able to change its refractive properties to focus images of both distant and nearby objects on the retina. Distant objects  emit or reflect light that can be focused on the retina in a normal relaxed eye .
"If a viewed object is brought closer to the eye, the light rays from the object diverge at a greater angle relative to the eye . Consequently, the nearer the object of view, the greater the angle of incidence of light rays on the cornea, and the greater the refractive power required to focus the light rays on the retina. The cornea has a fixed refractive power ."
"However, altering the tension of the zonules on the elastic lens capsule can alter the lens shape. The change in the refractive properties of the eye is called the accommodation or ""near point"" process. In the normal eye under resting  conditions, the ciliary muscles are relaxed and the zonules are under tension ."
"In this case, the lens is flattened, which reduces the refractive power of the lens to focus on distant objects. When an object is closer to the eye , accommodation occurs to affect “near vision”. The ciliary muscle contracts, pulling the ciliary processes toward the lens ."
This action releases tension on the zonules and the lens capsule. The reduced tension allows the lens to become more spherical . The increase in lens curvature increases the lens refractive power to focus on near objects.
"Consequently, as an object is moved closer to the viewer, his eyes accommodate to increase the lens curvature, which increases the refractive power of his eye . Presbyopia: In presbyopia, there is normal distance vision, but lens accommodation is reduced with age. With age, the lens loses its elasticity and becomes a relatively solid mass."
"During accommodation, the lens is unable to assume a more spherical shape and is unable to increase its refractive power for near vision . As a result, when an object is less than 30 ft. away from the presbyopic viewer, the image is focused somewhere behind the retina."
"A convex lens  is used to correct the presbyopic eye . These lenses refract the light rays so they strike the surface of the cornea at a smaller angle. However, because the corrective lens increases the refractive power, the presbyope with convex lenses will have problems with distance vision."
"Consequently, the corrective lenses are often half lenses  which allow the presbyope to view objects in the distance unimpeded by the convex lens. Hyperopia: In hyperopia , the refractive power of the eye’s lens system is too weak or the eyeball too short. When viewing distant objects, the image is focused at a point beyond the retina."
"The young hyperope can compensate by using lens accommodation, i. e. , increase the refractive power of the eye’s lens system ."
"We call the hyperope ""far-sighted""  because the power of accommodation used for distance vision cannot be used for near vision. As the hyperope ages and becomes presbyopic, the power of accommodation is diminished. Consequently, the middle aged hyperope may have a limited range  of vision."
"To correct this effect of aging, the refractive power of the eye is increased with convex lenses . Myopia: In myopia , the refractive power of the eye’s lens system is too strong or the eyeball too long. When viewing distant objects, the image is focused at a point in front of retina."
"The uncorrected myopic eye is ""near-sighted"" because it can focus unaided on near objects. That is, the young myope will see distant objects as blurred, poorly defined images but can see nearby small objects clearly . For distance vision, the refractive power of the myopic eye lens system is corrected with concave lenses that diverge the light rays entering the eye ."
"Note that as the power of accommodation diminishes with age, near vision is also affected in the presbyopic-myopic eye. The mature myope may require bifocals, the upper half of the lens diverging light rays for distance vision and the lower half with no or low converging power for near vision. Astigmatism: An astigmatism results when the cornea surface does not resemble the surface of a sphere ."
"In an eye with astigmatism, the image of distant and near objects cannot be focused on the retina . Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical lens having a curvature that corrects for the corneal astigmatism. The cylindrical lens directs light waves through the astigmatic cornea to focus a single, clear image on the retina."
"You will now learn about the retinal neurons and the laminar structure of the retina, and the ways in which the light-sensitive receptors of the eye convert the image projected onto the retina into neural responses. The light sensitive retina forms the innermost layer of the eye . The retina covers the choroid and extends anteriorly to just behind the ciliary body."
"The retina consists of neurons and supporting cells. The retina is derived from the neural tube and is, therefore, part of central nervous system. It consists of two parts, the retinal pigment epithelium, which separates the middle, choroid coat of the eyeball from the other innermost component and the neural retina  – the dark pigments within the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid coat function to absorb light passing through the receptor layer, thus reducing light scatter and image distortion within the eye."
"The neural retina contains five types of neurons : the visual receptor cells , the horizontal cells, the bipolar cells, the amacrine cells, and the retinal ganglion cells. The retina is a laminated structure consisting of alternating layers of cell bodies and cell processes . The innermost layers are located nearest the vitreous chamber, whereas the outermost layers are located adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid."
"The most important layers, progressing from the outer to inner layers, are:  the retinal pigment epithelium, which provides critical metabolic and supportive functions to the photoreceptors; the receptor layer, which contains the light sensitive outer segments of the photoreceptors; the outer nuclear layer, which contains the photoreceptor cell bodies; the outer plexiform layer, where the photoreceptor, horizontal and bipolar cells synapse; the inner nuclear layer, which contains the horizontal, bipolar and amacrine cell bodies; the inner plexiform layer, where the bipolar, amacrine and retinal ganglion cells synapse; the retinal ganglion cell layer, which contains the retinal ganglion cell bodies; and the optic nerve layer, which contains the ganglion cell axons traveling to the optic disc. Notice that light passing through the cornea, lens and vitreous must pass through most of the retinal layers before reaching the light-sensitive portion of the photoreceptor; the outer segment in the receptor layer. Notice also that in the region of the fovea where the image of the central visual field center is focused, the retina consists of fewer layers : thereby minimizing the obstacles to forming a clear image on the fovea."
"The area around the fovea, the surrounding macula, is thicker because it contains the cell bodies and processes of retinal neurons receiving information from the receptors in the fovea. The optic disc is formed by the retinal ganglion cell axons that are exiting the retina. It is located nasal to the fovea ."
"This region of the retina is devoid of receptor cells and composed predominantly by the optic nerve layer. Consequently, it is the structural basis for the 'blind spot"" in the visual field. The human has two types of photoreceptors: the rods and cones ."
"They are distinguished structurally by the shapes of their outer segments. The photopigments of the rods and cones also differ. The rod outer segment disks contain the photopigment rhodopsin, which absorbs a wide bandwidth of light."
"The cones differ in the color of light their photopigments absorbs: one type of photopigment absorbs red light, another green light, and a third blue light. As each cone receptor contains only one of the three types of cone photopigment, there are three types of cones; red, green or blue. Each cone responds best to a specific color of light, whereas the rods respond best to white light2."
"The rod and cone photopigments also differ in illumination sensitivity; rhodopsin breaks down at lower light levels than that required to breakdown cone photopigments. Consequently, the rods are more sensitive - at least at low levels of illumination. The human visual system has two subsystems that operate at different light energy levels."
"The scotopic, dark-adapted system operates at low levels of illumination, whereas the photopic, light-adapted system operates at high levels of illumination. Rods are responsible for the initiation of the scotopic visual process. Rods  contain the photopigment rhodopsin, which breaks down when exposed to a wide bandwidth of light ."
"Rhodopsin is also more sensitive to light and reacts at lower light levels than the color sensitive  cone pigments. have longer outer segments, more outer segment disks and, consequently, contain more photopigment. are more sensitive to light and function at scotopic  levels of illumination."
"dominate in the peripheral retina , which is color insensitive, has poor acuity , but is sensitive to low levels of illumination. Cones are responsible for the initiation of the photopic visual process. Cones  contain photopigments that breakdown in the presence of a limited bandwidth of light ."
are color sensitive. are less sensitive to light and require high  illumination levels. are concentrated in the fovea  in the fovea have image of the central visual field projected on them.
"in the fovea are responsible for photopic, light-adapted vision  in the central visual field . Biochemical processes in the photoreceptors participate in dark and light adaptation. Notice when you enter a darkened room after spending time in daylight, it takes many minutes before you are able to see objects in the dim light."
"This slow increase in light sensitivity is called the dark-adaptation process and is related to the rate of regeneration of photopigments and to the intracellular concentration of calcium3. A contrasting, but faster, process occurs in high levels of illumination. When you are fully dark-adapted, exposure to bright light is at first blinding  and is followed rapidly by a return of sight."
"This phenomenon, light adaptation, allows the cone response to dominate over rod responses at high illumination. The photoreceptors exhibit a fairly high basal release of glutamate. When light strikes the photoreceptor cell, it initiates a biochemical process in the cell that reduces the release of glutamate from its axon terminal."
"The glutamate, in turn, affects the activity of the bipolar and horizontal cells, which synapse with the photoreceptor. The bipolar cells, in turn, synapse with amacrine and retinal ganglion cells. It is the axons of the retinal ganglion cells that exit the eye as the optic nerve and terminate in the brain."
"Notice that the direct pathway for the transmission of visual information from the eye to the brain includes only the receptor cell, bipolar cell and ganglion cell. The horizontal cells modulate the synaptic activity of receptor cells and, thereby, indirectly affect the transmission of visual information by bipolar cells. Similarly the amacrine cells modulate the synaptic activity of the retinal bipolar and ganglion cells, thereby affecting the transmission of visual information by the ganglion cells."
"Within the outer plexiform layer of the retina, approximately 125 million photoreceptor cells synapse with approximately 10 million bipolar cells. A smaller number of horizontal cells also synapse with the photoreceptor cells within the outer plexiform layer of the retina. The bipolar and horizontal cells respond to the glutamate released by the photoreceptor cells4."
Bipolar cells do not generate action potentials. respond to the release of glutamate from photoreceptors with graded potentials . Bipolar cells differ based on their responses to photoreceptor stimulation.
There are at least two types of bipolar cells based on their responses to glutamate. The off bipolar cells are depolarized by glutamate. The on bipolar cells are hyperpolarized by glutamate.
The two bipolar cell types have different functional properties. The off bipolar cells function to detect dark objects in a lighter background. The on bipolar cells function to detect light objects in a darker background.
The stimulus condition that produces a depolarizing response from a bipolar cell is used to name the bipolar cell type. An off bipolar cell depolarizes when the photoreceptors that synapse with it are in the dark . An on bipolar cell depolarizes when the photoreceptors that synapse with are in the light .
"Note that the depolarization of the on bipolar cell does not result from excitation of the presynaptic cell but rather from a reduction of the inhibitory action ofBipolar Cell Receptive Field: The receptive field of a bipolar cell is defined anatomically by the location and distribution of receptor cells with which it makes synaptic contact. Each cone bipolar cell makes direct synaptic contact with a circumscribed patch of cone receptors, which may be as few as one foveal cone. Consequently, the receptive fields of bipolar cells synapsing with cones in the fovea are extremely small and are color sensitive."
"The cone bipolars may be hyperpolarized or depolarized by glutamate and, consequently, may be on-type or off-type bipolar cells. Each rod bipolar cell may make synaptic contact with a few to fifty or more of rod receptor cells. Consequently, the rod bipolar cell receptive field is relatively large and color insensitive."
"All rod bipolar cells are hyperpolarized by glutamate and, consequently, are on-type bipolar cells exclusively. The bipolar cell receptive field is also defined physiologically as the retinal area which when exposed to light produces a response  in the bipolar cell. Bipolar cells have concentric receptive fields."
"Light directed on the photoreceptor that synapse with a bipolar cell produces a response from the bipolar cell called the center response . In contrast, light directed on immediately surrounding receptors produce the opposite response . When both the center and surrounding receptor cells are illuminated with light, the on bipolar cell response to stimulation of the center receptors is reduced by stimulation of the surround receptors ."
"Consequently, the strongest on bipolar cell response is produced when the stimulus is a light spot encircled by a dark ring. For the off bipolar cell, a dark spot encircled by a light ring produces maximal depolarization. Within the outer plexiform layer, the photoreceptor cells make both presynaptic and postsynaptic contact with horizontal cells."
"The horizontal cells have large receptive fields involving presynaptic  contact with a small group of photoreceptors and postsynaptic  contact with a larger group of surrounding photoreceptor cells. By controlling the responses of their “center” photoreceptors , the horizontal cells indirectly produce the bipolar cell receptive field surround effect. The surround effect produced by the horizontal cell is weaker than the center effect."
"The surround effect, produced by the horizontal cells, enhances brightness contrasts to produce sharper images, to make an object appear brighter or darker depending on the background and to maintain these contrasts under different illumination levels. Within the inner plexiform layer, the axon terminals of bipolar cells  synapse on the dendritic processes of amacrine cells and ganglion cells. As in most neurons, depolarization results in neurotransmitter release by the bipolar cell at its axon terminals."
"Most bipolar cells release glutamate, which is excitatory to most ganglion cells . The amacrine cells may synapse with bipolar cells, other amacrine cells or ganglion cells. It is the axons of the retinal ganglion cells  that exit the eye to form the optic nerve and deliver visual information to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and to other diencephalic and midbrain structures."
"Ganglion Cell Response Properties. The retinal ganglion cells are the final retinal elements in the direct pathway from the eye to the brain. Because they must carry visual information some distance from the eye, they posses voltage-gated sodium channels in their axonal membranes and generate action potentials when they are depolarized by the glutamate released by the bipolar cells."
"The off bipolar cell  will depolarize when it is dark on its center cones and will therefore release glutamate when it is dark on the center of its receptive field. This will result in the depolarization of the retinal ganglion cells with which the off bipolar synapses and in the production of action potentials  by these ganglion cells . Consequently, the retinal ganglion cells that synapse with off bipolar cells will have off-center/on-surround receptive fields and are called off ganglion cells."
"The on bipolar cell  will depolarize when there is light on its center cones and will therefore release glutamate when it is light on the center of its receptive field. This will result in the depolarization of the retinal ganglion cells with which the on bipolar synapses and in the production of action potentials  by these ganglion cells . Consequently, the retinal ganglion cells that synapse with on bipolar cells will have on-center/off-surround receptive fields and are called on ganglion cells."
"In short, the receptive fields of the bipolar cells with which the retinal ganglion cell synapses determine the receptive field configuration of a retinal ganglion cell. The retinal ganglion cells provide information important for detecting the shape and movement of objects. In the primate eye, there are two major types of retinal ganglion cells, Type M and Type P cells, that process information about different stimulus properties."
"Type P retinal ganglion cells are color-sensitive object detectors. The P ganglion cell  outnumber the M-ganglion cells, by approximately 100 to 1 in the primate retina makes synaptic contact with one to a few cone bipolars that are innervated by cone receptors in the macula fovea is color sensitive has a small concentric receptive field produces a sustained, slowly adapting response that lasts as long as a stimulus is centered on its receptive field. produces weak responses to stimuli that move across its receptive field."
"The slowly adapting response of the Type P retinal ganglion cell is best suited for signaling the presence, color and duration of a visual stimulus and is poor for signaling stimulus movement. Type M retinal ganglion cells are color-insensitive motion detectors. The M ganglion cell  is much larger than P ganglion cells synapses with many bipolar cells is color insensitive has a large concentric receptive field is more sensitive to small center-surround brightness differences responds with a transient, rapidly adapting response to a maintained stimulus."
"responds maximally, with high discharge rates, to stimuli moving across its receptive field. The rapidly adapting responses of Type M ganglion cells are best suited for signaling temporal variations in, and the movement of, a stimulus. The axons of the M and P retinal ganglion cells travel in the retina optic nerve fiber layer to the optic disc where they exit the eye."
"Most of the axons travel to and terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Amacrine cells synapse with bipolar cells and ganglion cells and are similar to horizontal cells in providing lateral connections between similar types of neurons 5. They differ from horizontal cells, however, in also providing ‘’vertical” links between bipolar and ganglion cells."
Amacrine cell types. There are 20 or more types of amacrine cells based on their morphology and neurochemistry. The roles of three types have been identified.
"One type  is responsible for producing the movement sensitive  response of the Type M ganglion cells. enhances the center-surround effect in ganglion cell receptive fields. connects rod bipolar cells to cone bipolar cells, thus allowing ganglion cells to respond to the entire range of light levels, from scotopic to photopic."
Low convergence of cones to cone bipolar cells and low convergence of cone bipolar cells to P-retinal ganglion cells produce high visual acuity in the central visual field. Recall that  visual acuity and color vision are greatest in the central visual field. the image of the central visual field is projected onto the fovea.
"the cones are concentrated in the fovea, whereas the rods predominate in the peripheral retina. there is low convergence of foveal cones onto macular bipolar cells, as low as one cone receptor to one bipolar cell. In addition, the cones in the fovea are of smaller diameter than those in the periphery of the retina, which allows for a greater packing density of foveal cones."
"The high packing density of cones and the low convergence of cones onto bipolar cells in the macula support higher visual acuity in the central visual field. Consequently, the foveal cones, macular bipolar cells and the P-retinal ganglion cells are responsible for photopic, light-adapted vision in the central visual field. In contrast, the higher convergence of the rods onto peripherally located bipolar cells and of peripheral bipolar cells onto amacrine cells forms the basis for the poor visual acuity but high light sensitivity of scotopic vision."
The chemical and physical integrity of the retina is essential for normal visual function. Abnormalities in the blood supply and retinal pigment epithelium result in retinal dysfunctions. Vitamin A deficiency can cause permanent blindness.
"An adequate supply of photopigments is necessary to sustain photoreceptors. The supply of all-trans retinal as a photopigment breakdown product is insufficient to maintain adequate photopigment production. Vitamin A can be oxidized into all-trans retinal, and is, therefore, critical in the synthesis of photopigment."
"In the eye, it is the retinal pigment epithelium that stores vitamin A. The retinal pigment epithelium is also the site of the oxidization of vitamin A into all-trans retinal and conversion of all-trans retinal into 11-cis-retinal. Vitamin A cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested."
"It is found in blood and stored in the liver and retinal pigment epithelium. Vitamin A deficiency, which can result from liver damage , produces degeneration of photoreceptors with visual symptoms first presenting as “night blindness” . Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disorder in which there is a gradual and progressive failure to maintain the receptor cells."
"One form involves the production of defective opsin that normally combines with 11-cis retinal to form rhodopsin. Consequently, the rods do not contain sufficient rhodopsin and do not function as the low illumination receptors. A symptom of this condition is “night blindness” and loss of peripheral vision."
"In this form of retinitis pigmentosa, the cones receptors function normally and central vision remains intact. Other forms of retinitis pigmentosa that affect the cones may progress to destroy central vision. Macular Degeneration."
"The leading cause of blindness in the elderly is age-related macular degeneration. The dry form of macular degeneration involves intraocular proliferation of cells in the macular area . In the wet form of macular degeneration, the capillaries of the choroid coat invade the macular area and destroy receptor cells and neurons."
"In both forms, the visual loss is in the central visual field and the patient will complain of blurred vision and difficulty reading. Laser surgery is the most common treatment for the wet form but has the disadvantage of destroying normal retinal cells. It also may not be effective in preventing cell proliferation following treatment."
"Retinal detachment. When the neural retina is torn away from the retinal pigment epithelium , there is a loss of vision in the area of detachment. The loss of vision results because the neural retina is dependent on the retinal pigment epithelium for 11-cis retinal, nutrients and photoreceptor integrity."
"The retinal pigment epithelium supplies glucose and essential ions to the neural retina, helps support the photoreceptor cell outer segment, removes outer segment disks shed by the receptor cells, and converts retinol and stores vitamin A for photopigment resynthesis. Lasers may be used to weld the detachment to prevent it from increasing in size. However, the detached and welded areas are functionally blind."
Diabetic retinopathy. The pathological process in diabetic retinopathy involves microaneurysms and punctate hemorrhages in the retina. The tiny swollen blood vessels and/or bleeding in the underlying choroid coat damage the receptor cells and retinal neurons and result in blindness in the regions affected.
"Lasers may be used to seal swollen and/or leaking blood vessels. This chapter described the stimulus  properties that are important for the visual perception of our external environment, such as color, brightness, color and brightness contrasts , visual field representation, binocular fusion and depth perception. Remember that there are regional differences in visual perception: the central visual field is color-sensitive, has high acuity vision and operates at high levels of illumination ."
"In contrast, the visual field periphery is more sensitive at low levels of illumination, is relatively color insensitive and has poor visual acuity . The chapter also described how the lens system of the eye produces an image on the retina of light emitted by or reflected off objects in space. The image is a smaller, inverted, and reversed picture of the object."
"Keep in mind that the image projected onto the retina is, in fact, projected onto a flattened sheet of receptor cells that line the inner surface of the eye. The following chapter will describe the function of the visual receptors and other retinal neurons in converting the visual image into an array of neural activity. The chapter also reviewed the retinal neurons and the laminar structure of the retina."
"The image projected onto the retina is distributed over a mosaic of photoreceptors. Light energy projected onto each photoreceptor is converted into receptor membrane potential changes by a process that involves photosensitive pigments and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels in the photoreceptor outer segment. The phototransduction process converts light energy into photoreceptor membrane potential changes that produce a chemical signal , which results in membrane potential changes in the postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells."
"The receptor substrate for scotopic and photopic vision lies in differences between the rod and cone receptors. In the primate eye, the information gathered by 125 million receptor cells converges on 10 million bipolar cells, which, in turn, converge on 1 million retinal ganglion cells. The degree of convergence from receptors to bipolar cell and bipolar cells to ganglion cell differs regionally within the retina."
"In the peripheral retina, the convergence can be fifty or more rod receptors to one bipolar cell, which increases the sensitivity to dim lights but decreases the spatial acuity of the peripheral bipolar cell. In addition, these peripheral bipolar cells are color insensitive. The M-ganglion cells receive input from many peripheral bipolar cells, have large receptive fields, are sensitive to small brightness contrasts and are color insensitive."
"They also generate transient responses and are uniquely sensitive to changes in illumination levels and movement. In contrast, the bipolar cells in the macula synapse with few foveal cone receptors, which maintain the spatial resolution of the densely packed cones. Such macular bipolar cells have small receptive field centers, are color sensitive but must operate at high illumination levels."
"Each P-ganglion cell synapses with few macular bipolar cells and is color sensitive, but less sensitive to dim “white” light and to small brightness contrasts. The P ganglion cells have smaller receptive fields than the M ganglion cells and respond with sustained discharges to maintained stimuli. As the M ganglion cells and P ganglion cells respond to different aspects of the visual stimulus, they are described to be encoding and carrying independent, parallel, streams  of information about stimulus size, color, and movement."
"The visual system is unique as much of visual processing occurs outside the brain within the retina of the eye. The previous chapter described how the light-sensitive receptors of the eye convert the image projected onto the retina into spatially distributed neural activity in the first neurons of the visual pathway . Within the retina, the receptors synapse with bipolar and horizontal cells, which establish the basis for brightness and color contrasts."
"In turn, the bipolar cells  synapse with retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells, which enhance contrast effects that support form vision and establish the basis for movement detection. The information from the eye is carried by the axons of the retinal ganglion cells  to the midbrain and diencephalon. This chapter will provide more information about visual pathway organization and the visual processing that occurs within the brain."
"As noted previously in the somatosensory sections, all sensory information must reach the cerebral cortex to be perceived and, with one exception, reach the cortex by way of the thalamus. In the case of the visual system, the thalamic nucleus is the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is the striate cortex of the occipital lobe. The axons of the 3° visual afferents  form the optic nerve fiber layer of the retina on their course to the optic disc."
"At the optic disc, the 3° visual afferents exit the eye and form the optic nerve. The fibers of the optic nerve that originate from ganglion cells in the nasal half of the retina  decussate in the optic chiasm to the opposite optic tract . Consequently, each optic tract contains retinal ganglion cell axons that originate in the nasal half of the contralateral retina and the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina."
"Recall that the ipsilateral temporal hemiretina and the contralateral nasal hemiretina have projected on them the images of corresponding halves of their visual fields. For example, the temporal  hemiretina of left eye and the nasal  hemiretina of right eye both have projected on them the right halves of their respective visual fields. Consequently, each optic tract has within it axons representing the contralateral half of the visual field."
"The axons in the optic tract terminate in four nuclei within the brain :  the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus - for visual perception; the superior colliculus of the midbrain - for control of eye movements; the pretectum of the midbrain - for control of the pupillary light reflex; and the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus - for control of diurnal rhythms and hormonal changes. The vast majority of optic tract fibers terminate on neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus . Like the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus is a laminated structure, in this case, with six principal layers of cells ."
"The largest cells form the deepest two  layers Smaller cells form the upper four  layers Thin layers of the smallest cells  are interposed between these principal layers. The optic tract fibers  from each eye synapse in different layers of the LGN. Consequently, each LGN neuron responds to stimulation of one eye only."
The functional properties of LGN neurons are similar to those of retinal ganglion cells. The LGN neurons are monocular  and have concentric  receptive fields. The LGN neurons are segregated into three major groups:  The neurons in the magnocellular layers  process M-retinal ganglion cell inputs behave like M-retinal ganglion cells have relatively large center-surround receptive fields are color insensitive are most sensitive to movement of visual stimuli The neurons in the parvocellular layers  process P-retinal ganglion cell inputs behave like P-retinal ganglion cells have relatively small center-surround receptive fields are color sensitive are well suited for detecting contrasts that form the basis for shape/form discrimination.
"A third group, the koniocellular neurons  process P-retinal ganglion cell inputs behave like P-retinal ganglion cells have the smallest concentric receptive fields have stronger color sensitivity than P-retinal ganglion cells are well suited for detecting colors that aid in shape/form discrimination. The axons of these different types of LGN neurons terminate in different layers or sublayers of the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortical receiving area is in the occipital lobe."
"The primary visual cortex is characterized by a unique layered appearance in Nissl stained tissue. Consequently, it is called the striate cortex. It includes the calcarine cortex, which straddles the calcarine fissure, and extends around the occipital pole to include the lateral aspect of the caudal occipital lobe ."
"The LGN neurons  send their axons in the internal capsule to the occipital lobe where they terminate in the striate cortex . The LGN axons fan out as the optic radiations of the internal capsule and travel through the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The LGN axons in the sublenticular segment of the optic radiations pass below the lenticular nuclei, loop around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle within the temporal lobe and swing posteriorly to form Meyer’s loop."
"Once around the inferior horn, they travel up to the inferior bank of the striate cortex, where they terminate. The LGN axons in the retrolenticular segment of the internal capsule pass superiorly through the parietal lobe to end in the superior bank of the striate cortex. The striate cortex  is considered to be the primary visual cortex or V1, as  most LGN axons terminate in V1 all V1 neurons respond to visual stimuli exclusively ablating V1 results in blindness electrical stimulation of V1 elicits visual sensations."
"The striate cortex is involved in the initial cortical processing of all visual information necessary for visual perception and its damage results in loss of vision in the contralesional hemifield. The color , shape  and movement  information from the thalamus are sent to different neurons within V1 for further processing in V1 and then sent onto different areas of the extrastriate visual cortex. V1 blob cells: Some V1 cells resemble kLGN neurons."
"They are  monocular . color sensitive. characterized by small, concentric receptive fields."
"found in clusters . a special target of the kLGN axon terminals. The P-stream information processed by the V1 blob cells is used in color perception, color discrimination and the learning and memory of the color of objects."
"The blob cells are the ""color"" processing cells of V1. V1 interblob cells: Most V1 interblob cells are  binocular . not color sensitive."
characterized by elongated  receptive fields that may or may not have a center-surround type organization. found around the clusters of color-sensitive V1 blob cells. exhibit ocular dominance .
"exhibit orientation specificity . Location specific V1 interblob cells: One subset of V1 interblob cells responds best when the stimulus is in a specific location of the receptive field . The P-stream information processed by the V1 interblob cells that exhibit orientation and location specificity but are not motion sensitive is used in object perception, discrimination, learning and memory or in spatial orientation."
"These interblob cells are the ""shape/form"" processing cells and the ""location"" processing cells of V1. Movement sensitive V1 interblob cells: A second subset of interblob cells respond best to moving stimuli  without a preference for the direction of movement. Direction specific V1 interblob cells: A third subset displays a preference for movement in a particular direction ."
"The M-stream of information processed by the motion sensitive V1 interblob cells is used to detect object movement and direction/velocity of movement and to guide eye movements. These motion-sensitive interblob cells are the ""motion detecting” cells of V1. Extrastriate Visual Cortex."
"The extrastriate cortex includes all of the occipital lobe areas surrounding the primary visual cortex . The extrastriate cortex in non-human primates has been subdivided into as many as three functional areas, V2, V3, and V4. The primary visual cortex, V1, sends input to extrastriate cortex and to visual association cortex."
"The information from the “color”, “shape/form”, ""location"" and “motion” detecting V1, neurons are sent to different areas of the extrastriate cortex . Damage to extrastriate cortex does not result in a “simple loss of vision”; rather it results in higher order visual perceptual deficits including the failure to recognize objects, colors and/or movement of objects. Visual Association Cortex."
"The visual association cortex extends anteriorly from the extrastriate cortex to encompass adjacent areas of the posterior parietal lobe and much of the posterior temporal lobe . In most cases, these areas receive visual input via the extrastriate cortex, which sends color, shape/form, location and motion information to different areas of the visual association cortex . The Dorsal Stream: The neurons in the parietal association cortex and superior and middle temporal visual association cortex  have binocular receptive fields and process P-channel information about object location and M-channel information about object movement."
"These dorsally located visual association neurons are responsible for producing our sense of  spatial orientation binocular fusion/depth perception the location, the movement and the movement direction and velocity of objects in space. The dorsal stream processes information about the “where” of the visual stimulus . Damage the dorsal visual association cortex results in deficits in spatial orientation, motion detection and in guidance of visual tracking eye movements."
"The Ventral Stream: The neurons in the inferior temporal visual association cortex  process P-channel information about object color and form. These ventrally located visual association neurons are responsible for processing information necessary for our abilities to  recognize objects and colors read text and learn and remember visual objects  This ventral stream processes information about the “what” of the visual stimulus . Damage to the inferior visual association cortex produces deficits in complex visual perception tasks, attention and learning/memory."
"The topographic  relationships of retinal neurons are maintained throughout the visual system, which preserves the retinotopic map of the visual world. That is, the retina is mapped onto the LGN and striate cortex in an organized  fashion. Consequently, neighboring parts of retina project to neighboring parts of LGN and neighboring parts of LGN project to neighboring parts of the striate cortex."
This retinotopic organization in the visual pathway results in a spatial representation of the visual field in the LGN and visual cortex. You should recall the following regarding the spatial representation of the retinal image within the visual pathway. The optic image on the retina is upside-down and left-right reversed.
"The monocular visual fields of the two eyes overlap partially to form the binocular visual field . The temporal hemiretina of one eye and the nasal hemiretina of the other eye have projected on them the images of corresponding halves of their visual fields . For example, the temporal  hemiretina of left eye and the nasal  hemiretina of right eye both have projected on them the right half of the visual fields of each eye."
"Beyond the optic chiasm, the corresponding visual hemifields of the two eyes are represented in the contralateral side of the visual pathway . For example, the left hemifield of both eyes are represented in the right optic tract, right lateral geniculate nucleus, right optic radiations and right striate cortex. The fibers of the optic radiation fan out into the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes on their course to the striate cortex."
"Those forming the sublenticular optic radiations carry information about the superior hemifield, whereas those forming the retrolenticular optic radiations carry information about the inferior hemifield . The optic radiation fibers traveling the most direct course back to the striate cortex carry information about the central visual field. There are many more receptor cells in the fovea and many more bipolar and ganglion cells in the macula than in the periphery of the retina."
"Consequently, the central visual field is disproportionately represented in the visual system. That is, more visual receptors, more optic nerve fibers and more LGN and cortical neurons are involved in processing and carrying information about that portion of the retinal image representing the center of the visual field. The topographic  relationships of retinal neurons are maintained throughout the visual system, which preserves the retinotopic map of the visual world."
"That is, the retina is mapped onto the LGN and striate cortex in an organized  fashion. Consequently, neighboring parts of retina project to neighboring parts of LGN and neighboring parts of LGN project to neighboring parts of the striate cortex. This retinotopic organization in the visual pathway results in a spatial representation of the visual field in the LGN and visual cortex."
Spatial Representation of the Retinal Image  You should recall the following regarding the spatial representation of the retinal image within the visual pathway. The optic image on the retina is upside-down and left-right reversed. The monocular visual fields of the two eyes overlap partially to form the binocular visual field .
"The temporal hemiretina of one eye and the nasal hemiretina of the other eye have projected on them the images of corresponding halves of their visual fields . For example, the temporal  hemiretina of left eye and the nasal  hemiretina of right eye both have projected on them the right half of the visual fields of each eye. Beyond the optic chiasm, the corresponding visual hemifields of the two eyes are represented in the contralateral side of the visual pathway ."
"For example, the left hemifield of both eyes are represented in the right optic tract, right lateral geniculate nucleus, right optic radiations and right striate cortex. The fibers of the optic radiation fan out into the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes on their course to the striate cortex. Those forming the sublenticular optic radiations carry information about the superior hemifield, whereas those forming the retrolenticular optic radiations carry information about the inferior hemifield ."
"The optic radiation fibers traveling the most direct course back to the striate cortex carry information about the central visual field. There are many more receptor cells in the fovea and many more bipolar and ganglion cells in the macula than in the periphery of the retina. Consequently, the central visual field is disproportionately represented in the visual system."
"That is, more visual receptors, more optic nerve fibers and more LGN and cortical neurons are involved in processing and carrying information about that portion of the retinal image representing the center of the visual field. Figure 15,11 illustrates perimetry test results for the two eyes of someone with normal vision. The bottom panel of Figure 15."
"11 is a simplified illustration of the monocular visual fields used in the following examples of visual field defects. A visual field defect provides clues to the structure affected. That is, the area of visual field loss and eye exhibiting the visual field loss offer clues about the site of the damage."
"The following examples of visual field losses should help you determine how well you can utilize what you have learned thus far about the visual system. Symptoms: The patient is having his semiannual physical examination. As he is diabetic, the physician examines his retinas and performs a confrontation test of his visual fields."
An abnormality is detected in his left fundus  but the confrontational field test detects nothing. Perimetry testing is requested. Perimetry Test Results: The results indicate the right eye's visual field is normal and that there is peripheral a scotoma  in the left eye's temporal hemifield .
"Side & Retinotopicity of damage: The visual loss  is limited to the left eye is in the temporal  hemifield is associated with retinal abnormalities in the nasal hemiretina of the left eye So you conclude that the visual defect involves  retinal damage in the left eye damage located in the nasal half of the left retina  damage related to the patient's diabetes - diabetic retinopathy. Retinal Damage: A defect involving only the visual field of one eye indicates possible damage in the retina or optic nerve. If the visual loss is confined to one eye, it is called a monocular visual field defect."
"Often retinal lesions are small and do not follow the boundaries of the visual field quadrants. Such a visual field disorder is called a scotoma. A retinal visual field defect is most severe when vision in the central field is affected, as in the case of macular degeneration."
"In macular degeneration, the patient will report difficulty reading and seeing clearly and visual field testing will demonstrate that the patient has a central scotoma . Symptoms: The patient complains of a sudden headache and loss of vision in his left eye. Ophthalmoscope examination does not reveal abnormalities in the left eye1."
"However, confrontation testing indicates a severe loss of vision in the left eye. The patient is referred for immediate neuroradiographic tests and perimetry testing. Perimetry Test Results: The results indicate the right eye's visual field is normal and that there is a large visual loss encompassing nearly all of the left eye's visual field ."
"Side & Retinotopicity of damage: The visual loss  does not appear to relate to changes in the retina of the left eye, is limited to the left eye, encompasses nearly the entire the visual field of the left eye. So, you conclude that the visual defect is  retrobulbar  , probably limited to optic nerve damage . Neural imaging results indicate an aneurysm on the left ophthalmic artery, which is compressing the left optic nerve ."
"Compression of the nerve prevents action potentials from the retina to travel to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Long-term compression may damage the nerve, however, of greater concern is the potential rupture of the aneurysm, which could cause extensive brain damage. Optic Nerve Damage: Each optic nerve contains the axons of retinal ganglion cells from one eye, e."
"g. , the right nerve from the right eye. Damage to one optic nerve will produce a monocular visual field defect."
"Destruction of one optic nerve  will result in the total loss of vision in the ipsilesional eye. Symptoms: At his annual physical exam, the patient complains of a general malaise and changes in his vision that he noticed while playing soccer. He said he was often ""blindsided"" on the playing field because he ""couldn't see players approaching him from the side""."
Ophthalmoscope examination does not reveal abnormalities in either eye2. Confrontation field testing indicates a constriction of the temporal hemifields of both eyes. The patient is referred for neuroradiographic tests and perimetry testing.
"Perimetry Test Results: The results indicate a bitemporal hemianopia, i. e. , loss of vision in the temporal hemifields of both eyes ."
"Side & Retinotopicity of damage: The visual loss  is not related to changes in the retina of either eye, involves vision in both eyes, encompasses only the temporal hemifields. You conclude that the visual field defect is related to damage that  is retrobulbar , involves the optic chiasm . Neural imaging results  indicate a pituitary adenoma that is compressing the optic chiasm."
"Compression of the decussating nerve fibers prevents action potentials from the nasal hemiretina to reach the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. As the tumor grows larger it will crush the optic chiasm, destroying it and eventually compromising the remaining optic nerve fibers. Optic Chiasm Damage: The fibers of the optic nerve that originate from ganglion cells in the nasal half of the retina decussate in the optic chiasm to the opposite optic tract ."
"The crossing fibers of the optic chiasm may be crushed by a pituitary tumor. Damage to the optic chiasm produces a unique form of visual field deficit, a bitemporal hemianopia . Recall that the fibers of the optic chiasm carry information about objects in the temporal hemifields of both eyes ."
"Consequently section of the optic chiasm produces a visual loss in only the temporal half of the visual field of each eye. When the patient views the world out of both eyes, the boundary of his binocular visual field is narrower than normal. Symptoms: A patient is brought to the emergency room complaining of a severe headache and nausea."
He is conscious and coherent when examined in the ER. Ophthalmoscope examination does not reveal abnormalities in either eye. Confrontation field testing indicates a visual loss in the right hemifield of both eyes.
"The patient is referred for neuroradiographic tests and perimetry testing. Perimetry Test Results: The results indicate a right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing . Side & Retinotopicity of damage: The visual loss  is not related to changes in the retina of either eye, involves field losses for both eyes, involves the right hemifields, is homonymous or congruent, spares the central visual field."
"You conclude that the visual field defect is related to damage that  is retrobulbar , is retrochiasmatic or postchiasmatic , involves the left calcarine cortex, may involve hemorrhage from a branch of the left posterior cerebral artery, spared the more caudal and lateral parts of the striate cortex, which receives collateral blood flow from branches of the middle cerebral artery. Neural imaging results indicate injury to the rostral half of the left calcarine cortex, which receives blood from the left posterior cerebral artery . Recall that the rostral calcarine cortex processes information from the visual field periphery, whereas the caudal and lateral striate cortex process information derived from the visual field center."
"Calcarine Cortex Damage. An infarct created by obstruction of, or a hemorrhage in, branches of the posterior cerebral artery may result in damage to the rostral calcarine cortex. Damage to the calcarine cortex on one side may produce a binocular, contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing ."
"A collateral blood supply from branches of the middle cerebral artery is believed to spare the cortical neurons in the caudal and lateral regions of the striate cortex, which receive information from the macular area. Symptoms: A patient, who is stabilized after suffering a stroke two months earlier, is referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist for evaluation. The patient does not appear to be blind but has problems with processing visual information."
"For example, the patient cannot describe the color of an object presented to him or recognize faces. He has normal spatial orientation and motion detection. The patient is referred for perimetry testing."
"Perimetry Test Results: The results indicate no consistent loss of vision. However, it is difficult to obtain consistent results because the patient tires easily and his attention appears to wander. Side & Retinotopicity of damage: The patient  is not blind in either eye, does not have deficits in detecting the location or movement of objects, does not exhibit the symptom of ""neglect"" , exhibits deficits in higher visual processing involving color and object recognition."
"You conclude that the neurological defect is  not related to damage in the visual pathway from the eye to the striate cortex, not related to damage in the middle or superior temporal gyrus, not related to damage in the parietal lobe, related to damage in the inferior temporal gyrus , involving branches of the posterior cerebral artery that supply the inferior temporal gyri. Neural imaging results indicate damage to the caudal portion of the inferior temporal lobe, which normally receives blood from branches of the posterior cerebral artery. Extrastriate or Association Cortex Damage: While destruction of the primary visual cortex produces blindness in the contralesional hemifield, damage to cortical areas surrounding the striate cortex does not Instead, they may produce profound deficits in the higher order-processing of visual information."
"For example, bilateral damage to a small area of the inferior temporal gyrus  produces a loss in the ability to recognize faces. Damage to more superior areas of the temporal lobe  produces an inability to recognize or comprehend written words and/or passages. Damage to areas in the parietal cortex may result in the inability to see motion ."
"The object does not appear to move; rather it appears to have jumped from one place to the next. Damage to large areas involving the posterior parietal cortex and superior temporal cortex may result in the symptom of ""neglect"", wherein objects in parts of the visual field are ignored or denied existence. In this chapter, you have learned how the visual system is organized in the brain."
"You have learned that stimulus features extracted by the retinal neurons  are kept segregated in separate “information channels” and processed in parallel by different cells at all levels of the visual system. Information coded and carried by one million retinal ganglion cells are distributed to hundreds of millions of cortical neurons in the occipital, parietal and temporal lobes. The perception of a coherent visual image is recomposed out of these fragments of information by the simultaneous activation of large areas of cortex."
"You have also learned how the spatial representation of the visual image is maintained by the retinotopic organization of the visual system and learned how this information is useful in determining the location and extent of damage to the visual system by examining the visual fields. Finally, you have learned that neuronal responses in visual cortex exhibit plasticity at different time scales, short term  and long term  – this plasticity allows visual cortex to construct an accurate picture of the world that can rapidly adapt to match the changes in the environment. Much of the brain and nervous system is devoted to the processing of sensory input, in order to construct detailed representations of the external environment."
"Through vision, audition, somatosensation, and the other senses, we perceive the world and our relationship to it. This elaborate processing would be of limited value, however, unless we had a way to act upon the environment that we are sensing, whether that action consist of running away from a predator; seeking shelter against the rain; searching for food when one is hungry; moving one’s lips and vocal cords in order to communicate with others; or performing the countless other varieties of actions that make up our daily lives. In some cases the relationship between the sensory input and the motor output are simple and direct; for example, touching a hot stove elicits an immediate withdrawal of the hand ."
"Usually, however, our conscious actions require not only sensory input but a host of other cognitive processes that allow us to choose the most appropriate motor output for the given circumstances. In each case, the final output is a set of commands to certain muscles in the body to exert force against some other object or forces . This entire process falls under the subject of motor control."
Volition. The motor system must generate movements that are adaptive and that accomplish the goals of the organism. These goals are evaluated and set by high-order areas of the brain.
The motor system must transform the goals into the appropriate activations of muscles to perform the desired movements. Coordination of signals to many muscle groups. Few movements are restricted to the activation of a single muscle.
"For example, the act of moving your hand from inside your pocket to a position in front of you requires the coordinated activity of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Making the same movement while removing a 2-lb weight from your pocket may result in the same trajectory of your hand, but will require different sets of forces on the muscles that make the movement. The task of the motor system is to determine the necessary forces and coordination at each joint in order to produce the final, smooth motion of the arm."
"Proprioception. In order to make a desired movement , it is essential for the motor system to know the starting position of the hand. Raising one’s hand from a resting position on a desk, compared to a resting position on top of the head, results in the same final position of the arm, but these two movements require different patterns of muscle activation."
"The motor system has a set of sensory inputs  that inform it of the length of muscles and the forces being applied to them; it uses this information to calculate joint position and other variables necessary to make the appropriate movement. Postural adjustments. The motor system must constantly produce postural adjustments in order to compensate for changes in the body’s center of mass as we move our limbs, head, and torso."
"Without these automatic adjustments, the simple act of reaching for a cup would cause us to fall, as the body’s center of mass shifts to a location in front of the body axis. Sensory feedback. In addition to the use of proprioception to sense the position of the body before a movement, the motor system must use other sensory information in order to perform the movement accurately."
"By comparing desired activity with actual activity, sensory feedback allows for corrections in movements as they take place, and it also allows modifications to motor programs so that future movements are performed more accurately. Compensation for the physical characteristics of the body and muscles. To exert a defined force on an object, it is not sufficient to know only the characteristics of the object ."
"The motor system must account for the physical characteristics of the body and muscles themselves. The bones and muscles have mass that must be considered when moving a joint, and the muscles themselves have a certain degree of resistance to movement. Unconscious processing."
"The motor system must perform many procedures in an automatic fashion, without the need for high-order control. Imagine if walking across the room required thinking about planting the foot at each step, paying attention to the movement of each muscle in the leg and making sure that the appropriate forces and contraction speeds are taking place. It would be hard to do anything else but that one task."
"Instead, many motor tasks are performed in an automatic fashion that does not require conscious processing. For example, many of the postural adjustments that the body makes during movement are performed without our awareness. These unconscious processes allow higher-order brain areas to concern themselves with broad desires and goals, rather than low-level implementations of movements."
"Adaptability. The motor system must adapt to changing circumstances. For example, as a child grows and its body changes, different constraints are placed on the motor system in terms of the size and mass of bones and muscles."
"The motor commands that work to raise the hand of an infant would fail completely to raise the hand of an adult. The system must adapt over time to change its output to accomplish the same goals. Furthermore, if the system were unable to adapt, we would never be able to acquire motor skills, such as playing a piano, hitting a baseball, or performing microsurgery."
"These are some of the many components of the motor system that allow us to perform complex movements in a seemingly effortless way. The brain has evolved exceedingly complex and sophisticated mechanisms to perform these tasks, and researchers have only scratched the surface in understanding the principles that underlie the brain’s control of movement.

"The brain has evolved exceedingly complex and sophisticated mechanisms to perform these tasks, and researchers have only scratched the surface in understanding the principles that underlie the brain’s control of movement. The ease with which we make most of our movements belies the enormous sophistication and complexity of the motor system. Engineers have spent decades trying to make machines perform simple tasks that we take for granted, yet the most advanced robotic systems do not come close to emulating the precision and smoothness of movement, under all types of conditions, that we achieve effortlessly and automatically."
"How does the brain do it? Although many of the details are not understood, two broad principles appear to be key concepts toward understanding motor control:  Functional Segregation. The motor system is divided into a number of different areas that control different aspects of movement ."
These areas are located throughout the nervous system. One of the key questions of research on motor control is to understand the functional roles played by each area. Hierarchical Organization.
"The different areas of the motor system are organized in a hierarchical fashion. The higher-order areas can concern themselves with more global tasks regarding action, such as deciding when to act, devising an appropriate sequence of actions, and coordinating the activity of many limbs. They do not have to program the exact force and velocity of individual muscles, or coordinate movements with changes in posture; these low-level tasks are performed by the lower levels of the hierarchy."
"The motor system hierarchy consists of 4 levels : the spinal cord, the brain stem, the motor cortex, and the association cortex. It also contains two side loops: the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, which interact with the hierarchy through connections with the thalamus. The spinal cord is the first level of the motor hierarchy."
It is the site where motor neurons are located. It is also the site of many interneurons and complex neural circuits that perform the “nuts and bolts” processing of motor control. These circuits execute the low-level commands that generate the proper forces on individual muscles and muscle groups to enable adaptive movements.
"The spinal cord also contains complex circuitry for such rhythmic behaviors as walking. Because this low level of the hierarchy takes care of these basic functions, higher levels  can process information related to the planning of movements, the construction of adaptive sequences of movements, and the coordination of whole-body movements, without having to encode the precise details of each muscle contraction. Alpha motor neurons  innervate skeletal muscle and cause the muscle contractions that generate movement."
"Motor neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synapse called the neuromuscular junction. When the acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors on the muscle fiber, an action potential is propagated along the muscle fiber in both directions . The action potential triggers the contraction of the muscle."
"If the ends of the muscle are fixed, keeping the muscle at the same length, then the contraction results on an increased force on the supports . If the muscle shortens against no resistance, the contraction results in constant force . The motor neurons that control limb and body movements are located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and the motor neurons that control head and facial movements are located in the motor nuclei of the brainstem."
"Even though the motor system is composed of many different types of neurons scattered throughout the CNS, the motor neuron is the only way in which the motor system can communicate with the muscles. Thus, all movements ultimately depend on the activity of lower motor neurons. The famous physiologist Sir Charles Sherrington referred to these motor neurons as the “final common pathway” in motor processing."
Motor neurons are not merely the conduits of motor commands generated from higher levels of the hierarchy. They are themselves components of complex circuits that perform sophisticated information processing. As shown in Figure 1.
"3, motor neurons have highly branched, elaborate dendritic trees, enabling them to integrate the inputs from large numbers of other neurons and to calculate proper outputs. Two terms are used to describe the anatomical relationship between motor neurons and muscles: the motor neuron pool and the motor unit. Motor neurons are clustered in columnar, spinal nuclei called motor neuron pools ."
"All of the motor neurons in a motor neuron pool innervate a single muscle , and all motor neurons that innervate a particular muscle are contained in the same motor neuron pool. Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between a muscle and a motor neuron pool. Each individual muscle fiber in a muscle is innervated by one, and only one, motor neuron ."
"A single motor neuron, however, can innervate many muscle fibers. The combination of an individual motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates is called a motor unit. The number of fibers innervated by a motor unit is called its innervation ratio."
"If a muscle is required for fine control or for delicate movements , its motor units will tend to have small innervation ratios. That is, each motor neuron will innervate a small number of muscle fibers , enabling many nuances of movement of the entire muscle. If a muscle is required only for coarse movements , its motor units will tend to have a high innervation ratio , as there is no necessity for individual muscle fibers to undergo highly coordinated, differential contractions to produce a fine movement."
A motor neuron controls the amount of force that is exerted by muscle fibers. There are two principles that govern the relationship between motor neuron activity and muscle force: the rate code and the size principle. Rate Code.
Motor neurons use a rate code to signal the amount of force to be exerted by a muscle. An increase in the rate of action potentials fired by the motor neuron causes an increase in the amount of force that the motor unit generates. This code is illustrated in Figure 1.
"5. When the motor neuron fires a single action potential , the muscle twitches slightly, and then relaxes back to its resting state. If the motor neuron fires after the muscle has returned to baseline, then the magnitude of the next muscle twitch will be the same as the first twitch."
"However, if the rate of firing of the motor neuron increases, such that a second action potential occurs before the muscle has relaxed back to baseline, then the second action potential produces a greater amount of force than the first  . With increasing firing rates, the summation grows stronger, up to a limit. When the successive action potentials no longer produce a summation of muscle contraction , the muscle is in a state called tetanus ."
"Size Principle. When a signal is sent to the motor neurons to execute a movement, motor neurons are not all recruited at the same time or at random. The motor neuron size principle states that, with increasing strength of input onto motor neurons, smaller motor neurons are recruited and fire action potentials before larger motor neurons are recruited."
"Why does this orderly recruitment occur? Recall the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance : V = IR. Because smaller motor neurons have a smaller membrane surface area, they have fewer ion channels, and therefore a larger input resistance."
"Larger motor neurons have more membrane surface and correspondingly more ion channels; therefore, they have a smaller input resistance. Because of Ohm’s Law, a small amount of synaptic current will be sufficient to cause the membrane potential of a small motor neuron to reach firing threshold, while the large motor neuron stays below threshold. As the amount of current increases, the membrane potential of the larger motor neuron also increases, until it also reaches firing threshold."
"Figure 1，6 demonstrates how the size principle governs the amount of force generated by a muscle. Because motor units are recruited in an orderly fashion, weak inputs onto motor neurons will cause only a few motor units to be active, resulting in a small force exerted by the muscle . With stronger inputs, more motor neurons will be recruited, resulting in more force applied to the muscle ."
"Moreover, different types of muscle fibers are innervated by small and larger motor neurons. Small motor neurons innervate slow-twitch fibers; intermediate-sized motor neurons innervate fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant fibers; and large motor neurons innervate fast-twitch, fatigable muscle fibers. The slow-twitch fibers generate less force than the fast-twitch fibers, but they are able to maintain these levels of force for long periods."
"These fibers are used for maintaining posture and making other low-force movements. Fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant fibers are recruited when the input onto motor neurons is large enough to recruit intermediate-sized motor neurons. These fibers generate more force than slow-twitch fibers, but they are not able to maintain the force as long as the slow-twitch fibers."
"Finally, fast-twitch, fatigable fibers are recruited when the largest motor neurons are activated. These fibers produce large amounts of force, but they fatigue very quickly. They are used when the organism must generate a burst of large amounts of force, such as in an escape mechanism."
"Most muscles contain both fast- and slow-twitch fibers, but in different proportions. Thus, the white meat of a chicken, used to control the wings, is composed primarily of fast-twitch fibers, whereas the dark meat, used to maintain balance and posture, is composed primarily of slow-twitch fibers. The motor system requires sensory input in order to function properly."
"In addition to sensory information about the external environment, the motor system also requires sensory information about the current state of the muscles and limbs themselves. Proprioception is the sense of the body’s position in space based on specialized receptors that reside in the muscles and tendons. The muscle spindle signals the length of a muscle and changes in the length of a muscle."
The Golgi tendon organ signals the amount of force being applied to a muscle. Muscle spindles are collections of 6-8 specialized muscle fibers that are located within the muscle mass itself . These fibers do not contribute significantly to the force generated by the muscle.
"Rather, they are specialized receptors that signal  the length and  the rate of change of length  of the muscle. Because of the fusiform shape of the muscle spindle, these fibers are referred to as intrafusal fibers. The large majority of muscle fibers that allow the muscle to do work are termed extrafusal fibers."
"Each muscle contains many muscle spindles; muscles that are necessary for fine movements contain more spindles than muscles that are used for posture or coarse movements. There are 3 types of muscle spindle fibers, characterized by their shape and the type of information they convey . Nuclear Chain fibers."
These fibers are so-named because their nuclei are aligned in a single row  in the center of the fiber. They signal information about the static length of the muscle. Static Nuclear Bag fibers.
"These fibers are so-named because their nuclei are collected in a bundle in the middle of the fiber. Like the nuclear chain fiber, these fibers signal information about the static length of a muscle. Dynamic Nuclear Bag fibers."
"These fibers are anatomically similar to the static nuclear bag fibers, but they signal primarily information about the rate of change  of muscle length. A typical muscle spindle is composed of 1 dynamic nuclear bag fiber, 1 static nuclear bag fiber, and ~5 nuclear chain fibers. Because the muscle spindle is located in parallel with the extrafusal fibers, it will stretch along with the muscle."
The muscle spindle signals muscle length and velocity to the CNS through two types of specialized sensory fibers that innervate the intrafusal fibers. These sensory fibers have stretch receptors that open and close as a function of the length of the intrafusal fiber. Group Ia afferents  wrap around the central portion of all 3 types of intrafusal fibers; these specialized endings are called annulospiral endings.
"Because they innervate all 3 types of intrafusal fibers, Group Ia afferents provide information about both length and velocity. Group II afferents  innervate the ends of the nuclear chain fibers and the static nuclear bag fibers at specialized junctions termed flower spray endings. Because they do not innervate the dynamic nuclear bag fibers, Group II afferents signal information about muscle length only."
"Because of their patterns of innervation onto the three types of intrafusal fibers, Group Ia and Group II afferents respond differently to different types of muscle movements. Figure 1. 9 shows the responses of each type of afferent to a linear stretch of the muscle."
"Initially, both Group Ia and Group II fibers fire at a certain rate, encoding the current length of the muscle. During the stretch, the two types differ in their responses. The Group Ia afferent fires at a very high rate during the stretch, encoding the velocity of the muscle length; at the end of the stretch, its firing decreases, as the muscle is no longer changing length."
"Note, however, that its firing rate is still higher than it was before the stretch, as it is now encoding the new length of the muscle. Compare the response of the Group Ia afferent to the Group II afferent. The Group II afferent increases its firing rate steadily as the muscle is stretched."
"Its firing rate does not depend on the rate of change of the muscle; rather, its firing rate depends only on the immediate length of the muscle. Although intrafusal fibers do not contribute significantly to muscle contraction, they do have contractile elements at their ends that are innervated by motor neurons. Motor neurons are divided into two groups."
"Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal fibers, the highly contracting fibers that supply the muscle with its power. Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers, which contract only slightly. The function of intrafusal fiber contraction is not to provide force to the muscle; rather, gamma activation of the intrafusal fiber is necessary to keep the muscle spindle taut, and therefore sensitive to stretch, over a wide range of muscle lengths."
"This concept is illustrated in Figure 1. 10. If a resting muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle becomes stretched in parallel, sending signals through the primary and secondary afferents."
"A subsequent contraction of the muscle, however, removes the pull on the spindle, and it becomes slack, causing the spindle afferents to cease firing. If the muscle were to be stretched again, the muscle spindle would not be able to signal this stretch. Thus, the spindle is rendered temporarily insensitive to stretch after the muscle has contracted."
"Activation of gamma motor neurons prevents this temporary insensitivity by causing a weak contraction of the intrafusal fibers, in parallel with the contraction of the muscle. This contraction keeps the spindle taut at all times and maintains its sensitivity to changes in the length of the muscle. Thus, when the CNS instructs a muscle to contract, it not only sends the appropriate signals to the alpha motor neurons, it also instructs gamma motor neurons to contract the intrafusal fibers appropriately; this coordinated process is referred to as alpha-gamma coactivation."
"The Golgi tendon organ is a specialized receptor that is located between the muscle and the tendon . Unlike the muscle spindle, which is located in parallel with extrafusal fibers, the Golgi tendon organ is located in series with the muscle and signals information about the load or force being applied to the muscle. A Golgi tendon organ is made up of a capsule containing numerous collagen fibers ."
"The organ is innervated by primary afferents called Group Ib fibers, which have specialized endings that weave in between the collagen fibers. When force is applied to a muscle, the Golgi tendon organ is stretched, causing the collagen fibers to squeeze and distort the membranes of the primary afferent sensory endings. As a result, the afferent is depolarized, and it fires action potentials to signal the amount of force."
"Figure 1,2 illustrates the difference in information conveyed by muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. At the resting position, the Ia afferents of spindles in the triceps muscle fire at a steady rate to encode the present length of the muscle, and the Ib afferents of the Golgi tendon organs of the biceps muscle fire at a low rate. When a light object  is placed in the hand, there is little change in the firing rate of either afferent."
"When the hand starts to rise, however, the triceps muscle is stretched, and the Ia afferent fibers increase their firing rate as a function of muscle length. The Ib fibers do not change appreciably, because the balloon does not add much load to the muscle. What if a heavy object  were placed in the hand instead?"
"Because a heavy load is now placed on the biceps, the Ib afferents fire vigorously. Note that the Ia afferent is not affected, as the muscle length has not changed. When the arm begins to rise, however, the Ia afferents fire, just as with the balloon."
"As noted in the previous chapter, a sense of body position is necessary for adaptive motor control. In order to move a limb toward a particular location, it is imperative to know the initial starting position of the limb, as well as any force applied to the limb. Muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs provide this type of information."
"In addition, these receptors are components of certain spinal reflexes that are important for both clinical diagnosis as well as for a basic understanding of the principles of motor control. The myotatic reflex is illustrated in Figure 2. 1."
"A waiter is holding an empty tray, when unexpectedly a pitcher of water is placed on the tray. Because the waiter’s muscles were not prepared to support the increased weight, the tray should fall. However, a spinal reflex is automatically initiated to keep the tray relatively stable."
"When the heavy pitcher is placed on the tray, the increased weight stretches the biceps muscle, which results in the activation of the muscle spindle’s Ia afferents. The Ia afferents have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, send projections into the spinal cord, and make synapses directly on alpha motor neurons that innervate the same  muscle. Thus, activation of the Ia afferent causes a monosynaptic activation of the alpha motor neuron that causes the muscle to contract."
"As a result, the stretch of the muscle is quickly counteracted, and the waiter is able to maintain the tray at the same position. A major role of the myotatic reflex is the maintenance of posture. If one is standing upright and starts to sway to the left, muscles in the legs and torso are stretched, activating the myotatic reflex to counteract the sway."
"In this way, the higher levels of the motor system are able to send a simple command  and then be uninvolved in its implementation. The lower levels of the hierarchy implement the command with such mechanisms as the myotatic reflex, freeing the higher levels to perform other tasks such as planning the next sequence of movements. The myotatic reflex is an important clinical reflex."
"It is the same circuit that produces the knee-jerk, or stretch, reflex. When the physician taps the patellar tendon with a hammer, this action causes the knee extensor muscle to stretch abruptly. This stretch activates the myotatic reflex, causing an extension of the lower leg."
"As discussed below, spinal reflexes can be modulated by higher levels of the hierarchy, and thus a hyperactive or hypoactive stretch reflex is an important clinical sign to localize neurological damage. Joints are controlled by two opposing sets of muscles, extensors and flexors, which must work in synchrony. Thus, when a muscle spindle is stretched and the stretch reflex is activated, the opposing muscle group must be inhibited to prevent it from working against the resulting contraction of the homonymous muscle ."
"This inhibition is accomplished by an inhibitory interneuron in the spinal cord. The Ia afferent of the muscle spindle bifurcates in the spinal cord . One branch innervates the alpha motor neuron that causes the homonymous muscle to contract, producing the behavioral reflex."
"The other branch innervates the Ia inhibitory interneuron, which in turn innervates the alpha motor neuron that synapses onto the opposing muscle. Because the interneuron is inhibitory, it prevents the opposing alpha motor neuron from firing, thereby reducing the contraction of the opposing muscle. Without this reciprocal inhibition, both groups of muscles might contract simultaneously and work against each other."
"The Golgi tendon organ is involved in a spinal reflex known as the autogenic inhibition reflex . When tension is applied to a muscle, the Group Ib fibers that innervate the Golgi tendon organ are activated. These afferents have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, and they project into the spinal cord and synapse onto an interneuron called the Ib inhibitory interneuron."
"This interneuron makes an inhibitory synapse onto the alpha motor neuron that innervates the same muscle that caused the Ib afferent to fire. As a result of this reflex, activation of the Ib afferent causes the muscle to cease contraction, as the alpha motor neuron becomes inhibited. Because this reflex contains an interneuron between the sensory afferent and the motor neuron, it is an example of a disynaptic reflex."
"For many years, it was thought that the function of the autogenic inhibition circuit was to protect the muscle from excessive amounts of force that might damage it. A classic example is that of the weightlifter straining to raise a heavy load, when suddenly the autogenic inhibition reflex is activated and the muscle loses power, causing the weight to fall to the ground. This function was ascribed to the reflex because early work suggested that the Golgi tendon organ was only activated when large amounts of force were applied to it."
"More recent evidence indicates, however, that the Golgi tendon organ is sensitive to much lower levels of force than previously believed. Thus, the autogenic inhibition reflex may be more extensively involved in motor control under normal conditions. One possibility is that this reflex helps to spread the amount of work evenly across the entire muscle, so that all motor units are working efficiently."
"That is, if some muscle fibers are bearing more of the load than others, their Golgi tendon organs will be more active, which will tend to inhibit the contraction of those fibers. As a result, other muscle fibers that are less active will have to contract more to pick up the slack, thereby sharing the work load more efficiently. Just as in the stretch reflex, the autogenic inhibition reflex must coordinate the activity of the extensor and flexor muscle groups ."
"The Ib afferent fiber bifurcates in the spinal cord. One branch innervates the Ib inhibitory interneuron. The other branch innervates an excitatory interneuron that, in turn, innervates the alpha motor neuron that controls the antagonist muscle."
"Thus, when the homonymous muscle is inhibited from contracting, the antagonist muscle is caused to contract, allowing the opposing muscle groups to work in synchrony. Spinal reflexes can be initiated by nonproprioceptive receptors as well as by proprioceptors. An important reflex initiated by cutaneous receptors and pain receptors is the flexor reflex."
"We have all experienced this reflex after accidentally touching a hot stove or a sharp object, as we withdraw our hand even before we consciously experience the sensation of pain. This quick reflex removes the limb from the damaging stimulus more quickly than if the pain signal had to travel up to the brain, be brought to conscious awareness, and then trigger a decision to withdraw the limb. The reflex circuit is illustrated in Figure 2."
5. A sharp object touching the foot causes the activation of Group III afferents of pain receptors. These afferents enter the spinal cord and then travel up the cord.
"A branch of the afferent innervates an excitatory interneuron in the lumbar region of the spinal cord, which then excites an alpha motor neuron that causes contraction of the thigh flexor muscle. The Group III afferent also continues upward to the L2 vertebra, where another branch innervates an excitatory interneuron at this level. This interneuron excites the alpha motor neurons that excite the hip flexor muscle, allowing the coordinated activity of two muscle groups to withdraw the whole leg away from the painful stimulus."
"Thus, spinal reflexes work not only at a single joint; they can also coordinate the activity of multiple joints simultaneously. When the knee joints and the hip joints are flexed, the antagonist extensor muscles must be inhibited . Thus, the Group III afferents innervate inhibitory interneurons that in turn innervate the alpha motor neurons controlling the antagonist muscle."
"Further circuitry is needed to make the flexor reflex adaptive. Because the weight of the body is supported by both legs, the flexor reflex must coordinate the activity not only of the leg being withdrawn but also of the opposite leg . Imagine stepping on a tack, and having the flexor reflex withdraw your right leg immediately."
"The left leg must simultaneously extend in order to support the body weight that would have been supported by the right leg. Without this coordination of the two legs, the shift in body mass would cause a loss of balance. Thus, the flexor reflex incorporates a crossed extension reflex."
"A branch of the Group III afferent innervates an excitatory interneuron that sends its axon across the midline into the contralateral spinal cord. There it excites the alpha motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles of the opposite leg, allowing balance and body posture to be maintained. Axons of alpha motor neurons bifurcate in the spinal cord and innervate a special inhibitory interneuron called the Renshaw cell ."
"This interneuron innervates and inhibits the very same motor neuron that caused it to fire. Thus, a motor neuron regulates its own activity by inhibiting itself when it fires. This negative feedback loop is thought to stabilize the firing rate of motor neurons."
"The reflex circuits demonstrate that sophisticated neural processing occurs at the lowest level of the motor hierarchy. These automatic reflexes can be modulated, however, by higher levels of the hierarchy. For example, when touching an iron to see if it is hot, your flexor reflex may be hypersensitive."
"As a result, you pull your hand away repeatedly before even touching the iron, anticipating that it may be hot. Conversely, if you remove a hot dish from the oven and the heat starts to go through the oven mitt, you will suppress the flexor response so that you do not drop your dinner as you rush to put it down on a table. These modulations  of the spinal reflexes arise from the descending pathways from the brainstem and cortex."
Voluntary movement and some sensory-driven reflex actions are also controlled by the descending pathways. The corticospinal system controls motor neurons and interneurons in the spinal cord. The corticobulbar system controls brainstem nuclei that innervate cranial muscles.
"Although the motor system is organized hierarchically, the hierarchy is not a simple chain of processing from higher to lower areas. Many pathways enable the different levels of the hierarchy to influence each other. Thus, the flow of information through the motor system has both a serial organization  and a parallel organization ."
"This parallel organization is critically important in understanding the various dysfunctions that can result from damage to the motor system. If the motor hierarchy had a strictly serial organization, like a series of links on a chain, then damage to any part of the system would produce severe deficits or paralysis in almost all types of movements. However, because of the parallel nature of processing, paralysis is actually a relatively rare outcome, produced by damage to the lowest level of the hierarchy."
"Damage to higher levels results in deficits in motor planning, initiation, coordination, and so forth, but movement is still possible. The parallel nature of organization is also important for the ability of undamaged parts of the motor system to compensate  for injuries to other parts of the system. Descending motor pathways arise from multiple regions of the brain and send axons down the spinal cord that innervate alpha motor neurons, gamma motor neurons, and interneurons."
The motor neurons are topographically organized in the anterior horn of the spinal cord according to two rules: the flexor-extensor rule and the proximal-distal rule . Corticospinal tracts. The corticospinal tract originates in the motor cortex .
"The axons of motor projection neurons collect in the internal capsule, and then course through the crus cerebri  in the midbrain. At the level of the medulla, these axons form the medullary pyramids on the ventral surface of the brainstem . At the level of the caudal medulla, the corticospinal tract splits into two tracts."
"Approximately 90% of the axons cross over to the contralateral side at the pyramidal decussation, forming the lateral corticospinal tract. These axons continue to course through the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord, before synapsing either directly onto alpha motor neurons or onto interneurons in the ventral horn. The remaining 10% of the axons that do not cross at the caudal medulla constitute the anterior corticospinal tract, as they continue down the spinal cord in the anterior funiculus."
"When they reach the spinal segment at which they terminate, they cross over to the contralateral side through the anterior white commissure and innervate alpha motor neurons or interneurons in the anterior horn. Thus, both the lateral and anterior corticospinal tracts are crossed pathways; they cross the midline at different locations, however. Function."
The corticospinal tract  is the primary pathway that carries the motor commands that underlie voluntary movement. The lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for the control of the distal musculature and the anterior corticospinal tract is responsible for the control of the proximal musculature. A particularly important function of the lateral corticospinal tract is the fine control of the digits of the hand.
"The corticospinal tract is the only descending pathway in which some axons make synaptic contacts directly onto alpha motor neurons. This direct cortical innervation presumably is necessary to allow the powerful processing networks of the cortex to control the activity of the spinal circuits that direct the exquisite movements of the fingers and hands. The percentage of axons in the corticospinal tract that innervate alpha motor neurons directly is greater in humans and nonhuman primates than in other mammals, presumably reflecting the increased manual dexterity of primates."
"Damage to the corticospinal tract results in a permanent loss of the fine control of the extremities. Although parallel descending pathways can often recover the function of more coarse movements, these pathways are not capable of generating fine, skilled movements. In addition to the fine control of distal muscles, the corticospinal tract also plays a role in the voluntary control of axial muscles."
"Rubrospinal tract. The rubrospinal tract originates in the red nucleus of the midbrain . The axons immediately cross to the contralateral side of the brain, and they course through the brainstem and the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord."
The axons innervate spinal neurons at all levels of the spinal cord. Function. The rubrospinal tract is an alternative by which voluntary motor commands can be sent to the spinal cord.
"Although it is a major pathway in many animals, it is relatively minor in humans. Activation of this tract causes excitation of flexor muscles and inhibition of extensor muscles. The rubrospinal tract is thought to play a role in movement velocity, as rubrospinal lesions cause a temporary slowness in movement."
"In addition, because the red nucleus receives most of its input from the cerebellum, the rubrospinal tract probably plays a role in transmitting learned motor commands from the cerebellum to the musculature. The red nucleus also receives some input from the motor cortex, and it is therefore probably an important pathway for the recovery of some voluntary motor function after damage to the corticospinal tract. Vestibulospinal tracts."
"The two vestibulospinal tracts originate in 2 of the 4 vestibular nuclei . The lateral vestibulospinal tract originates in the lateral vestibular nucleus. It courses through the brainstem and through the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord on the ipsilateral side, before exiting ipsilaterally at all levels of the spinal cord."
"The medial vestibulospinal tract originates in the medial vestibular nucleus, splits immediately and courses bilaterally through the brainstem via the medial longitudinal fasciculus  and through the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord, before exiting at or above the T6 vertebra. Function. The vestibulospinal tracts mediate postural adjustments and head movements."
"They also help the body to maintain balance. Small movements of the body are detected by the vestibular sensory neurons, and motor commands to counteract these movements are sent through the vestibulospinal tracts to appropriate muscle groups throughout the body. The lateral vestibulospinal tract excites antigravity muscles in order to exert control over postural changes necessary to compensate for tilts and movements of the body."
The medial vestibulospinal tract innervates neck muscles in order to stabilize head position as one moves around the world. It is also important for the coordination of head and eye movements. Reticulospinal tracts.
"The two reticulospinal tracts originate in the brainstem reticular formation, a large, diffusely organized collection of neurons in the pons and medulla . The pontine reticulospinal tract originates in the pontine reticular formation, courses ipsilaterally through the medial longitudinal fasciculus and through the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord, and exits ipsilaterally at all spinal levels. The medullary reticulospinal tract originates in the medullary reticular formation, courses mainly ipsilaterally  through the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord, and exits at all spinal levels."
"Function. The reticulospinal tracts are a major alternative to the corticospinal tract, by which cortical neurons can control motor function by their inputs onto reticular neurons. These tracts regulate the sensitivity of flexor responses to ensure that only noxious stimuli elicit the responses."
"Damage to the reticulospinal tract can thus cause harmless stimuli, such as gentle touches, to elicit a flexor reflex. The reticular formation also contains circuitry for many complex actions, such as orienting, stretching, and maintaining a complex posture. Commands that initiate locomotor circuits in the spinal cord are also thought to be transmitted through the medullary reticulospinal tract."
"Thus, the reticulospinal tracts are involved in many aspects of motor control, including the integration of sensory input to guide motor output. Tectospinal tract. The tectospinal tract  originates in the deep layers of the superior colliculus and crosses the midline immediately."
"It then courses through the pons and medulla, just anterior to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. It courses through the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord, where the majority of the fibers terminate in the upper cervical levels. Function."
"Little is known about the function of the tectospinal tract, but because of the nature of the visual response properties of neurons in the superior colliculus , it is presumably involved in the reflexive turning of the head to orient to visual stimuli. Voluntary movement. The most distinctive function of the descending motor pathways is the control of voluntary movement."
"These movements are initiated in the cerebral cortex, and the motor commands are transmitted to the musculature through a variety of descending pathways, including the corticospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and reticulospinal tracts. How voluntary movements are initiated and coordinated by the motor cortex is the subject of the next chapter. Reflex modulation."
Another critical function of the descending motor pathways is to modulate the reflex circuits in the spinal cord. The adaptiveness of spinal reflexes can change depending on the behavioral context; sometimes the gain  or even the sign  of a reflex must be changed in order to make the resulting movement adaptive. The descending pathways are responsible for controlling these variables.
"For example, consider the flexor reflex under two conditions. Imagine a situation in which you want to pick up a dish from the stove top, but you are uncertain whether it is hot or cold. You may attempt to lightly touch the surface, and this will often lower the threshold of the flexor reflex, making you more likely to pull your hand away even if the dish is not particularly hot."
"Descending pathways have lowered the threshold for producing the reflex in this case, making it easier for a weaker nociceptive input to trigger the reflex; these pathways can also change the gain of the reflex, making the withdrawal response greater than usual. Imagine now picking up the dish in order to move it to the table. As you hold the dish, more of its heat begins to transfer to your hand, and it starts to get quite hot."
"Rather than dropping the dish and spilling your dinner all over the floor, you rush to the table to put it down, before withdrawing your hand and wishing you had used an oven mitt. In this case, the descending pathways inhibited the flexor response. Gamma bias."
"Recall from the previous chapter that there are two types of spinal motor neurons. Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which provide the force for a muscle contraction. Gamma motor neurons innervate the ends of intrafusal fibers and help to maintain the tautness of muscle spindles, such that they are sensitive to changes of muscle length over a wide range."
"In order to work adaptively, the activity of alpha and gamma motor neurons must be coordinated. Thus, whenever motor commands are sent by descending pathways to alpha motor neurons, the appropriate compensating commands are sent to gamma motor neurons. This coordination of alpha-gamma motor commands is called alpha-gamma coactivation, and the adjustment of spindle sensitivity by gamma activation is called gamma bias."
"Consider the following two examples:  When a command is given to a muscle to contract, the muscle spindles become slack, thereby making them insensitive to further changes in muscle length. To compensate for this, the gamma motor neurons that innervate these intrafusal muscle fibers are activated in concert with the alpha motor neurons, allowing the intrafusal fibers to contract with the muscle. This preserves the sensitivity of the muscle to unexpected stretches of the muscle ."
"When a muscle contracts, the antagonist muscle is stretched during the movement. An obvious problem arises when one considers the stretch reflex of the antagonist muscle. If contraction of a muscle causes the activation of the stretch reflex of the antagonist muscle, the antagonist muscle will contract to resist the movement of the limb."
"How is it possible to ever flex a joint when the stretch reflex of the extensor muscle causes it to extend the joint instead? Alpha-gamma coactivation solves this problem by relaxing the contraction of the intrafusal fibers of the antagonist muscle, allowing the muscle to be stretched without triggering the stretch reflex during a voluntary movement. The previous chapters discussed the lower levels of the motor hierarchy , which are involved in the low-level, “nuts and bolts” processing that controls the activity of individual muscles."
"Individual alpha motor neurons control the force exerted by a particular muscle, and spinal circuits can control sophisticated and complex behaviors such as walking and reflex actions. The types of movements controlled by these circuits are not initiated consciously, however. Voluntary movements require the participation of the third and fourth levels of the hierarchy: the motor cortex and the association cortex."
"These areas of the cerebral cortex plan voluntary actions, coordinate sequences of movements, make decisions about proper behavioral strategies and choices, evaluate the appropriateness of a particular action given the current behavioral or environmental context, and relay commands to the appropriate sets of lower motor neurons to execute the desired actions. The motor cortex comprises three different areas of the frontal lobe, immediately anterior to the central sulcus. These areas are the primary motor cortex , the premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor area ."
"Electrical stimulation of these areas elicits movements of particular body parts. The primary motor cortex, or M1, is located on the precentral gyrus and on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface of the brain. Of the three motor cortex areas, stimulation of the primary motor cortex requires the least amount of electrical current to elicit a movement."
"Low levels of brief stimulation typically elicit simple movements of individual body parts. Stimulation of premotor cortex or the supplementary motor area requires higher levels of current to elicit movements, and often results in more complex movements than stimulation of primary motor cortex. Stimulation for longer time periods  in monkeys results in the movement of a particular body part to a stereotyped posture or position, regardless of the initial starting point of the body part ."
"Thus, the premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas appear to be higher level areas that encode complex patterns of motor output and that select appropriate motor plans to achieve desired end results. Like the somatosensory cortex of the postcentral gyrus, the primary motor cortex is somatotopically organized . Stimulation of the anterior paracentral lobule elicits movements of the contralateral leg."
"As the stimulating electrode is moved across the precentral gyrus from dorsomedial to ventrolateral, movements are elicited progressively from the torso, arm, hand, and face . The representations of body parts that perform precise, delicate movements, such as the hands and face, are disproportionately large compared to the representations of body parts that perform only coarse, unrefined movements, such as the trunk or legs. The premotor cortex and supplementary motor area also contain somatotopic maps."
"One might predict that the motor cortex “homunculus” arises because neurons that control individual muscles are clustered together in the cortex. That is, all of the neurons that control the biceps muscle may be located together, and all of the neurons that control the triceps may be clustered nearby, and the neurons that control the soleus muscle may be clustered in a region further removed. Electrophysiological recordings have shown that this is not the case, however."
"Movements of individual muscles are correlated with activity from widespread parts of the primary motor cortex. Similarly, stimulation of small regions of primary motor cortex elicits movements that require the activity of numerous muscles. Thus, the primary motor cortex homunculus does not represent the activity of individual muscles."
"Rather, it apparently represents the movements of individual body parts, which often require the coordinated activity of large groups of muscles throughout the body. The cortex can also influence the processing of the side loops of the motor hierarchy. The corticostriate tract innervates the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal ganglia."
"The corticopontine tract and cortico-olivary tract innervate important inputs to the cerebellum. Finally, cortical areas can influence other cortical areas, directly via corticocortical pathways and indirectly via the corticothalamic pathways . Most of these pathways are bi-directional."
"Thus, motor cortex receives input from other cortical areas, directly and indirectly through the thalamus, and it receives input from the cerebellum and basal ganglia, always through the thalamus. Like all parts of the neocortex, the primary motor cortex is made of six layers . Unlike primary sensory areas, primary motor cortex is agranular cortex; that is, it does not have a cell-packed granular layer ."
"Instead, the most distinctive layer of primary motor cortex is its descending output layer , which contains the giant Betz cells. These pyramidal cells and other projection neurons of the primary motor cortex make up ~30% of the fibers in the corticospinal tract. The rest of the fibers come from the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area , the somatosensory cortex , and the posterior parietal cortex ."
"As discussed above, the primary motor cortex does not generally control individual muscles directly, but rather appears to control individual movements or sequences of movements that require the activity of multiple muscle groups. Alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, in turn, encode the force of contraction of groups of muscle fibers using the rate code and the size principle. Thus, in accordance with the concept of hierarchical organization of the motor system, the information represented by motor cortex is a higher level of abstraction than the information represented by spinal motor neurons."
"What is encoded by the neurons in primary motor cortex? Clues have come from recording the activity of these neurons as experimental animals perform different motor tasks. In general, primary motor cortex encodes the parameters that define individual movements or simple movement sequences."
"Primary motor cortex neurons fire 5-100 msec before the onset of a movement. Thus, rather than firing as the result of muscle activity, these neurons are involved in relaying motor commands to the alpha motor neurons that eventually cause the appropriate muscles to contract. Primary motor cortex encodes the force of a movement."
The amount of force required to raise the arm from one location to another is much greater if one is holding a bowling ball than if one is holding a balloon. Many neurons in primary motor cortex encode the amount of force that is necessary to make such a movement . Note the distinction between movement force and muscle force.
"Whereas a minority of primary motor cortex neurons encodes individual muscle force, a larger number encodes the amount of force necessary for a particular movement, regardless of which individual muscles are used. Alpha motor neurons, in turn, translate the commands of the motor cortex neurons and control the amount of force generated by individual muscles to accomplish that movement, under the principles of the rate code and the size principle. Primary motor cortex encodes the direction of movement."
"Many neurons in the primary motor cortex are selective for a particular direction of movement. For example, one cell may fire strongly when the hand is moved to the left, whereas it will be inhibited when the hand is moved to the right . Primary motor cortex encodes the extent of movement."
"The firing of some neurons is correlated with the distance of a movement. A monkey was trained to move its arm to different target locations that varied in direction and distance from the center. The firing of many neurons was correlated with the direction of movement , whereas the firing of other neurons was correlated with the distance of the movement."
"Interestingly, some neurons were correlated with the interaction of a particular distance and direction; that is, they were correlated with a particular target position. Primary motor cortex neurons encode the speed of movement. Almost all targeted movements follow a typical bell-shaped curve of velocity as a function of distance ."
"For example, when the hand moves an object such as a coffee cup from one location to another , the hand accelerates during the first half of the movement, reaches a peak velocity approximately halfway to the target, and then decelerates until it reaches the target. The firing rate of some primary motor cortex neurons in monkeys correlates with this bell-shaped speed profile, demonstrating that information about movement speed is contained in the spike trains of these neurons. The premotor cortex sends axons to the primary motor cortex as well as to the spinal cord directly."
"It performs more complex, task-related processing than primary motor cortex. Stimulation of premotor areas in the monkey at a high level of current produces more complex postures than stimulation of the primary motor cortex. The premotor cortex appears to be involved in the selection of appropriate motor plans for voluntary movements, whereas the primary motor cortex is involved in the execution of these voluntary movements."
"Premotor cortex neurons signal the preparation for movement. Monkeys were trained to make a particular movement in response to a visual signal, with a variable delay between the onset of the signal and the onset of the movement . Recordings from premotor cortex have shown that many neurons fire selectively in the delay interval, for many seconds before the onset of the movement."
"A particular neuron will fire when the monkey is preparing to make a movement to the left, for example, but will be silent when the monkey is preparing to make a movement to the right. Thus, the firing of this type of neuron does not cause the movement itself, but appears to be involved in preparing the monkey to make the correct movement when the “Go” signal is given. This type of neuron is called a motor-set neuron, as it fires when the monkey is preparing, or getting set, to make a movement."
"Premotor cortex neurons signal various sensory aspects associated with particular motor acts. Some premotor neurons fire when the animal is performing a particular action, such as breaking a peanut . Interestingly, the same neuron fires selectively when the animal sees another monkey or person breaking the peanut."
"It also fires selectively to the sound of a peanut shell being broke, even without any visual or motor activity. These neurons are called “mirror” neurons, because they respond not only to a particular action of the monkey but also to the sight  of another individual performing the same action. Premotor cortex is sensitive to the behavioral context of a particular movement."
"The premotor cortex of human subjects was imaged with functional MRI as they observed video of a hand grasping a cup . In one condition, the cup was full and surrounded by full plates of food; the implication was that the person was grasping the cup to take a drink. In the other condition, the cup was empty and surrounded by dirty dishes; the implication was that the person was grasping the cup to clear the table."
"In this experiment, the premotor cortex was more active when subjects viewed the former video than the latter, even though the movements were the same. Thus, premotor cortex neurons are sensitive to the inferred intentions of a movement, not just the movement itself, as deduce from the behavioral context in which the movement occurred. Premotor cortex signals correct and incorrect actions."
"Human subjects were studied in an fMRI experiment as they observed video clips of various correct and incorrect motor acts. A correct action was one in which the movement and the associated object was performed correctly, such as setting the time on a clock. An object error was one in which the action was correct, but the object was incorrect, such as polishing a brown shoe with black shoe polish."
"A movement error was one in which the object was correct, but the movement was incorrect, such as attempting to put a coin into a piggy bank when the coin was oriented perpendicular to the coin slot. In this experiment, the premotor cortex was activated bilaterally during the correct actions trials and the movement error trials; for the object error trials, only the premotor cortex of the left hemisphere was activated preferentially. The supplementary motor area  is involved in programming complex sequences of movements and coordinating bilateral movements."
"Whereas the premotor cortex appears to be involved in selecting motor programs based on visual stimuli or on abstract associations, the supplementary motor area appears to be involved in selecting movements based on remembered sequences of movements. SMA responds to sequences of movements and to mental rehearsal of sequences of movements . Brain activity was measured in a PET scanner while subjects made simple and complex sequences of movement."
"When the movements were simple, such as a repetitive movement of a single digit, the primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex were activated on the contralateral hemisphere. When the subject was asked to perform a complex sequence of finger movements, the SMA was activated bilaterally, in addition to the contralateral primary motor and somatosensory cortex activation. Finally, when the subject was asked to remain still but to mentally rehearse the complex sequence of activity, the SMA was still active, even though the primary motor and somatosensory cortex areas were silent."
"Thus, the SMA appears to be involved in bilateral movements and in the mental rehearsal of these movements. SMA is involved in the transformation of kinematic to dynamic information. Movements can be defined in terms of dynamics  and kinematics ."
"Many movement plans are represented in kinematic terms . However, the motor system must eventually translate this to a representation based on dynamics, in order to instruct the appropriate muscles to contract with the appropriate force. Recordings from monkeys have shown that during the preparatory delay before a monkey makes an instructed movement, some SMA neurons change their firing correlates from a kinematic-based representation to a dynamics-based representation, suggesting that SMA plays a vital role in this transformation."
"The fourth level of the motor hierarchy is the association cortex, in particular the prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex . These brain areas are not motor areas in the strict sense. Their activity does not correlate precisely with individual motor acts, and stimulation of these areas does not result in motor output."
"However, these areas are necessary to ensure that movements are adaptive to the needs of the organism and appropriate to the behavioral context. Posterior parietal cortex is involved in ensuring that movements are targeted accurately to objects in external space. This area is involved in processing spatial relationships of objects in the world and in constructing a representation of external space that is independent of the observer’s eye position or body position."
"Such representations allow a stable percept of the world that is independent of viewer orientation, as well as the representation of desired trajectories in space that are independent of body position. Damage to the posterior parietal cortex can result in a number of apraxias, that is, the inability to make complex, coordinated movements. For example, a patient with constructional apraxia is unable to replicate the configuration of a set of blocks in the proper sequence, even though the patient is able to maneuver each block individually with dexterity."
Prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection of appropriate actions for a particular behavioral context. It is also involved in the evaluation of the consequences of a particular course of action. Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex have problems in executive processing.
"They make inappropriate behavioral decisions, and often cannot anticipate the likely consequences of their actions. They display impulsive behavior, often showing an inability to delay instant gratification for a long-term larger reward. The previous three chapters have described the anatomy and function of the four levels of the motor system hierarchy: the spinal cord, the brainstem, the motor cortex, and the association cortex."
Two other brain structures can be considered as “side loops” in the motor hierarchy. They influence the processing of motor control and modulate the output of the descending pathways without directly causing motor output. Both of these structures—the basal ganglia and the cerebellum—are now known to have other functions in addition to modulating motor control.
"Because the most obvious clinical signs of damage to these areas are a wide variety of motor impairments, they are still generally considered to be motor structures. Basal ganglia dysfunction causes a set of symptoms that are quite different from damage to descending motor pathways, and thus the basal ganglia were at one time considered to form an “extrapyramidal motor system” that was distinct from the pyramidal tract pathways. It is now known that the basal ganglia do not originate a separate motor pathway."
"Instead, they influence and modulate the activity of motor cortex and the descending motor pathways in ways that cause distinct symptoms when different basal ganglia structures are damaged. The basal ganglia comprise a distributed set of brain structures in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon . The forebrain structures include the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the nucleus accumbens  and the globus pallidus."
"Together, these structures are named the corpus striatum. The caudate nucleus is a C-shaped structure that is closely associated with the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle. It is largest at its anterior pole , and its size diminishes posteriorly as it follows the course of the lateral ventricle  all the way to the temporal lobe , where it terminates at the amygdaloid nuclei."
"The putamen is also a large structure that is separated from the caudate nucleus by the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The putamen is connected to the caudate head by bridges of cells that cut across the internal capsule. Because of the striated appearance of these cell bridges , the caudate and putamen are collectively referred to as the striatum or neostriatum, and the nucleus accumbens is often called the ventral striatum."
"Functionally, the caudate nucleus and the putamen are considered equivalent to each other; indeed, most mammals have only a single nucleus called the striatum. It is unclear whether there is any functional significance of the separation of the striatum into the caudate and putamen in primates. The putamen and the globus pallidus are collectively called the lenticular nucleus, or lentiform nucleus."
"The globus pallidus is divided into two segments: the internal  segment and the external  segment. The subthalamic nucleus is part of the diencephalon; as its name implies, it is located just below the thalamus. The substantia nigra is a midbrain structure, composed of two distinct parts: the pars compacta and the pars reticulata."
"The substantia nigra is located between the red nucleus and the crus cerebri  on the ventral part of the midbrain. The pars compacta is the source of a clinically important dopaminergic pathway to the striatum; loss of neurons in this area is the cause of Parkinson’s disease . An area that is functionally analogous to the substantia nigra pars compacta is the ventral tegmental area, which is located nearby and makes a dopaminergic projection to the nucleus accumbens."
"Historically, the amygdaloid complex and the claustrum were considered parts of the basal ganglia. However, modern usage usually restricts the term to those structures that cause the motor impairments characteristic of the extrapyramidal syndrome . The striatum is the main recipient of afferents to the basal ganglia ."
"These excitatory afferents arise from the entire cerebral cortex and from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus . The projections from different cortical areas are segregated, such that the frontal lobe projects predominantly to the caudate head and the putamen; the parietal and occipital lobes project to the caudate body; and the temporal lobe projects to the caudate tail. The primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex project mainly to the putamen, whereas the premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas project to the caudate head."
"Other cortical areas project primarily to the caudate. Thus, along the C-shaped extent of the caudate nucleus, the caudate cells receive their input from the cortical regions that are close by. The enlarged head of the caudate reflects the large projection from the frontal cortex to the caudate."
"In addition, the nucleus accumbens  receives a large input from limbic cortex. In the motor regions of the basal ganglia, there is a motor homunculus similar to that seen in the primary motor cortex. Thus, the projections from the medial wall of the anterior paracentral lobule  innervate regions of the striatum that are next to the recipient zones from the dorsal surface of the precentral gyrus ."
"Similarly, the projections from the lateral surface of the precentral gyrus  innervate regions that are next to the arm and hand representation. This topography of projections is maintained in the intrinsic circuitry of the basal ganglia. The major output structures of the basal ganglia are the globus pallidus internal segment  and the substantia nigra pars reticulata  ."
"Both of these structures make GABAergic, inhibitory connections on their targets. The GPint projects to a number of thalamic structures by way of two fiber tracts: the ansa lenticularis and the lenticular fasciculus. The loop that processes sensorimotor information from the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex projects to the ventral anterior  and ventral lateral  nuclei."
"The loop that processes other neocortical information projects to the dorsomedial nucleus , intralaminar nuclei, and parts of the VA nucleus. The SNr projects to the superior colliculus, which is involved in eye movements, as well as to the VA/VL thalamic nuclei. The striatopallidal pathway is a GABAergic, inhibitory connection between the striatum and both segments of the globus pallidus."
"The striatonigral pathway is a GABAergic, inhibitory connection between the striatum and the SNr. The globus pallidus external segment makes a GABAergic, inhibitory connection to the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus makes glutamatergic, excitatory connections onto both segments of the globus pallidus and the SNr."
"This pathway is the only purely excitatory pathway among the intrinsic pathways of the basal ganglia. The nigrostriatal pathway makes a dopaminergic synapse onto striatal neurons. As we will see below, this is a mixed pathway, with excitatory effects on some striatal neurons and inhibitory effects on others."
There are two distinct pathways that process signals through the basal ganglia: the direct pathway and the indirect pathway. These two pathways have opposite net effects on thalamic target structures. Excitation of the direct pathway has the net effect of exciting thalamic neurons .
"Excitation of the indirect pathway has the net effect of inhibiting thalamic neurons . The normal functioning of the basal ganglia apparently involves a proper balance between the activity of these two pathways. One hypothesis is that the direct pathway selectively facilitates certain motor  programs in the cerebral cortex that are adaptive for the present task, whereas the indirect pathway simultaneously inhibits the execution of competing motor programs."
"An upset of the balance between the direct and indirect pathways results in the motor dysfunctions that characterize the extrapyramidal syndrome . Direct pathway. Although the connectivity patterns of the direct and indirect pathways are relatively straightforward, the predominance of inhibitory connections in the system can make an understanding of the functional circuitry complicated and non-intuitive ."
"The direct pathway starts with cells in the striatum that make inhibitory connections with cells in the GPint. The GPint cells in turn make inhibitory connections on cells in the thalamus. Thus, the firing of GPint neurons inhibits the thalamus, making the thalamus less likely to excite the neocortex."
"When the direct pathway striatal neurons fire, however, they inhibit the activity of the GPint neurons. This inhibition releases the thalamic neurons from inhibition , allowing them to fire to excite the cortex. Thus, because of the “double negative” in the pathway between the striatum and GPint and the GPint and thalamus, the net result of exciting the direct pathway striatal neurons is to excite motor cortex."
Because the two negative numbers cancel each other out. Indirect pathway. The indirect pathway starts with a different set of cells in the striatum.
"These neurons make inhibitory connections to the external segment of the globus pallidus . The GPext neurons make inhibitory connections to cells in the subthalamic nucleus, which in turn make excitatory connections to cells in the GPint. As we saw before, the GPint neurons make inhibitory connections on the thalamic neurons."
"To see the net effects of activation of the indirect pathway, let us work backwards from the GPint. When the GPint cells are active, they inhibit thalamic neurons, thus making cortex less active. When the subthalamic neurons are firing, they increase the firing rate of GPint neurons, thus increasing the net inhibition on cortex."
"Firing of the GPext neurons inhibits the subthalamic neurons, thus making the GPint neurons less active and disinhibiting the thalamus. However, when the indirect pathway striatal neurons are active, they inhibit the GPext neurons, thus disinhibiting the subthalamic neurons. With the subthalamic neurons free to fire, the GPint neurons inhibit the thalamus, thereby producing a net inhibition on the motor cortex."
"Because there are 3 negative numbers in the equation, the net effect is negative. Thus, as a result of the complex sequences of excitation, inhibition, and disinhibition, the net effect of the cortex exciting the direct pathway is to further excite the cortex , whereas the net effect of cortex exciting the indirect pathway is to inhibit the cortex . Presumably, the function of the basal ganglia is related to a proper balance between these two pathways."
"Motor cortex neurons have to excite the proper direct pathway neurons to further increase their own firing, and they have to excite the proper indirect pathways neurons that will inhibit other motor cortex neurons that are not adaptive for the task at hand . An important pathway in the modulation of the direct and indirect pathways is the dopaminergic, nigrostriatal projection from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum . Direct pathway striatal neurons have D1 dopamine receptors, which depolarize the cell in response to dopamine."
"In contrast, indirect pathway striatal neurons have D2 dopamine receptors, which hyperpolarize the cell in response to dopamine. The nigrostriatal pathway thus has the dual effect of exciting the direct pathway while simultaneously inhibiting the indirect pathway. Because of this dual effect, excitation of the nigrostriatal pathway has the net effect of exciting cortex by two routes, by exciting the direct pathway  and inhibiting the indirect pathway ."
"The loss of these dopamine neurons in Parkinson’s disease causes the poverty of movement that characterizes this disease, as the balance between direct pathway excitation of cortex and indirect pathway inhibition of cortex is tipped in favor of the indirect pathway, with a subsequent pathological global inhibition of motor cortex areas. The function of the basal ganglia in motor control is not understood in detail. It appears that the basal ganglia is involved in the enabling of practiced motor acts and in gating the initiation of voluntary movements by modulating motor programs stored in the motor cortex and elsewhere in the motor hierarchy ."
"Thus, voluntary movements are not initiated in the basal ganglia ; however, proper functioning of the basal ganglia appears to be necessary in order for the motor cortex to relay the appropriate motor commands to the lower levels of the hierarchy. Recall that the major output from the basal ganglia is an inhibitory connection from the GPint  to the thalamus . Studies of eye movements in monkeys have shed light on the function of the basal ganglia loop."
"Normally, the SNr neurons are tonically active, suppressing the output of the collicular neurons that control saccadic eye movements. When the direct pathway striatal neurons are excited by the cortical frontal eye fields, the SNr neurons are momentarily inhibited, releasing the collicular neurons from inhibition. This allows the appropriate collicular neurons to signal the target of the eye movement, allowing the monkey to change its gaze to a new location."
"The movement was initiated in the frontal eye fields; however, the proper activation of the eye movement required that collicular neurons be released from the inhibition of the basal ganglia. What is the function of the tonic inhibitory output of the basal ganglia? Recall from the Motor Cortex chapter that stimulating the motor cortex of monkeys at various locations results in stereotyped sequences of movements, such as bringing the hand to the mouth or adopting a defensive posture."
"It appears that a number of “primitive” motor programs are stored in the cortex, and motor control may require the activation of these elemental motor programs in the precise temporal order to accomplish a sophisticated motor plan. It is important that only one motor program be active at a given time, however, such that one motor act  is not competing with a conflicting motor act . It is thought that the basal ganglia is normally active in suppressing inappropriate motor programs, and that activation of the direct pathway temporarily releases one motor program from inhibition, enabling it to be executed by the organism."
"Thus, the basal ganglia act as a gate that enables the execution of automatic programs in the hierarchy. Which motor programs should be released from inhibition at a given moment? The basal ganglia may have a major role in learning what motor acts result in rewards for the organism."
"This information is provided by the dopaminergic neurons of the SNc and ventral tegmental nucleus. Recordings from these neurons in monkeys have shown that they tend to respond when the monkey receives an unexpected reward, and they tend to be inhibited when the monkey fails to receive an expected reward . Because the net effect of activation of the nigrostriatal pathway is to excite the direct pathway and inhibit the indirect pathway, this pattern of dopaminergic firing may be involved in tuning the relative balance of direct/indirect pathway activity to enhance the firing of cortical motor programs that produce rewarding outcomes and to suppress the activity of motor programs that do not result in reward."
"In this way, motor habits can be constructed that tend to reward the animal. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of cortical loops through the basal ganglia that involve prefrontal association cortex and limbic cortex. Through these loops, the basal ganglia are thought to play a role in cognitive function that is similar to their role in motor control."
"That is, the basal ganglia are involved in selecting and enabling various cognitive, executive, or emotional programs that are stored in these other cortical areas. Moreover, the basal ganglia appear to be involved in certain types of learning. For example, in rodents the striatum is necessary for the animal to learn certain stimulus-response tasks ."
"Recordings from rat striatal neurons show that early in training, striatal neurons fire at many locations while a rat learns such a task on a T-shaped maze . This suggests that initially the striatum is involved throughout the execution of the task. As the animal learns the task and becomes exceedingly good at its performance, the striatal neurons change their activity patterns, firing only at the beginning of the trial and at the end."
"It appears that the learned programs to solve this task are now stored elsewhere; the firing of the striatal neurons at the beginning of the maze presumably reflects the enabling of the appropriate motor/cognitive plan in the cortex, and the firing at the end of the maze is presumably involved in evaluating the reward outcome of the trial. In humans, the basal ganglia appear to be necessary for certain forms of implicit memory tasks. Like motor habit learning discussed above, many types of cognitive learning require repeated trials and are often unconscious."
"An example is probabilistic classification . In this type of task, people have to learn to classify objects based on the probability of belonging to a class, rather than on any explicit rule. In one experiment, subjects were shown a deck of cards with different symbols."
"Each symbol was associated with a certain probability of predicting rain or sunshine, and the subjects had to say on each trial whether the symbol was a predictor of rain or sunshine. Because the same symbol sometimes predicted sunshine and other times predicted rain, the subjects could not devise a simple rule, and they made many errors at first. Over time, however, they began to get better at classifying the symbols appropriately, although they still often claimed to be guessing."
"Patients with basal ganglia disorders were impaired at this task, suggesting that the processing of the cognitive loops of the basal ganglia are somehow involved in our ability to subconsciously learn the probabilities of predicted outcomes associated with particular stimuli. A number of neurological disorders result from damage to the basal ganglia. Two of these disorders  will be briefly discussed here to relate the concepts learned in this chapter to the symptoms of the disorders."
"More thorough treatment of these disorders will be given in the chapter on Disorders of the Nervous System. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by slowness or absence of movement , rigidity, and a resting tremor . Patients have difficulty initiating movements, and once initiated the movements are abnormally slow."
"The cause of Parkinson’s disease is the loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . From one’s knowledge of the effects of the nigrostriatal pathway on the direct and indirect pathways, it becomes straightforward to see why the loss of this pathway results in the poverty of movement symptomatic of Parkinson’s disease. Because the nigrostriatal pathway excites the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway, the loss of this input tips the balance in favor of activity in the indirect pathway."
"Thus, the GPint neurons are abnormally active, keeping the thalamic neurons inhibited. Without the thalamic input, the motor cortex neurons are not as excited, and therefore the motor system is less able to execute the motor plans in response to the patient’s volition. The symptoms of Huntington’s disease are in many respects the opposite of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease."
"Huntington’s disease is characterized by choreiform movements: involuntary, continuous movement of the body, especially of the extremities and face. Often these movements resemble pieces of adaptive movements, but they occur involuntarily and without behavioral significance. Huntington’s disease results from the selective loss of striatal neurons in the indirect pathway ."
"Thus, the balance between the direct and indirect pathways becomes tipped in favor of the direct pathway. Without the normal inhibitory influence on the thalamus that is provided by the indirect pathway, thalamic neurons can fire randomly and inappropriately, causing the motor cortex to execute motor programs with no control by the patient. The cerebellum  is a structure that is located at the back of the brain, underlying the occipital and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex ."
"Although the cerebellum accounts for approximately 10% of the brain’s volume, it contains over 50% of the total number of neurons in the brain. Historically, the cerebellum has been considered a motor structure, because cerebellar damage leads to impairments in motor control and posture and because the majority of the cerebellum’s outputs are to parts of the motor system. Motor commands are not initiated in the cerebellum; rather, the cerebellum modifies the motor commands of the descending pathways to make movements more adaptive and accurate."
"The cerebellum is involved in the following functions:  Maintenance of balance and posture. The cerebellum is important for making postural adjustments in order to maintain balance. Through its input from vestibular receptors and proprioceptors, it modulates commands to motor neurons to compensate for shifts in body position or changes in load upon muscles."
"Patients with cerebellar damage suffer from balance disorders, and they often develop stereotyped postural strategies to compensate for this problem . Coordination of voluntary movements. Most movements are composed of a number of different muscle groups acting together in a temporally coordinated fashion."
One major function of the cerebellum is to coordinate the timing and force of these different muscle groups to produce fluid limb or body movements. Motor learning. The cerebellum is important for motor learning.
"The cerebellum plays a major role in adapting and fine-tuning motor programs to make accurate movements through a trial-and-error process . Cognitive functions. Although the cerebellum is most understood in terms of its contributions to motor control, it is also involved in certain cognitive functions, such as language."
"Thus, like the basal ganglia, the cerebellum is historically considered as part of the motor system, but its functions extend beyond motor control in ways that are not yet well understood. The cerebellum consists of two major parts . The cerebellar deep nuclei  are the sole output structures of the cerebellum."
"These nuclei are encased by a highly convoluted sheet of tissue called the cerebellar cortex, which contains almost all of the neurons in the cerebellum. A cross-section through the cerebellum reveals the intricate pattern of folds and fissures that characterize the cerebellar cortex . Like the cerebral cortex, cerebellar gyri are reproducible across individuals and have been identified and named."
We will only be concerned with some of the larger divisions of the cerebellar cortex. Divisions of the cerebellum. Two major fissures running mediolaterally divide the cerebellar cortex into three primary subdivisions .
"The posterolateral fissure separates the flocculonodular lobe from the corpus cerebelli, and the primary fissure separates the corpus cerebelli into a posterior lobe and an anterior lobe . The cerebellum is also divided sagittally into three zones that run from medial to lateral . The vermis  is located along the midsagittal plane of the cerebellum."
"Directly lateral to the vermis is the intermediate zone. Finally, the lateral hemispheres are located lateral to the intermediate zone . Cerebellar nuclei."
"All outputs from the cerebellum originate from the cerebellar deep nuclei. Thus, a lesion to the cerebellar nuclei has the same effect as a complete lesion of the entire cerebellum. It is important to know the inputs, outputs, and anatomical relationships between the different cerebellar nuclei and the subdivisions of the cerebellum ."
"The fastigial nucleus is the most medially located of the cerebellar nuclei. It receives input from the vermis and from cerebellar afferents that carry vestibular, proximal somatosensory, auditory, and visual information. It projects to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation."
"The interposed nuclei comprise the emboliform nucleus and the globose nucleus. They are situated lateral to the fastigial nucleus. They receive input from the intermediate zone and from cerebellar afferents that carry spinal, proximal somatosensory, auditory, and visual information."
"They project to the contralateral red nucleus . The dentate nucleus is the largest of the cerebellar nuclei, located lateral to the interposed nuclei. It receives input from the lateral hemisphere and from cerebellar afferents that carry information from the cerebral cortex ."
"It projects to the contralateral red nucleus and the ventrolateral  thalamic nucleus. The vestibular nuclei are located outside the cerebellum, in the medulla. Hence, they are not strictly cerebellar nuclei, but they are considered to be functionally equivalent to the cerebellar nuclei because their connectivity patterns are identical to the cerebellar nuclei."
"The vestibular nuclei receive input from the flocculonodular lobe and from the vestibular labyrinth. They project to various motor nuclei and originate the vestibulospinal tracts. In addition to these inputs, all cerebellar nuclei and all regions of cerebellum get special inputs from the inferior olive of the medulla ."
"It is convenient to remember that the anatomical locations of the cerebellar nuclei correspond to the cerebellar cortex regions from which they receive input. Thus, the medially located fastigial nucleus receives input from the medially located vermis; the slightly lateral interposed nuclei receive input from the slightly lateral intermediate zone; and the most lateral dentate nucleus receives input from the lateral hemispheres. Cerebellar peduncles."
"Three fiber bundles carry the input and output of the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle  primarily contains afferent fibers from the medulla, as well as efferents to the vestibular nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle  primarily contains afferents from the pontine nuclei."
"The superior cerebellar peduncle  primarily contains efferent fibers from the cerebellar nuclei, as well as some afferents from the spinocerebellar tract. Thus, the inputs to the cerebellum are conveyed primarily through the inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles, whereas the outputs are conveyed primarily through the superior cerebellar peduncle. The inputs arise from the ipsilateral side of the body, and the outputs also go to the ipsilateral side of the body."
"Note that this is true even for the outputs to the contralateral red nucleus. Recall from the chapter on descending motor pathways that the rubrospinal tract immediately crosses the midline after the fibers leave the red nucleus. Thus, cerebellar output to the red nucleus affects the ipsilateral side of the body by a double-crossed pathway."
"Unlike the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum receives input from, and controls output to, the ipsilateral side of the body, and damage to the cerebellum therefore results in deficits to the ipsilateral side of the body. The anatomical subdivisions described above correspond to three major functional subdivisions of the cerebellum. Vestibulocerebellum."
"The vestibulocerebellum comprises the flocculonodular lobe and its connections with the lateral vestibular nuclei. Phylogenetically, the vestibulocerebellum is the oldest part of the cerebellum. As its name implies, it is involved in vestibular reflexes  and in postural maintenance."
"Spinocerebellum. The spinocerebellum comprises the vermis and the intermediate zones of the cerebellar cortex, as well as the fastigial and interposed nuclei. As its name implies, it receives major inputs from the spinocerebellar tract."
"Its output projects to rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, and reticulospinal tracts. It is involved in the integration of sensory input with motor commands to produce adaptive motor coordination. Cerebrocerebellum."
"The cerebrocerebellum is the largest functional subdivision of the human cerebellum, comprising the lateral hemispheres and the dentate nuclei. Its name derives from its extensive connections with the cerebral cortex, via the pontine nuclei  and the VL thalamus . It is involved in the planning and timing of movements."
"In addition, the cerebrocerebellum is involved in the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex is divided into three layers . The innermost layer, the granule cell layer, is made of 5 x 1010 small, tightly packed granule cells."
"The middle layer, the Purkinje cell layer, is only 1-cell thick. The outer layer, the molecular layer, is made of the axons of granule cells and the dendrites of Purkinje cells, as well as a few other cell types. The Purkinje cell layer forms the border between the granule and molecular layers."
"Granule cells. Granule cells are very small, densely packed neurons that account for the huge majority of neurons in the cerebellum. Indeed, cerebellar granule cells account for more than half of the neurons in the entire brain."
These cells receive input from mossy fibers and project to the Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cell is one of the most striking cell types in the mammalian brain.
"Its apical dendrites form a large fan of finely branched processes . Remarkably, this dendritic tree is almost two-dimensional; looked at from the side, the dendritic tree is flat . Moreover, all Purkinje cells are oriented in parallel."
"This arrangement has important functional considerations, as we shall see below. Other cell types. In addition to the major cell types , the cerebellar cortex also contains various interneuron types, including the Golgi cell, the basket cell, and the stellate cell."
"Connectivity. The cerebellar cortex has a relatively simple, stereotyped connectivity pattern that is identical throughout the whole structure. Figure 6 illustrates a simplified diagram of the connectivity of the cerebellum."
"Cerebellar input can be divided into two distinct classes. Mossy fibers originate in the pontine nuclei, the spinal cord, the brainstem reticular formation, and the vestibular nuclei, and they make excitatory projections onto the cerebellar nuclei and onto granule cells in the cerebellar cortex. They are called mossy fibers because of the tufted appearance of their synaptic contacts with granule cells."
"There is a large degree of divergence in the mossy fiber-granule cell connection, as each mossy fiber innervates hundreds of granule cells. The granule cells send axons up toward the cortical surface. Each axon bifurcates in the molecular layer, sending a collateral in opposite directions."
"These fibers, called parallel fibers, run parallel to the folds of the cerebellar cortex, where they make excitatory synapses with Purkinje cells along the way . The two-dimensional arbors of the Purkinje cell dendrites are oriented perpendicular to the parallel fibers. Thus, the arrangement of Purkinje cells and parallel fibers resembles telephone lines running between telephone poles."
"Each parallel fiber makes contact with hundreds of Purkinje cells; because of the high degree of divergence of the mossy fiber-granule cell synapses, the firing of each Purkinje cell can be influenced  by thousands of mossy fibers. Climbing fibers originate exclusively in the inferior olive and make excitatory projections onto the cerebellar nuclei and onto the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. They are called climbing fibers because their axons climb and wrap around the dendrites of the Purkinje cell like a climbing vine."
"Each Purkinje cell receives a single, extremely powerful input from a single climbing fiber. In contrast to mossy fibers and parallel fibers, each climbing fiber contacts only 10 Purkinje cells on average, making ~300 synapses with each Purkinje cell. Thus, the climbing fiber is a restricted, but extremely powerful, excitatory input onto Purkinje cells."
The Purkinje cell is the sole source of output from the cerebellar cortex. It is important to note that Purkinje cells make inhibitory connections onto the cerebellar nuclei. Almost all of the spikes generated by the Purkinje cell are caused by its parallel-fiber inputs.
"These inputs cause the Purkinje cell to fire at a high resting rate , tonically inhibiting its cerebellar nucleus targets. The powerful inputs from climbing fibers occur less frequently ; thus, they have a minor influence on the overall firing rate of the Purkinje cell. The Purkinje cell spikes that are generated by climbing fibers are calcium-spikes, however, which allow the climbing fibers to initiate a number of calcium-dependent changes in the Purkinje cell."
"As described below, one important change appears to be a long-lasting change in the strength of the parallel-fiber inputs to the Purkinje cell. Much of what is known about cerebellar function comes from studies of patients with cerebellar damage. In general, such patients display uncoordinated voluntary movements and problems maintaining balance and posture."
"The following are some symptoms of cerebellar damage :  Decomposition of movement. Most of our movements involve the coordinated activity of many muscle groups and different joints to produce a smooth trajectory of the body part through space. Patients with cerebellar dysfunction are unable to produce these coordinated, smooth movements."
"Instead, they often break the movements down into their component parts in order to execute the desired trajectory. For example, touching one’s finger to one’s nose requires the coordinated activity of shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. Cerebellar patients must first perform the shoulder movement, then the elbow movement, and finally the wrist movement in sequence, rather than as one, uniform motion."
"Intention tremor. When making a movement to a target, cerebellar patients often produce an involuntary tremor that increases as they approach closer to the target. For example, if reaching for a cup, the hand starts out in a direct line toward the cup; as it gets closer, however, the hand begins to move back and forth as it attempts to make contact with the cup."
"Dysdiadochokinesia. Patients have difficulty performing rapidly alternating movements, such as hitting a surface rapidly and repeatedly with the palm and back of the hand. Deficits in motor learning."
Experimental studies have demonstrated that cerebellar damage causes deficits in motor learning in both human patients and experimental animals. One prominent experimental model is the vestibuloocular reflex . This reflex allows us to maintain gaze on an object when the head is rotated .
"Vestibular signals detect the head movement, and send signals through the cerebellum to the eye muscles to precisely counter the head rotation and maintain a stable center of gaze. The motor commands to the eyes must be calibrated precisely with experience, and this calibration appears to be the job of the cerebellum. Experiments have been performed in which subjects wore prisms that magnified the visual image."
"When the subjects’ heads were moved, the VOR caused the visual image to shift on the retina rather than remaining stable. Over days, however, the VOR slowly adjusted, such that the proper compensatory eye movements were made to keep the retinal image stable when the head was rotated. In experimental animals, lesions to the cerebellum prevent this adjustment of the VOR."
"A second example of cerebellum-dependent motor learning involves the execution of accurate, coordinated movements. Subjects wore prism goggles that shifted the visual image to the right, and they were asked to then throw balls at a target on the wall. Because of the prisms, the accuracy of the subjects was initially quite low, as the balls consistently hit to the left of the target."
"With repeated practice, however, the subjects became more and more accurate at hitting the target. When the goggles were removed, the subject now began to throw the balls to the right of the target, because their motor programs had been recalibrated to use the shifted visual input. Over time, once again, they gradually increased their accuracy."
"Patients with cerebellar damage never learned to compensate for the prism, as their balls always landed to the left of the target when the goggles were worn. When the goggles were removed, they were immediately accurate at hitting the target, because they never made compensations for the earlier prism trials. A third example involves the Pavlovian classical conditioning of the eye blink reflex."
"In this task, a neutral stimulus  is paired with a noxious stimulus  that causes a reflexive eye blink. Over time, experimental animals will learn to close their eye when the tone occurs, in anticipation of the air puff. This learned eyelid closure is remarkably well-timed to peak at the expected time of the puff."
Animals with cerebellar damage do not learn to produce the eyelid closure in response to the tone. What do the various symptoms of cerebellar damage have in common that reveal the function of the cerebellum? A number of different theories have been proposed.
"Recall the discussion in Chapter 1 of the ubiquitous use of sensory information in motor control. The cerebellum receives extensive sensory input, and it appears to use this input to guide movements in both a feedback and feedforward control manner. In a feedback controller, a desired output is compared continuously with the actual output, and adjustments are made during the execution of the movement until the actual movement matches the desired movement."
"A common example of a feedback control system is the thermostat in your home . The thermostat is set to a desired temperature , and a thermometer measures the current temperature in the room. If the thermostat  detects that the room is cooler than the desired temperature, it sends an error signal that turns on the furnace."
"If the comparator detects that the room is warmer than the desired setting, its sends an error signal that turns on the air conditioner. Feedback control systems can produce very accurate outputs; however, in general they are slow. In order to change the output, the effector must wait until information is transmitted from the sensor to the comparator and then to the effector."
"At this point, another comparison is made, and the process continues. Consider further the thermostat example. If the temperature reads 5° cooler than desired, the thermostat can instruct the furnace to turn on at a moderate heat."
"It reads the new room temperature, and, if it is still too cool, it instructs the furnace to deliver more heat, and so on. Although this will eventually produce an accurate room temperature at the desired point, it takes a number of cycles to reach that point. One possible solution for quicker results would be to turn an enormous furnace on full-blast, such that is heats the room very quickly."
"This solution, however, can generate another problem. It will tend to cause the system to oscillate if the feedback pathways are slow. For example, assume that the furnace can heat the room at the rate of 5° per second, but that it takes 2 seconds for the thermometer to adjust to the new temperature, and for the new error signal to turn the furnace off."
"In those 2 seconds, the furnace has heated the room up 10°, and now it is too warm. So the error signal turns on the air conditioner, and it cools the room at 5°/sec. Of course, it also takes 2 sec to receive the feedback, and by the time it is told to shut off, it has cooled the room by 10°."
"You can see what happens: the system will be sent into an endless oscillation of being 5° too hot and 5° too cold. In order for a feedback system to work well, the transmission time of sensory information through the comparator to the effector must be rapid compared to the time of the action. Feedback control systems work well only when the sensory feedback about the actual output is fast relative to the actual output."
"If the actual output is faster than the sensor’s ability to provide feedback, then the system will tend to oscillate between overshooting and undershooting the desired output. Thus, a feedback controller is useful for slow movements, like postural adjustments. The role of the myotatic reflex in posture maintenance is an example of a feedback controller in the spinal cord, and the cerebellum plays a role in coordinating these postural adjustments."
"Feedback control is not effective for most of the fast movements we make routinely . For these movements, a feedforward controller is needed. In a feedforward control system, when a desired output is sent to the controller, the controller evaluates sensory information about the environment and about the system itself before the output commands are generated."
"It uses the sensory information to program the best set of instructions to accomplish the desired output. However, in a pure feedforward system, once the commands are sent, there is no way to alter them . The advantage of a feedforward system is that it can produce the precise set of commands for the effector without needing to constantly check the output and make corrections during the movement itself."
"The main disadvantage, however, is that the feedforward controller requires a period of trial-and-error learning before it can function properly. In most biological systems, it is hard  to pre-program all of the possible sensory conditions that the controller may encounter during the life of the organism. Furthermore, the environment and conditions under which actions are made are constantly changing, and the feedforward controller must be able to adapt its output commands to account for these changes."
"Let us extend the thermostat example to see how a temperature controller operating as a feedforward system would work to raise the temperature of a room from 70° to 75°. The controller would use diverse sensory information about the environment before sending its command to the furnace . For example, it would read the current temperature, the current humidity level, the size of the room, the number of people in the room, and so forth."
"Based on this information, it would direct the furnace to turn on for a pre-set period of time, and that’s it. There would be no need to continually compare the current temperature with the desired setting, as the system has predetermined how long the furnace needs to be working in order to achieve the desired temperature. How did the controller obtain this information?"
"A feedforward controller requires a large amount of experience in order to learn the appropriate actions needed for each set of environmental conditions. If on one trial it turns the furnace off too soon and the room does not reach the desired temperature, it adjusts its programming such that the next time it encounters the same environmental conditions, it turns the furnace on for a longer period of time. Through many such instances of trial and error learning, the feedforward system creates a “look-up table” that tells it how long the furnace needs to be active under the current conditions."
"The key distinction between a feedback and feedforward system is that the feedback system uses sensory information to generate an error signal during the control of a movement, whereas a feedforward system uses sensory information in advance of a movement. Any error signal about the final output is used by the feedforward system only to change its programming of future movements. The cerebellar involvement in the VOR may be explained in terms of the learning requirements of a feedforward controller."
"When the head moves, a compensatory eye movement must be made to maintain a stable gaze. The cerebellum receives sensory input from the vestibular system informing it that the head is moving. It also receives input from eye muscle proprioceptors and other relevant sources of information about current conditions in order to make an accurate compensatory eye movement."
"It evaluates all of this advance sensory information and calculates the proper eye movement to exactly counterbalance the head movement. What if the eye movement does not match the head movement, however, and the visual image moves across the retina ? The retinal slip constitutes an error signal to tell the cerebellum that next time these conditions are met, adjust the eye movement to decrease the retinal slip."
"This trial and error sequence will be repeated until the movement is properly calibrated; moreover, these mechanisms will ensure that the movements stay calibrated. As another example, the coordination of movements requires that muscle groups be activated in precise temporal sequence. Not only do the different joints need to be coordinated temporally, but even antagonist muscles that control the same joint need precise temporal coordination."
"For example, an extensor muscle needs to be activated to start a reaching movement, and the corresponding flexor muscle needs to be activated at the end of the movement to stop the movement appropriately. The precise timing of muscle contractions and the force necessary for each contraction varies with the amount of load placed on a muscle, as well as on the inherent properties of the muscle itself . These variables are constantly changing throughout life, as one grows, gains/loses weights, and ages."
"Moreover, a similar movement will require different patterns of motor activity depending on the weight being born by the muscle . The cerebellum appears necessary for the proper timing and coordination of muscle groups, very likely through a trial-and-error learning mechanism discussed previously. Such a role helps explain the deficits seen in dysdiadochokinesia, in which patients cannot perform rapidly alternating sequences of movements."
"It is believed that the mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellum convey the sensory information used to evaluate the overall sensory context of the movement. Mossy fibers are known to respond to sensory stimuli; they are also correlated with different movements . These fibers convey such information as: Where are the appropriate body parts , what is the current load on the muscle , what other sensory information can predict a useful response , what are the desired movements ."
"The error signal is believed to be conveyed by the climbing fiber inputs. Climbing fibers are known to be especially active when an unexpected event occurs, such as when a greater load than expected is placed on a muscle or when a toe is stubbed. Thus, the large divergence of input from the mossy fibers to the granule cells to the parallel fibers is believed to create complex representations of the entire sensory context at present and the desired motor output."
"When the desired output is not achieved, the climbing fibers signal this error and trigger a calcium spike in the Purkinje cell. The influx of calcium changes the connection strengths between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, such that the next time the same behavioral context occurs, the motor output will be modified to more closely approximate the desired output. The previous motor system chapters have deconstructed the motor system into its component parts, in an effort to portray how the brain’s “divide and conquer” strategy assigns different motor control tasks to different brain regions."
"This chapter describes the types of disorders that result from damage or disease to different parts of the motor system. In the process, the different components of the motor system are reviewed to see how they work together to produce the fluid, effortless body movements that we take for granted. An emphasis is placed on trying to explain the causes and symptoms of motor system disorders in terms of the basic principles of neuroanatomy and neuronal function that you learned in the earlier chapters."
"The first level of the motor system hierarchy is the spinal cord, the location of the alpha motor neurons that constitute the “final common pathway” of all motor commands. Alpha motor neurons directly innervate skeletal muscle, causing the contractions that produce all movements. Reflex circuits and other circuitry within the spinal cord underlie the automatic processing of many of the direct commands to the muscles , thereby freeing higher-order areas to concentrate on more global, task-related processing."
Motor system dysfunction can result from damage or disease at any level of the motor system hierarchy and side-loops. Differences in the symptoms that result from damage at different levels allow the clinician to localize where in the hierarchy the damage is likely to be. Damage to alpha motor neurons results in a characteristic set of symptoms called the lower motor neuron syndrome .
This damage usually arises from certain diseases that selectively affect alpha motor neurons  or from localized lesions near the spinal cord. Lower motor neuron syndrome is characterized by the following symptoms:  The effects can be limited to small groups of muscles. Recall that a motor neuron pool is a nucleus of alpha motor neurons that innervate a single muscle .
"Furthermore, nearby motor neuron pools control nearby muscles. Thus, restricted damage to lower motor neurons, either within the spinal cord or at the ventral roots, will affect only a restricted group of muscles. Muscle atrophy."
"When alpha motor neurons die, the muscle fibers that they innervate become deprived of necessary trophic factors and eventually the muscle itself atrophies. Weakness. Because of the damage to alpha motor neurons and the atrophy of muscles, weakness is profound in lower motor neuron disorders."
"Fasciculation. Damaged alpha motor neurons can produce spontaneous action potentials. These spikes cause the muscle fibers that are part of that neuron’s motor unit to fire, resulting in a visible twitch  of the affected muscle ."
"Fibrillation. With further degeneration of the alpha motor neuron, only remnants of the axons near the muscle fibers remain. These individual axon fibers can also generate spontaneous action potentials; however, these action potentials will only cause individual muscle fibers to contract."
This spontaneous twitching of individual muscle fibers is called a fibrillation . Fibrillations are too small to be seen as a visible muscle contraction. They can only be detected with electrophysiological recordings of the muscle activity .
"Hypotonia. Because alpha motor neurons are the only way to stimulate extrafusal muscle fibers, the loss of these neurons causes a decrease in muscle tone. Hyporeflexia."
"The myotatic  reflex is weak or absent with lower motor neuron disorders, because the alpha motor neurons that cause muscle contraction are damaged. Damage to any part of the motor system hierarchy above the level of alpha motor neurons  results in a set of symptoms termed the upper motor neuron syndrome. Some of these symptoms are opposite of those of lower motor neuron disorders."
"Thus, one of the critical determinations a clinician must make is whether a patient presenting with motor problems has an upper motor neuron disorder or a lower motor neuron disorder. Upper motor neuron disorders typically arise from such causes as stroke, tumors, and blunt trauma. For example, strokes to the middle cerebral artery, lateral striate artery, or the medial striate artery can cause damage to the lateral surface of cortex or to the internal capsule, where the descending axons of the corticospinal tract collect."
"The symptoms of upper motor neuron syndrome are:  The effects extend to large groups of muscles. Recall from the Motor Cortex chapter that muscles from different body parts are activated by stimulation of parts of motor cortex, consistent with the notion that motor cortex represents movements that are controlled by many joints, rather than individual muscles. Thus, a stroke in a particular part of motor cortex will affect the activation of many muscles in the body."
"Likewise, a stroke that affects the internal capsule or crus cerebri could affect muscles on the entire contralateral side of the body. Atrophy is rare. Because alpha motor neurons are present, muscles will continue to receive trophic agents necessary for their survival."
"A mild amount of atrophy may result from disuse, but it will not be as pronounced as that resulting from a lower motor neuron disorder. Weakness. Upper motor neuron disorders produce a graded weakness of movement , which differs from the complete loss of muscle activity caused by paralysis ."
"Absence of fasciculations. Because alpha motor neurons themselves are spared, fasciculations do not occur. Absence of fibrillations."
"Likewise, fibrillations do not occur. Hypertonia. Upper motor neuron disorders result in an increase in muscle tone."
"Recall that descending motor pathways can modulate the intrinsic circuitry that is present in the spinal cord. This modulatory input can be either inhibitory or excitatory. Through mechanisms that are not well understood, the loss of descending inputs tends to result in an increased firing rate of alpha and/or gamma motor neurons."
"The higher firing rate causes an increase in the resting level of muscle activity, resulting in hypertonia. Hyperreflexia. Because of the loss of inhibitory modulation from descending pathways, the myotatic  reflex is exaggerated in upper motor neuron disorders."
The stretch reflex is a major clinical diagnostic test of whether a motor disorder is caused by damage to upper or lower motor neurons. Clonus. Sometimes the stretch reflex is so strong that the muscle contracts a number of times in a 5-7 Hz oscillation when the muscle is rapidly stretched and then held at a constant length.
"This abnormal oscillation, called clonus, can be felt by the clinician. Initial contralateral flaccid paralysis. In the initial stages after damage to motor cortex, the contralateral side of the body shows a flaccid paralysis."
"Gradually, over the course of a few weeks, motor function returns to the contralateral side of the body. This gradual recovery of function results from the ability of other motor pathways to take over some of the lost functions. Recall that there are multiple descending motor pathways by which high-order information can reach the spinal cord."
"Thus, descending pathways such as the rubrospinal and the reticulospinal tracts, which receive direct or indirect cortical input, can take over the function lost by the damage to the corticospinal tract. Moreover, primary motor cortex itself is capable of reorganizing itself to recover some lost function. Thus, if the part of motor cortex that controls a certain body movement is damaged, neighboring parts of the motor cortex that are undamaged can, to some extent, alter their function to help compensate for the damaged areas."
The one major exception to the recovery of function is that fine control of the distal musculature will not be regained after a lesion to the corticospinal tract. Recall that there are direct connections from primary motor cortex neurons to alpha motor neurons controlling the fingers. These connections presumably underlie our abilities to manipulate objects with great precision and to do such tasks as playing a piano and performing microsurgery.
"None of the other descending pathways have direct connections onto spinal motor neurons, and none of them can compensate for the loss of fine motor control of the hands and fingers after damage to the corticospinal tract. Spasticity. A clinical sign of upper motor neuron disorder is a velocity dependent resistance to passive movement of the limb."
"If the clinician moves a patient’s limb slowly, there may be little resistance to the movement. As the passive movement becomes quicker, however, at a certain point the muscle will sharply resist the movement. This is referred to as a “spastic catch."
"” The mechanism for this spasticity is not entirely known, but altered firing rate of gamma motor neurons and their regulating interneurons may be involved, as well as an increase in alpha motor neuron activity, causing an inappropriately powerful stretch reflex to a fast stretch of the muscle. Sometimes, the resistance becomes so great that the autogenic inhibition reflex is initiated, causing a sudden drop in the resistance; this is referred to as the clasp-knife reflex. Babinski sign."
"A classic neurological test for corticospinal tract damage is the Babinski test. In this test, the clinician strokes the sole of the foot firmly with an instrument. This elicits a normal plantar response in normal individuals, as the toes curl inward."
"In patients with an upper motor neuron disorder, however, an abnormal extensor plantar response is elicited, as the big toe extends upward and the remaining toes fan out. This is called a positive Babinski sign . Interestingly, the positive Babinski sign is normal in infants for the first 2 years of life."
"During development, however, the reflex changes to the normal adult pattern, presumably as corticospinal circuits mature. In addition to the above symptoms, damage to the motor cortex and association cortex can result in impairments in motor planning and strategies and in an inability to perform complex motor tasks. Performance of simple tasks is intact, but patients are unable to perform complex, practiced tasks."
"This symptom is known as apraxia. For example, patients may be unable to arrange a set of blocks to match an example block-structure in front of them. They can move the blocks individually, but cannot come up with a motor plan to arrange them properly."
This disorder is known as constructional apraxia. Other apraxias include dressing apraxia  and verbal apraxia . A section or crush of the spinal cord will result in paralysis of all parts of the body below the damaged region.
"Even though such an injury occurs in the spinal cord, it is not considered a lower motor neuron disorder, as the alpha motor neurons themselves are not directly damaged. If the damage occurs at the cervical level, then all four limbs will be paralyzed . If the damage occurs below the cervical enlargement, then only the legs are paralyzed ."
"Other terms used to describe patterns of paralysis are hemiplegia  and monoplegia . The basal ganglia have historically been considered part of the motor system because of the variety of motor deficits that occur when they are damaged. The types of symptoms that result from basal ganglia disorders can be divided into two classes: dyskinesias, which are abnormal, involuntary movements, and akinesias, which are abnormal, involuntary postures."
"Because the basal ganglia were once considered to form a separate, “extrapyramidal” motor system, these symptoms are called extrapyramidal disorders. Resting tremors are most often associated with Parkinson’s disease. When the patient is at rest, certain body parts will display a 4-7 Hz tremor."
"For example, the thumb and forefingers will move back-and-forth against each other in a characteristic tremor called “pill-rolling tremor. ” The tremor stops when the body part engages in active movement. Athetosis is characterized by involuntary, writhing movements, especially of the hands and face."
"Chorea, which derives from the Greek word for “dance,” is characterized by continuous, writhing movements of the entire body. It is viewed by some as an extreme form of athetosis. Chorea is most closely identified with Huntington’s disease."
"Ballismus is characterized by involuntary, ballistic movements of the extremities. Tardive dyskinesia can result from the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs that target the dopamine system. It is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, arms, lips, and other body parts."
"It is thought to occur as the result of an imbalance between the D1 and D2 receptors, thereby favoring the direct pathway over the indirect pathway. Rigidity is a resistance to passive movement of the limb. Unlike spasticity, rigidity does not depend on the speed of the passive movement."
"In some patients, this resistance is so great that it is referred to as lead-pipe rigidity, because moving the patient’s limb feels like bending a lead pipe. In some patients, this rigidity is coupled with tremors and is called cogwheel rigidity, as moving the limb feels to the clinician like the catching and release of gears. As with spasticity, the mechanism is not entirely understood, but may result from continuous firing of alpha motor neurons causing a continual contraction of the muscle."
"Dystonia is the involuntary adoption of abnormal postures, as agonist and antagonist muscles both contract and become so rigid that the patient cannot maintain normal posture. Bradykinesia refers to a slowness, or poverty, of movement. A number of well-known movement disorders are associated with basal ganglia dysfunction."
"We shall concentrate on 3 of the most well-understood: Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and hemiballismus. To understand how these disorders result in the specific symptoms, it is necessary to review the circuit anatomy of the basal ganglia that was presented in the Basal Ganglia chapter. Parkinson’s disease results from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta."
"It is characterized by a resting tremor, but the most debilitating symptom is severe bradykinesia or akinesia. In advanced cases, patients have difficulty initiating movements, although involuntary, reflexive movements can be normal. It is as if the loss of the substantia nigra neurons has put a brake on the output of motor cortex, inhibiting voluntary motor commands from descending to the brain stem and spinal cord."
"Although the cause of Parkinson’s disease is still not known, much has been learned in the past 15 years from the development of an animal model of Parkinson’s disease. This model was discovered by accident when a number of young patients presented with symptoms remarkably similar to Parkinson’s disease. These patients were drug addicts who had been taking an artificially manufactured drug called MPTP ."
"This drug destroyed the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a Parkinsonian disorder. Laboratory animals injected with MPTP have since become a leading model for understanding the disease and developing treatments. How does the loss of the dopaminergic neurons cause the poverty of movements associated with Parkinson’s disease ?"
"Recall from the Basal Ganglia chapter that the substantia nigra pars compacta projects to both direct pathway and indirect pathways neurons in the striatum. Because there are two different types of dopamine receptors, substantia nigra activity excites the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway. The net effect of the direct pathway is to excite motor cortex, and the net effect of the indirect pathway is to inhibit motor cortex."
"Thus, the loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway upsets the fine balance of excitation and inhibition in the basal ganglia and reduces the excitation of motor cortex. In ways that are not understood, this reduction of thalamic excitation interferes with the ability of the motor cortex to generate commands for voluntary movement, resulting in the poverty of movement of Parkinsonian patients. It is as if all of the motor programs stored in cortex are constantly inhibited by the indirect pathway, with not enough excitation of the direct pathway for the desired motor program to become activated."
"There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, but a number of effective treatments exist. The earliest effective treatment was developed when it was first discovered that Parkinson’s disease was caused by a loss of dopaminergic neurons. Because dopamine itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier, L-Dopa, a chemical precursor to dopamine, was used to replenish the supply of dopamine."
"Amazingly, flooding the system with L-Dopa resulted in profound improvements in the symptoms of patients. Unfortunately, this improvement is temporary, and typically symptoms return after a number of years. Surgical intervention, such as making lesions to the globus pallidus internal segment , has shown effectiveness in some patients."
"In recent years, a new therapy, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, has been gaining in popularity. In this treatment, an electrical stimulator is implanted in the subthalamic nucleus. When the electrical current is turned on to stimulate the nucleus, the patient’s symptoms disappear immediately."
"It is not known why this procedure works, or what its long-term efficacy is. Because the projection from the subthalamic nucleus is excitatory onto globus pallidus neurons, which inhibit the thalamus, it is paradoxical that such stimulation should increase motor cortex activity. One thought is that the stimulation might actually overload the subthalamic nucleus, thereby inhibiting it and disinhibiting the thalamus."
"Huntington’s disease  is a genetic disorder that is caused by an abnormally large number of repeats of the nucleotide sequence CAG on chromosome 4. Normal individuals have 9-35 repeats of this sequence; mutations that cause larger repeats give rise to Huntington’s disease. It is an autosomal dominant mutation, such that the offspring of a patient with Huntington’s disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation."
"Individuals with the mutated gene will invariably develop Huntington’s disease, usually near middle age. The affected gene codes for a protein known as huntingtin, the function of which is not known. The effect of the mutated version of the gene, however, is to kill the indirect pathway neurons in the striatum, particularly those of the caudate nucleus."
"Huntington’s disease is also known as Huntington’s chorea because it is characterized by a continuous, choreiform movements of the body . In addition, the disease in advanced stages is associated with dementia. There is at present no cure or effective treatment for Huntington’s disease."
"Why does the loss of indirect pathway neurons in the striatum cause the dyskinesias of Huntington’s disease ? Recall that the net effect of the indirect pathway is to inhibit motor cortex. With the loss of these neurons, the excitatory effect of the direct pathway is no longer kept in check by the inhibition of the indirect pathway."
"Thus, the motor cortex gets too much excitatory input from the thalamus, disrupting its normal functioning and sending involuntary movement commands to the brain stem and spinal cord. Because inappropriate motor programs are not inhibited normally, the cortex continuously sends involuntary commands for movements and movement sequences to the muscles. Huntington’s disease  is a genetic disorder that is caused by an abnormally large number of repeats of the nucleotide sequence CAG on chromosome 4."
"Normal individuals have 9-35 repeats of this sequence; mutations that cause larger repeats give rise to Huntington’s disease. It is an autosomal dominant mutation, such that the offspring of a patient with Huntington’s disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Individuals with the mutated gene will invariably develop Huntington’s disease, usually near middle age."
"The affected gene codes for a protein known as huntingtin, the function of which is not known. The effect of the mutated version of the gene, however, is to kill the indirect pathway neurons in the striatum, particularly those of the caudate nucleus. Huntington’s disease is also known as Huntington’s chorea because it is characterized by a continuous, choreiform movements of the body ."
"In addition, the disease in advanced stages is associated with dementia. There is at present no cure or effective treatment for Huntington’s disease. Why does the loss of indirect pathway neurons in the striatum cause the dyskinesias of Huntington’s disease ?"
"Recall that the net effect of the indirect pathway is to inhibit motor cortex. With the loss of these neurons, the excitatory effect of the direct pathway is no longer kept in check by the inhibition of the indirect pathway. Thus, the motor cortex gets too much excitatory input from the thalamus, disrupting its normal functioning and sending involuntary movement commands to the brain stem and spinal cord."
"Because inappropriate motor programs are not inhibited normally, the cortex continuously sends involuntary commands for movements and movement sequences to the muscles. Like the basal ganglia, the cerebellum has historically been considered part of the motor system because damage to it produces motor disturbances. Unlike the basal ganglia, damage to the cerebellum does not result in lack of movement or poverty of movement."
"Instead, cerebellar dysfunction is characterized by a lack of movement coordination. Also unlike basal ganglia , damage to the cerebellum causes impairments on the ipsilateral side of the body. Ataxia is a general term used to describe the general impairments in movement coordination and accuracy that accompany cerebellar damage."
"There are two major forms of cerebellar ataxia. Disturbances of posture or gait result from lesions to the vestibulocerebellum. Patients have difficulty maintaining posture because of the loss of the fine-control mechanisms programmed by cerebellar circuits that translate vestibular signals into precise, well-timed muscle contractions to counter small sways in the body."
"As a result, patients often develop abnormal gait and stances to compensate. For example, the feet are often spaced widely apart when the patient stands still, as this provides a more stable base to maintain balance. In addition, patients display a staggering gait, with a tendency to fall toward the side of the lesion."
"This gait resembles that of a drunken individual; indeed, alcohol is known to affect the firing of Purkinje cells, which may explain the loss of coordination that accompanies inebriation. Decomposition of movement results from the loss of the cerebellum’s ability to coordinate the activity and timing of many muscle groups to produce smooth, fluid movements. Instead, cerebellar patient decompose each movement into its component parts, performing them in serial, rather than all at once in a coordinated fashion."
"Dysmetria refers to the inappropriate force and distance that characterizes target-directed movements of cerebellar patients. For example, in attempting to grab a cup, they may move their hand outward with too much force or may move it too far, with the result of knocking over the cup instead of grabbing it. Dysdiadochokinesia refers to the inability of cerebellar patients to perform rapidly alternating movements, such as rapidly pronating and supinating the hands and forearms ."
"This diagnostic sign results from the lack of the cerebellum’s ability to coordinate the timing of muscle groups, alternately contracting and inhibiting antagonistic muscles, to produce the rhythmic movements. Scanning speech refers to the often staccato nature of speech of cerebellar patients. The production of speech is a motor act, as muscles of the jaw, tongue, and larynx need to work in unison to produce words and sounds."
"Cerebellar patients have difficulty in coordinating these muscle groups appropriately, and therefore their speech tends to be slow and disjointed. Hypotonia is another symptom of cerebellar damage. There is a decreased, pendulous myotatic reflex, as the decreased muscle resistance tends to cause the limb to swing back and forth after the initial reflex contraction."
"Intention tremor refers to the increasingly oscillatory trajectory of a cerebellar patient’s limb in a target-directed movement . For example, the hand will start out on a straight path toward the target, but as it gets closer, the hand begins to move back and forth, and the patient must slow down the movement and very carefully approach the target. Note that this tremor contrasts with the resting tremor of Parkinson’s disease, which disappears when the movement is made."
"Intention tremor is absent when the hand is still, but appears toward the end of a target-directed movement. Nystagmus is an oscillatory movement of the eyes, resulting from damage to the vestibulocerebellum. Recall that one function of the cerebellum is to fine-tune the gain of the vestibuloocular response."
"Damage to the cerebellum can disrupt this circuitry, resulting in a continuing oscillation of the eyes. Delay in initiating movements. Cerebellar patients take longer to initiate movements, often because they must actively plan sequences of movements that are performed effortlessly by normal individuals."
"In addition to movement disorders, cerebellar patients also demonstrate subtle cognitive deficits, such as an impaired ability to estimate time intervals. The simplicity of the motor systems involved in controlling eye musculature make them ideal for illustrating the mechanisms and principals you have been studying in the preceding material on motor systems. They involve the action of few muscles and of well defined neural circuits."
"We use our eyes to monitor our external environment and depend on our ocular motor systems to protect and guide our eyes. The ocular motor systems control eye lid closure, the amount of light that enters the eye, the refractive properties of the eye, and eye movements. The visual system provides afferent input to ocular motor circuits that use visual stimuli to initiate and guide the motor responses."
"Neuromuscular systems control the muscles within the eye ; the muscles attached to the eye  and the muscles in the eyelid. Ocular motor responses include ocular reflexes and voluntary motor responses to visual and other stimuli. The complexity of the circuitry  controlling a ocular motor response increases with the level of processing involved in initiating, monitoring, and guiding the response."
"In this chapter we will start at the level of reflex responses and move onto more complex voluntary responses in the following lecture. The eye blink reflex is the simplest response and does not require the involvement of cortical structures. In contrast, voluntary eye movements  involve multiple areas of the cerebral cortex as well as basal ganglion, brain stem and cerebellar structures."
"The ocular reflexes are the simplest ocular motor responses. Ocular reflexes compensate for the condition of the cornea and for changes in the visual stimulus. For example, the eye blink reflex protects the cornea from drying out and from contact with foreign objects."
"The pupillary light reflex compensates for changes in illumination level, whereas the accommodation responses compensate for changes in eye-to-object-viewed distance. Note that reflex responses are initiated by sensory stimuli that activate afferent neurons . In general, ocular reflexes are consensual ."
"Consequently, a light directed in one eye elicits responses, pupillary constriction, in both eyes. In this chapter you will learn of the structures normally involved in performing these ocular responses and the disorders that result from damage to components of neural circuit controlling these responses. Tactile stimulation of the cornea results in an irritating sensation that normally evokes eyelid closure ."
The response is consensual  - involving automatic eyelid closure at both eyes. The pupillary light reflex involves adjustments in pupil size with changes in light levels. The reflex is consensual: Normally light that is directed in one eye produces pupil constriction in both eyes.
The direct response is the change in pupil size in the eye to which the light is directed . The consensual response is the change in pupil size in the eye opposite to the eye to which the light is directed . The pupillary light reflex allows the eye to adjust the amount of light reaching the retina and protects the photoreceptors from bright lights.
"The iris contains two sets of smooth muscles that control the size of the pupil . The sphincter muscle fibers form a ring at the pupil margin so that when the sphincter contracts, it decreases  pupil size. The dilator muscle fibers radiate from the pupil aperture so that when the dilator contracts, it increases  pupil size."
"Both muscles act to control the amount of light entering the eye and the depth of field of the eye1. The iris sphincter is controlled by the parasympathetic system, whereas the iris dilator is controlled by the sympathetic system. The action of the dilator is antagonistic to that of the sphincter and the dilator must relax to allow the sphincter to decrease pupil size."
"Normally the sphincter action dominates during the pupillary light reflex. Recall that the optic tract carries visual information from both eyes and the pretectal area projects bilaterally to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei: Consequently, the normal pupillary response to light is consensual. That is, a light directed in one eye results in constriction of the pupils of both eyes."
The pupils normally dilate  when it is dark . This response involves the relaxation of the iris sphincter and contraction of the iris dilator. The iris dilator is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.
"The pupillary dark reflex neural circuit: The pathway controlling pupil dilation involves the  retina and the optic tract fibers terminating on neurons in the hypothalamus and the axons of the hypothalamic neurons that descend to the spinal cord to end on the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the lateral horn of spinal cord segments T1 to T3, which send their axons out the spinal cord to end on the sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion, which send their sympathetic postganglionic axons in the long ciliary nerve to the iris dilator. Axons from the superior cervical ganglion also innervate the face vasculature, sweat and lachrymal glands and the eyelid tarsal muscles. When the superior cervical ganglion or its axons are damaged, a constellation of symptoms, known as Horner's syndrome, result."
"This syndrome is characterized by miosis , anhidrosis , pseudoptosis , enopthalmosis  and flushing of the face. The accommodation response is elicited when the viewer directs his eyes from a distant  object to a nearby object . The stimulus is an “out-of-focus” image."
"The accommodation  response is consensual . The accommodation response involves three actions:  Pupil accommodation: The action of the iris sphincter was covered in the section on the pupillary light reflex. During accommodation, pupil constriction utilizes the ""pin-hole"" effect and increases the depth of focus of the eye by blocking the light scattered by the periphery of the cornea ."
"The iris sphincter is innervated by the postganglionic parasympathetic axons  of the ciliary ganglion . Lens accommodation: Lens accommodation increases the curvature of the lens, which increases its refractive  power. The ciliary muscles are responsible for the lens accommodation response."
"They control the tension on the zonules, which are attached to the elastic lens capsule at one end and anchored to the ciliary body at the other end . Convergence in accommodation: When shifting one's view from a distant object to a nearby object, the eyes converge  to keep the object's image focused on the foveae of the two eyes. This action involves the contraction of the medial rectus muscles of the two eyes and relaxation of the lateral rectus muscles."
The medial rectus attaches to the medial aspect of the eye and its contraction directs the eye nasally . The medial rectus is innervated by motor neurons in the oculomotor nucleus and nerve. The accommodation neural circuit: The circuitry of the accommodation response is more complex than that of the pupillary light reflex .
"The afferent limb of the circuit includes the  retina , lateral geniculate body , and visual cortex. Ocular motor control neurons are interposed between the afferent and efferent limbs of this circuit and include the  visual association cortex, which determines the image is ""out-of-focus"" sends corrective signals via the internal capsule and crus cerebri to the supraoculomotor nuclei, which is located immediately superior to the oculomotor nuclei generates motor control signals that initiate the accommodation response sends these control signals bilaterally to the oculomotor complex. The efferent limb of this system has two components: the  Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which sends its axons in the oculomotor nerve to control the ciliary ganglion, which sends it axons in the short ciliary nerve to control the iris sphincter and the ciliary muscle/zonules/lens of the eye oculomotor neurons, which sends its axons in the oculomotor nerve to control the medial rectus converge the two eyes."
An excellent way to test your knowledge of the material presented thus far is by examining the effects of damage to structures within the ocular motor pathways. The observed motor loss provide clues to the pathway affected; and the muscle and eye affected provide clues to the level of the damage. Cranial nerve damage: Damage to cranial nerves may result in sensory and motor symptoms.
"The sensory losses would involve those sensations the cranial nerve normally conveys . The motor losses may be severe  if the cranial nerve contains all of the motor axons controlling the muscles of the normally innervated area. The cranial nerves involved in the eye blink response and pupillary response are the optic, oculomotor, trigeminal and facial nerves."
"The optic nerve carries visual information from the eye. The oculomotor nerve contains lower motor axons innervating extraocular muscles: the medial, superior and inferior rectus muscles, the inferior oblique muscle, eyelid muscle: the superior levator palpebrae, as well as parasympathetic preganglionic axons to the ciliary ganglion. The trigeminal nerve contains the 1° somatosensory afferents for the face, dura, oral and nasal cavities the lower motor axons for the jaw muscles."
"The facial nerve contains the lower motor neurons innervating the superficial muscles of the face, the 1° gustatory afferents to the anterior tongue the parasympathetic preganglionic axons to parasympathetic ganglia for the lachrymal and salivary glands. Symptoms. The patient, who appears with a bloodshot left eye, complains of an inability to close his left eye."
"When asked to rise his eyebrows, he can only elevate the right eyebrow. When asked to close both eyes, the right eyelid closes but the left eyelid is only partially closed. Touching the right or left cornea with a wisp of cotton elicits the eye blink reflex in the right eye, but not the left eye ."
"However, the patient reports he can feel the cotton when it touches either eye. He can smile, whistle and show his teeth, which indicates his lower facial muscles are functioning normally. Physical examination determines that touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal over the entire the body and face."
"There are no other motor symptoms. When lower motor neurons are damaged, there is a flaccid paralysis of the muscle normally innervated. The action of the muscle will be weakened or lost depending on the extent of the damage."
There will be a weakened or no reflex response and the muscle will be flaccid and may atrophy with time. The Facial Nerve. Section of the facial nerve on one side will result in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression on the ipsilesional side of the face.
There will be an inability to close the denervated eyelid voluntarily and reflexively. The eyelids may have some mobility if the oculomotor innervation to the levator is unaffected. Symptoms.
"The patient complains of a badly infected left eye. When he is asked to close both eyes, both eyelids close. Touching the right cornea with a wisp of cotton elicits the eye blink reflex in the both eyes ."
"However, touching the left cornea with a wisp of cotton does not elicit the eye blink reflex in the either eye . The patient cannot detect pinpricks to his left forehead. However, he reports that pinpricks to rest of his face are painful."
"He can blink, wrinkle his brows, smile, and whistle and show his teeth, which indicates his facial muscles are functioning normally. Physical examination determines that touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal over the entire the body and over the lower left and right side of his face. The Trigeminal Nerve."
"Section of the trigeminal nerve will eliminate somatosensory sensation from the face and the eye blink reflex . However, light touch of the right cornea will elicit a bilateral eye blink. The effect of sectioning the trigeminal nerve is to remove the afferent input for the eye blink reflex."
Symptoms. The patient complains of pain in her left eye. Her left pupil appears dilated and is not reactive to light directed at either the left or right eye .
"The right pupil appears normal in size and reacts to light when it is directed in the right or left eye. Both eyelids can be elevated and lowered and both eyes exhibit normal movement. Touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal over the entire the body and face."
There are no other motor symptoms. Parasympathetic Innervation of the Eye. Section of the parasympathetic preganglionic  or postganglionic  innervation to one eye will result in a loss  of both the direct and consensual pupillary light responses of the denervated eye.
"Section of the left short ciliary nerve or a benign lesion in the left ciliary ganglion will result in no direct response to light in the left eye and no consensual response in the left eye when light is directed on the right eye . When the damage is limited to the ciliary ganglion or the short ciliary nerve, eyelid and ocular mobility are unaffected. Symptoms."
"The patient presents with a left eye characterized by ptosis, lateral strabismus, and dilated pupil. When asked to rise his eyelids, he can only raise the lid of the right eye. When asked to close both eyes, both eyelids close fully."
"His left pupil does not react to light directly or consensually . When asked to look to his right, his left eye moves to a central position, but no further. The right eye is fully mobile."
"When the patient is asked to look straight ahead, you note his left eye remains directed to the left and depressed. Physical examination determines that touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal over the entire the body and face. There are no other motor symptoms."
"The Oculomotor Nerve. Section of the oculomotor nerve produces a non-reactive pupil in the ipsilesional side as well as other symptoms related to oculomotor nerve damage . Section of the oculomotor nerve on one side will result in paralysis of the superior levator palpebrae, which normally elevates the eyelid."
"It will also paralyze the medial, superior & inferior rectus muscles and the inferior oblique, which will allow the lateral rectus to deviate the eye laterally and the superior oblique to depress the eye. The parasympathetic preganglionic axons of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which normally travel in the oculomotor nerve, will be cut off from the ciliary ganglion, disrupting the circuit normally used to control the iris sphincter response to light. Symptoms."
"The patient complains of reduced vision in the left eye. Pupil size in both eyes appears normal. However, both pupils do not appear to constrict as rapidly and strongly when light is directed into his left eye ."
"That is, compared to the response to light in the left eye, light in the right eye produces a more rapid constriction and smaller pupil in both eyes. Physical examination determines that touch, vibration, position and pain sensations are normal over the entire the body and over the lower left and right side of his face. The Optic Nerve."
Partial damage of the retina or optic nerve reduces the afferent component of the pupillary reflex circuit. The reduced afferent input to the pretectal areas is reflected in weakened direct and consensual pupillary reflex responses in both eyes . Section of one optic nerve will result in the complete loss of the direct pupillary light reflex but not the consensual reflex of the blinded eye.
"That is, if the left optic nerve is sectioned, light directed on the left  eye will not elicit a pupillary response in the left eye  or the right eye . However, light directed in the right eye will elicit pupillary responses in the right eye and the left  eye. The effect of sectioning one optic nerve is to remove the afferent input for the direct reflex of the blinded eye and the afferent input for the consensual reflex of the normal eye."
"Section of one optic tract will not eliminate the direct or consensual reflex of either eye as the surviving optic tract contains optic nerve fibers from both eyes. However, the responses to light in both eyes may be weaker because of the reduced afferent input to the ipsilesional pretectal area. Symptoms."
A patient who is suffering from the late stages of syphilis is sent to you for a neuro-ophthalmological work-up. His vision is normal when corrected for refractive errors. He has normal ocular mobility and his eyelids can be elevated and depressed at will.
"Examination of his pupillary responses indicates a loss of the pupillary light reflex  but normal pupillary accommodation response . In the Argyll Robertson response, there is an absence of the pupillary light reflex with a normal pupillary accommodation response. The Argyll Robertson response is attributed to bilateral damage to pretectal areas  with sparing of the supraoculomotor area ."
"The accommodation response involves many of the structures involved in the pupillary light response and, with the exception of the pretectal area and supraoculomotor area, damage to either pathway will produce common the symptoms. The most common complaint involving the accommodation response is its loss with aging . Recall that presbyopia most commonly results from structural changes in the lens which impedes the lens accommodation response."
"This chapter described three types of ocular motor responses  and reviewed the nature of the responses and the effectors, efferent neurons, higher-order motor control neurons , and afferent neurons normally involved in performing these ocular responses. Table I summarizes these structures and the function of these ocular motor responses. Readers should understand the anatomical basis for disorders that result from damage to components of neural circuit controlling these responses."
"Normal visual perception requires the proper functioning of ocular motor systems that control the position and movement of the eyes to focus the image of the object-of-interest  on corresponding areas of the retinas of the two eyes. For example, in addition to producing adjustments in pupil size and lens refraction, accommodation involves the convergence of the two eyes to direct onto the foveae the images of near objects. Eye movements are also controlled to direct the eyes towards a visual target and to follow the movements of the visual target."
"Such eye movements are controlled by gaze systems. They coordinate the movement of the two eyes to ensure that the images on the two retinas fall on corresponding areas of the binocular field. When this fails, diplopia  results."
The extraocular muscles execute eye movements and are innervated by three cranial nerves. The muscles are attached to the sclera of the eye at one end and are anchored to the bony orbit of the eye at their opposite ends. Contraction of the muscles produce movement of the eyes within the orbit.
The cranial lower motor neurons innervate these muscles and thereby control their contractions. The extraocular muscles of the right eye and their actions. Antagonistic actions pull the eye in opposite directions whereas synergistic actions pull the eye in the same direction.
"For each eye, six muscles work together to control eye position and movement. Two extraocular muscles, the medial rectus and lateral rectus, work together to control horizontal eye movements . Contraction of the medial rectus pulls the eye towards the nose ."
Contraction of the lateral rectus pulls the eye away from the nose . The actions of these two muscles are antagonistic: one muscle must relax while the other contracts to execute horizontal eye movements. Four other extraocular muscles working together control vertical eye movements and eye rotation around the mid-orbital axis .
"To direct the eye upward or downward, two muscles contract synergistically as the two antagonist muscles relax. For example, to elevate the eye while looking straight ahead, the superior rectus and inferior oblique contract together as the inferior rectus and superior oblique relax. The superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles working together pull the eye upward without rotating the eye."
"To depress the eye while looking straight ahead, the inferior rectus and superior oblique contract together as the superior rectus and inferior oblique relax. The inferior rectus and superior oblique working together pull the eye downward without rotating the eye. Three cranial motor nuclei provide efferent control of the extraocular muscles."
Activation of the motor neurons produces contraction of the innervated muscle. The abducens nucleus sends its axons in the abducens  nerve controls the lateral rectus of the ipsilateral eye. The trochlear nucleus sends its axons in the trochlear  nerve controls the superior oblique of the contralateral eye.
"The oculomotor complex contains nuclei that send axons in the oculomotor  nerve control the superior levator in the eyelid of both eyes extraocular muscles, which include the medial rectus of the ipsilateral eye, inferior oblique of the ipsilateral eye inferior rectus of the ipsilateral eye superior rectus of the contralateral eye1. The motor neurons controlling synergist and antagonist muscles must coordinate their activities to produce the desired eye movements. Within the abducens nucleus are abducens interneurons, which send their axons into the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus ."
"They ascend in the MLF to end on oculomotor neurons controlling the medial rectus . The abducens interneurons coordinate the activity of the ipsilateral lateral rectus with that of the contralateral medial rectus. For example, excitation of the motor neurons in the left abducens nucleus will result in contraction of the left lateral rectus and abduction of the left eye ."
"Excitation of the interneurons in the left abducens nucleus will excite neurons in the right oculomotor nucleus that innervate the right medial rectus. Contraction of the right medial results in adduction of the right eye . Consequently, both the right and left eyes will be directed towards the left when the left abducens nucleus is excited."
Interconnections between the trochlear nucleus and oculomotor nuclear complex coordinate their activity to allow the upward and downward movement of the eyes. These interconnecting axons appear to travel along with the fibers of the tectospinal tract . There are two functional classes of eye movements : those that stabilize the eye when the head moves or appears to move  and those that keep the image of a visual target focused on the fovea  when the visual target changes or moves .
Two gaze stabilization systems operate during head movement: the vestibulo-ocular and the optokinetic systems. Vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic movements are conjugate movements in which both eyes move in the same direction. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes produce eye movements that compensate for head movements detected by the vestibular system.
You have learned in earlier chapters how the vestibular system detects head movements and initiates the vestibulo-ocular responses. Notice that optokinetic nystagmus is a visual-ocular response - driven by visual stimuli moving across the visual field. Vestibular nystagmus is a vestibulo-ocular response - driven by a vestibular stimulus .
"In humans, the smooth pursuit system predominates in producing eye movements that track moving visual targets. As the optokinetic system is vestigial in humans, it will not be covered in this lecture. Three gaze shifting systems function during foveation: smooth pursuit, which directs the eyes to follow a moving visual target; saccade, which directs the eyes toward a visual target; and vergence, which alters the angle between the two eyes to adjust for changes in distance from the visual target."
"We have covered the neural control of convergence during accommodation in the previous lecture. Voluntary or guided saccades are eye movements initiated to bring an object-of-interest into view or initiated under direction . Saccades consist of short, rapid, jerky  movements of predetermined trajectory that direct the eyes toward some visual target."
The neurons in the frontal eye field   are involved in initiating voluntary saccades that locate and focus on a particular object-of-interest. are located posteriorly in the middle frontal gyrus. compute the direction and amplitude of the saccade.
"send their axons in the internal capsule, crus cerebri and corticotectal tract to the midbrain where they decussate and end in the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus can initiate and control saccades independent of input from the frontal eye field. However, the motor control signals initiated by the frontal eye field and the superior colliculus differ in function."
"However, when the frontal eye field is damaged, the superior colliculus will compensate for the loss following a short period of dysfunction. For example, damage to the right frontal eye field produces a transient inability to look voluntarily to the left side. Normally the frontal eye field initiates voluntary and memory-guided saccades, whereas the superior colliculus initiates reflex orienting saccades."
"Because voluntary saccades are not, in general, initiated by visual stimuli, afferent visual control occurs only after the fact. That is, the visual system  is used to determine whether the saccade was successful in bringing the desired object into view. Consequently, the saccades consists of a series of short, fast eye movement, followed by a check by the visual system as to whether the desired visual target is in view, which may be followed by another series of brief eye movements to locate the visual target."
"The repeated sequence of brief, rapid eye movements and image check until the visual target is in view characterizes saccades. Smooth pursuit  is an eye movement elicited by a moving visual target that the eyes follow voluntarily or under direction . Pursuit movements are described to be voluntary, smooth, continuous, conjugate eye movements with velocity and trajectory determined by the moving visual target."
"By tracking the movement of the visual target, the eyes maintain a focused image of the target on the fovea. Notice that a visual stimulus  is required to initiate this eye movement. Temporal eye field neurons in the non-human primate  compute the direction and velocity of the moving visual target."
"8 correspond to neurons in superior temporal-inferior parietal areas in humans. That is, damage to the temporal-parietal areas in humans produce symptoms similar to those produced by damage to MT and MST in non-human primates. send their axons to the dorsolateral pontine nucleus ."
"Consequently, the vestibular nuclei help coordinate the activities of antagonist muscles involved in eye movements during smooth pursuit and vestibule-ocular reflexes. 10  Note that there are two decussations  involved in the horizontal smooth pursuit pathway . Consequently, the command signals generated by the MST and MT cortical neurons result in an execution of smooth pursuit eye movement in a direction ipsilateral to these cortical neurons."
"Normally, a command generated by the left MST and MT cortical neurons results in both eyes tracking the movement of an object moving to the left. Damage to the lower motor neurons that innervate an extraocular muscle results in a flaccid paralysis of the muscle, whereas damage to upper motor neurons produce deficits only in selective types of movements . Damage to an extraocular muscle’s motor neurons results in a paralysis of the muscle that is often manifested as a strabismus ."
"At rest , the denervated eye is deviated from its normal position by the unopposed action of the muscle that is its antagonist. The strabismus may result in double vision  because the image falling on the retina of each eye will be from non-corresponding areas in the binocular visual fields. When the patient closes one eye, the double image is replaced by a single image."
"Damage to the oculomotor nerve. As we have already covered this topic in the previous lecture, a brief summary of the effect of oculomotor nerve lesion on eye movements will be presented. All of the extraocular muscles, except the lateral rectus and superior oblique, will be denervated and paralyzed and the patient will be unable to elevate or adduct the eye ipsilateral to the oculomotor nerve damaged."
"The innervation of the superior palpebrae muscle and the ciliary ganglion  will also be lost. Consequently, there will be ptosis, dilated pupil and lateral strabismus in the denervated eye. If the left oculomotor nerve is damaged,  at rest, the eye is deviated down and laterally  - a lateral strabismus - because the lateral rectus is unopposed."
"on an attempted gaze to the right, the left medial rectus will not contract to adduct the left eye . Consequently, at rest and during an attempted right lateral gaze, the lateral strabismus will result in a diplopia. On attempting to adduct the eye , the left lateral rectus relaxes and the left eye deviates to the midline, but not past it."
"Damage to the trochlear nerve. When the trochlear nerve is damaged, the symptoms are mild. The downward and lateral movement of the eye may be weakened and may cause diplopia when reading or descending stairs."
A patient may present with his head tilted because the damaged eye is extorted  and slightly elevated because of the paralysis of the superior oblique muscle. Tilting the head away from the affected eye brings the visual axis of the partially paralyzed eye into alignment with the visual axis of the normal eye. Symptoms.
A 65 year-old male presents with a medial strabismus of his left eye  and cannot move his left eye to the left . His right eye has normal motility and his pupillary reflexes are normal. His vision is normal in both eyes.
He has normal sensation on his face and body and no other motor symptoms. Electrophysiological tests indicate that the left lateral rectus is responsive . You conclude that the left abducens nerve has been damaged.
"Damage to the abducens nerve. The lateral rectus will be denervated and paralyzed and the patient will be unable to abduct the eye. For example, if the left abducens nerve is damaged, the left eye will not abduct fully ."
"While attempting to look straight ahead, the left eye will be deviated medially towards the nose  due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus of the left eye. On attempting to gaze left, the left eye may deviate to the midpoint, but not past it, because the medial rectus of the left eye is relaxed. The patient may complain of double or blurred vision  when looking towards the ipsilesional side  or when looking straight ahead."
"Damage of upper motor neurons does not result in a flaccid paralysis. However, the muscle will not be activated into the response normally controlled by the upper motor neuron . However, the muscle will perform reflex responses  and responses controlled by other intact ocular motor circuits."
Symptoms. A 65 year-old male presents with a left medial strabismus and cannot move both his eyes to the left . His vision and his pupillary reflexes are normal in both eyes.
He has normal sensation on his face and body and no other motor symptoms. Neural imaging tests indicate a small infarct  in the region of the left facial colliculus. You conclude that the damaged area includes the left abducens nucleus.
"Damage to the abducens nucleus. The result is an abnormality of conjugate horizontal eye movements called lateral gaze paralysis. With the eyes at rest, there is a medial strabismus in the eye ipsilateral to the damage ."
"During an attempted lateral gaze, both eyes cannot be moved beyond the midline in an ipsilesional direction . As the left abducens interneurons send axons to the right oculomotor neurons innervating the medial rectus of the right eye , the failure to perform a lateral gaze to the left suggests an abducens nucleus lesion. An attempted lateral gaze in a contralesional direction  is successful."
"Note that as the lower motor neurons , as well as a motor control center , are damaged, both reflex and voluntary eye movements in the horizontal plane are affected. An example of the effect of damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus is presented in the Appendix. Symptoms."
"A 65 year-old male was brought to the emergency room because he suddenly lost the ability to speak and could not move the right side of his body or face. He was described to be right handed and on antihypertensive medications. Examination revealed weakness in his right face, no movement in his right arm and weakness in his right leg with Babinski's sign."
"His speech was nonfluent. He could not move his eyes to the right when asked to ""look right"" . He was able to move his eyes in other directions."
Sensation over the body and face was decreased on the right side. His vision and hearing appeared within the normal range. Neural imaging tests indicate infarction of branches of the medial cerebral artery supplying the lateral surface of the left frontal cortex.
"Damage to the voluntary saccades circuit. Damage to the frontal cortical eye field and the midbrain  effect voluntary and reflex saccades, particularly those in the horizontal plane. Immediately following unilateral damage of the frontal cortical eye field, there is an inability to voluntarily initiate a horizontal eye movement in a direction contralateral to  the side of the lesion."
"That is, immediately following a right frontal lobe lesion, both eyes cannot be moved voluntarily to the left beyond the midline. However, both eyes will move to the left beyond the midline to vestibular stimulation. Both eyes can also be directed to the side ipsilateral to the lesion and may tend to deviate toward the lesion when the eyes are at rest."
The deficits disappear with time if the damage is localized to the frontal cortical eye field and does not involve the superior colliculus. Symptoms. A 55 year-old male was brought to the emergency room.
"He was overweight and reportedly normally right-handed, a heavy smoker and drinker. He had lost consciousness during a game of basketball and when he awoke, appeared confused. When examined in the ER, he was conscious but followed no commands and could not repeat."
"He could mimic gestures and was able to voluntarily look to the left and right . His eyes followed a pen moving to his right with a smooth pursuit movement. However, his eye movements became jerky and ballistic at midpoint in the attempt to follow the pen as it moved to his left."
Neural imaging tests indicate infarction of branches of the left medial cerebral artery supplying the caudal superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus. Damage to the smooth pursuit circuit: Damage to the temporal eye field causes deficits in the ability to fixate on objects and to track them. Attempts to fixate on a target will be undermined by severe instability and wandering of the eyes.
"Tracking movements are jerky rather than smooth when attempting to follow an object moving in a direction toward  the side of the lesion. Note that the smooth pursuit circuit includes a double crossing and the temporal eye field controls ipsilateral eye movements . When the temporal eye field is damaged, the two eyes may follow a visual target in an ipsilesional direction; but does so using the voluntary saccades circuit."
"That is, if the frontal cortical eye fields are intact, the eyes may be moved voluntarily  toward an object of interest ipsilateral to the impairment. However, in this case, the movements will be jerky unlike the eye movements in smooth pursuit. Tracking of visual targets contralateral to the lesion will be smooth."
"This chapter reviews the ways in which voluntary eye movements are initiated by cerebral cortical activity and involve more ocular motor control structures than the simple ocular reflexes. The cortical areas initiate eye movements and work through brainstem ocular motor centers to produce a response, i. e."
", there are no direct connections between the cerebral cortex and the extraocular motor nuclei. The smooth pursuit system utilizes a pontine nucleus, the cerebellum, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex pathway to execute eye movements to tract visual targets. The voluntary saccades system is similar to other voluntary motor systems in engaging areas in the frontal cortex to initiate the response and in influencing the motor neurons indirectly through lower motor control structures ."
"The gaze centers function to coordinate and control the activity of motor neurons to insure that the extraocular muscles act synergistically to produce conjugate saccades. Homeostasis is the process by which a steady state of equilibrium, or constancy, in the body with respect to physiological functions and chemical compositions of fluids and tissues is maintained. Physiological set points refer to the baseline level at which functions such as heart rate, and at which chemical compositions such as plasma sodium concentration are normally maintained."
"These set points are represented in the brain by specific discharge rates in neurons dedicated to the monitoring and control of specific physiological processes. Thus, separate groups of neurons are dedicated to the control of heart rate, temperature, etc. , by their set point discharge rate."
"The hypothalamus has the greatest concentration of nuclei at which set points are encoded, monitored and controlled, and so can be considered as the key brain region for the control of homeostasis. Specific receptors and sensors throughout the body detect disruptions in the normal balance of body functions and chemistry that are produced by stress stimuli that can range from injury or infection to pain and emotional distress. These data are transmitted to the central nervous system and affect the discharge rate of set point neurons in hypothalamic nuclei ."
"These changes in discharge rate result in altered hypothalamic efferent outflow and hence change in the functions of regulatory systems that counteract the stress stimulus and restore homeostasis. These effects include alterations in the functions of the autonomic nervous system, endocrine and immune systems, as well as alterations in behavior by hypothalamic influences on limbic brain circuitry. Each of the target systems influenced by the hypothalamus return feedback controls onto the hypothalamus completing a circuit and so establishing a homeostasis system."
The role of the hypothalamus in regulation of homeostasis is essential for survival and reproduction of the species. The importance of this function is underscored by the structural organization and connectivity of the hypothalamus as almost every major subdivision of the neuraxis communicates with the hypothalamus and is subject to its influence. Landmarks that are visible on the ventral and medial  surfaces of the brain define the boundaries of the hypothalamus.
The rostral boundary visible on the ventral surface of the brain is formed by the optic chiasm while the mammillary bodies define the posterior boundary. Between these structures the oval prominence from the floor of the third ventricle is the tuber cinereum and evaginating from this is the median eminence which then tapers into the infundibular stalk which together form the inferior boundary of the hypothalamus. On the medial  surface of the brain other structures contributing to the rostral boundary that are visible include the lamina terminalis and the anterior commisure.
"Also visible on the medial surface of the brain is the hypothalamic sulcus, which is the rostral continuation of the sulcus limitans that defines the superior boundary of the hypothalamus. Finally, the internal capsule that is only visible on coronal or horizontal sections of the brain forms the lateral boundary. The hypothalamus is composed of three longitudinally oriented cell columns, or zones, that run the entire rostrocaudal length of the hypothalamus ."
"These zones can be further subdivided into four nuclear groups, or regions, based on rostrocaudal position. Zones. Immediately bordering the third ventricle, just inside of the ependymal cell lining, is a thin layer of cells that comprise the periventricular zone."
"This zone contains few distinct nuclei, but two that are very prominent are the arcuate nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus, which are involved in neuroendocrine and autonomic regulation. Immediately adjacent to the periventricular zone is the medial zone, which is comprised of several cytoarchitectonically distinct nuclei that are listed below. Nuclei in the medial zone are especially involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system as well as involved in regulation of the neuroendocrine system."
"Finally, the lateral zone, has few nuclei or clear landmarks, but contains important fiber pathways such as the median forebrain bundle. Demarcated by the fornix, the lateral zone is involved in regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Regions."
"Each of the zones described above are further subdivided into regions based on rostrocaudal landmarks . The anterior region runs from the lamina terminalis to the caudal aspect of the optic chiasm. The portion of the anterior region that is rostral to the optic chiasm is often also referred to as the preoptic region, however this distinction is now less emphasized."
"The next region that is identified when proceeding caudally is the tuberal region. The margins of this region include the areas that are above and including the tuber cinereum. Finally, the posterior region is defined by the area above and including the mammillary bodies."
Nuclei. There are eleven major nuclei in the hypothalamus . The functions of many of these will be covered in further detail in later sections.
"However, a brief note on the organization of these can be useful. The nuclei can be grouped based on their locations in the hypothalamic zones and regions. Starting medially, the paraventricular nucleus is located in the periventricular zone and runs rostrocaudally through the anterior into the tuberal region."
"The arcuate nucleus also has a portion located in the periventricular zone though it also extends laterally into the medial zone. This nucleus sits in the floor of the tuberal region of the hypothalamus. Both of these nuclei, along with the supraoptic nucleus, located just above the optic chiasm in the anterior region of the medial zone extending laterally into the lateral zone, have key roles in neuroendocrine regulation."
"The paraventricular nucleus also has an important role in regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Additional nuclei found in the anterior region of the medial zone include the suprachiasmatic nucleus involved in circadian timing, the anterior nucleus involved in control of the autonomic nervous system, and the preoptic nucleus which also extends into the lateral zone and involved in control of the autonomic nervous system. Additional nuclei in the tuberal region of the medial zone include the dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei, which are involved in control of behavior and of appetite, body weight and insulin secretion, respectively."
"Nuclei of the posterior region of the medial zone include the posterior nucleus, which is another autonomic nervous system control center, and the mammillary nuclei, which are involved in control of emotional expression and memory. Finally, the lateral tuberal complex in the tuberal region of the lateral zone is involved in control of appetite. The hypothalamus has the most complex circuitry of any brain region."
"Like other brain areas there are neural interconnections. But unlike other brain areas, there are also extensive non-neural communication pathways between the hypothalamus and other brain regions and the periphery. Neural Connections."
"The most noteworthy  feature of the neural connections of the hypothalamus is that except for a few exceptions, they are extensively bi-directional. Limbic Circuits. These pathways are essential for the normal expression and control of emotions, learning and reproductive behavior."
"The bi-directional  pathways include the medial forebrain bundle, the fornix, the stria terminalis and the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. The medial forebrain bundle interconnects basal forebrain structures including the septal nuclei and ventral striatum with hypothalamus and structures in the brainstem tegmentum including the locus ceruleus, the parabrachial nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The fornix interconnects the hippocampal formation to the septal, preoptic and medial mammillary nuclei."
"The stria terminalis interconnects the amygdala to the septal region and the hypothalamus especially, the preoptic and ventromedial regions. Finally, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway interconnects the amygdala, especially the central amygdaloid nucleus with the septal region and the preoptic areas of the hypothalamus. In addition to these bi-directional pathways, there are also two unidirectional efferent limbic pathways from the hypothalamus."
"The mammillothalamic tract projects from the mammillary nuclei to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus in turn projects to the cingulate cortex, which completes the circuit of Papez by projecting back onto the subiculum of the hippocampus. The circuit of Papez was the first circuit proposed to mediate emotions and still is considered one of the chief circuits of the limbic system."
The mammillotegmental tract projects from the mammillary nuclei to the brainstem tegmentum and as far caudal as the lateral gray of the spinal cord. Sensory and Autonomic Circuits. These pathways provide visceral and somatosensory input to the hypothalamus and output of the hypothalamus to control the autonomic nervous system.
"These pathways are especially important for the control of feeding, insulin release and reproduction. The bi-directional pathways in this circuitry include the medial forebrain bundle noted as part of limbic circuitry above, as well as the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus. Whereas the medial forebrain bundle runs laterally through the brainstem and hypothalamus, the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus runs medially through the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter."
"Both pathways bring visceral and somatic input to the hypothalamus from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the parabrachial nuclei, the reticular formation and the periaqueductal gray. The medial forebrain bundle also brings monoaminergic fibers containing noradrenaline and serotonin into the hypothalamus from various brainstem nuclei including the raphe nuclei that have key roles in modulating neuroendocrine functions. More rostral projections of these monoaminergic fibers as well as peptide-containing efferent fibers that originate in the hypothalamus and join the medial forebrain bundle as it ascends into the orbital cortex, insula and frontal cortex are involved in the control of motivation."
Descending efferent projections of the hypothalamus through these pathways terminate on parasympathetic nuclei of the brainstem such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Unidirectional afferent input to the hypothalamus is derived from the spinohypothalamic tract and the retino-hypothalamic tract. The spinohypothalamic tract is a component of the anterolateral system of somatosensory fibers that also includes the spinothalamic tract and provides input concerning pain as well as input necessary for orgasm.
"The retino-hypothalamic tract provides input to the suprachiasmatic nucleus that is used to entrain circadian rhythms to the light-dark cycle. Finally, unidirectional efferent pathways from the hypothalamus include the hypothalamo-spinal tract, which projects onto brainstem and finally spinal preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons in the spinal intermediolateral cell column, and a histamine projection to thalamus and cortex from the inferior lateral tuberal region that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Neuro-Humoral Connections."
Unlike any other brain structure the hypothalamus both sends and receives information by way of the blood stream. There are two pathways that comprise the neuro-humoral connections of the hypothalamus. The Pituitary.
"These pathways include the hypophyseal-portal system of blood vessels that surround the median eminence, the infundibulum and pituitary gland. The details of this system in neuroendocrine function will comprise the third chapter of this section. Sensory and Autonomic Circuits."
"These pathways provide visceral and somatosensory input to the hypothalamus and output of the hypothalamus to control the autonomic nervous system. These pathways are especially important for the control of feeding, insulin release and reproduction. The bi-directional pathways in this circuitry include the medial forebrain bundle noted as part of limbic circuitry above, as well as the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus."

The retino-hypothalamic tract provides input to the suprachiasmatic nucleus that is used to entrain circadian rhythms to the light-dark cycle. Finally, unidirectional efferent pathways from the hypothalamus include the hypothalamo-spinal tract, which projects onto brainstem and finally spinal preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons in the spinal intermediolateral cell column, and a histamine projection to thalamus and cortex from the inferior lateral tuberal region that regulates the sleep-wake cycle."
Neuro-Humoral Connections. Unlike any other brain structure the hypothalamus both sends and receives information by way of the blood stream. There are two pathways that comprise the neuro-humoral connections of the hypothalamus.
"The Pituitary. These pathways include the hypophyseal-portal system of blood vessels that surround the median eminence, the infundibulum and pituitary gland. The details of this system in neuroendocrine function will comprise the third chapter of this section."
It has been highlighted several times in this section that the overarching function of the hypothalamus is the integration of body functions for the maintenance of homeostasis. The multiplicity of functions that are entailed in this level of integration should be intuitively obvious. The table below lists many of these functions and the nuclear groups that are most closely associated their execution.
"Thermoregulation, Neuroendocrine control, Feeding and Satiety. The details concerning thermoregulation, neuroendocrine function, and control of feeding will be the subject of later chapters. Biological Timing and Rhythms."
"Circadian timing refers to the daily fluctuations that occur in hormone levels, body temperature, sleep-wake cycle, etc. ; while circannual timing refers to fluctuations in function that occur on a yearly cycle. The chief hypothalamic nucleus involved in this process is the suprachiasmatic nucleus , which can be considered as the body’s master clock."
"The neurons in the SCN have an intrinsic rhythm of discharge activity that will re-cycle in the absence of light at 25 hour intervals. This activity is an intrinsic property of SCN neurons that can be maintained for days while the cells are maintained in culture. Input to the SCN from the retinohypothalamic tract resets and entrains the activity of SCN neurons to the daily 24 hour light-dark cycle by regulating the transcription of the light-sensitive clock, bmal, period  and cryptochrome  genes."
"The retino-hypothalamic tract is a non-rod, non-cone dependent input to the SCN from a subset of retinal ganglion cells that are directly activated by light interacting with the pigment melanopsin. The SCN has projections into multiple hypothalamic nuclei that control the specific functions that show daily or annual rhythms. Thus, the SCN is considered as a master pacemaker that regulates the functions of multiple intra- and extra-hypothalamic slave oscillators."
"One extraordinary example of an extra-hypothalamic slave oscillator is the induction of fetal circadian timing from the mother. A specific, and perhaps more concrete example of this circuitry is illustrated by the regulation of melatonin secretion. Activation of the SCN by light results in increased input to the paraventricular nucleus, which in turn activates sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in the T1-T2 spinal intermediolateral cell column."
"These neurons inhibit the superior cervical ganglion which sends noradrenergic innervation into the pineal gland that inhibits the release of melatonin. With the onset of darkness, this inhibition is removed, and so melatonin secretion increases through a disinhibition process . There are two major classes of disorders in circadian timing, phase shifting and entrainment failure, both of which manifest themselves as sleep disorders."
"The most common phase shift disorder is the rapid time-zone change syndrome, or jet lag, characterized by daytime sleepiness and nighttime insomnia. The molecular biology of this disorder is becoming well-defined. Circadian disruption is more sensitive to advances in local time than to delays."
"Circadian expression of mPer in SCN reacts rapidly to an advance in light onset whereas expression of mCry advances slowly, at a maximum rate of 3hours/cycle. It is only when the expression of both genes resume their baseline parallel expression that the behavioral and light:dark cycles become re-aligned. In contrast, mPer and mCry expression cycles react rapidly and in parallel with a delay in light cycle, such that a complete reset is achieved within one cycle."
"A second type of phase shift disorder is delayed sleep phase syndrome commonly seen in adolescents and possibly linked to an endocrine-mediated desensitization of SCN pacemakers to phase-advancing stimuli. Finally, advanced sleep phase syndrome, characterized by onset of sleep in the early evening followed by very early pre-dawn awakening is commonly observed in the elderly and is associated with a missense mutation in mPer2. Entrainment failure is often, though not always, observed in the blind."
"It is important to remember that the retino-hypothalamic tract has nothing to do with vision and so can be preserved in the blind, and may also be absent in those with vision. It has become increasingly evident that circadian timing can have tremendous impact on the susceptibility to disease as well as conversely, to the optimal timing of curative therapy . Chronomorbidity refers to the observation that certain disorders characteristically show peak prevalence at particular times of the day, whereas Chronotherapeutics is the application of therapies at the time of day when their effects can be expected to have the greatest impact."
"The best current example of effective chronotherapeutics is that treatment of seasonal affective disorder  is successfully treated with bright light therapy only when applied during the morning hours. The hypothalamus is the key brain site for integration of multiple biologic systems to maintain homeostasis. Neurons in the hypothalamus discharge in relation to multiple physiologic indices and change discharge rate with changes in these indices, thus establishing set points."
"The three major systems controlled by the hypothalamus for maintenance of homeostasis are the autonomic nervous system, the neuroendocrine system, and the limbic system. The hypothalamus has well defined anatomical boundaries. Different regions of the hypothalamus are especially associated with the control of specific physiological subsystems."
"The broad scope of brain regions affected by the hypothalamus is reflected by a very widespread extent of connectivity of the hypothalamus to other brain areas and by unique neuro-humoral communication pathways. One key function of the hypothalamus is regulation of body functions in concert with the daily light:dark cycle. Intrinsic timing mechanisms of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controlled by the expression of the light sensitive clock, bmal, per, and cry genes establish the master pacemaker of the body."
"The activity of these cells is set in phase to light by inputs from a special subset of non-rod, non-cone dependent melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells via the retino-hypothalamic tract. The Neuroendocrine System represents the second, and last, major efferent system of the hypothalamus that we will consider in detail in this section. The third efferent system, the limbic system, will be covered in a later chapter."
"The information transfer in the hypothalamic-neuroendocrine pathways are unique in that they are largely blood borne as opposed to neurally mediated. Traditionally, the neuroendocrine system has been considered in two parts, that part dealing with the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis; and that part dealing with the anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis. However, it is increasingly clear that the immune system also has such an important effect on neuroendocrine regulation that it must now also be considered as a special “diffuse” neuroendocrine component."
"The posterior pituitary is often termed the neurohypophysis because the hormones of this part of the pituitary are released directly from the axonal endings of their source neurons into the circulation . The hypothalamic nuclei in which the cell bodies of these neurons reside are the supraoptic and the paraventricular nuclei. As we discussed in the previous chapter, both nuclei are composed of multiple cell types, but it is only the large magnocellular neurons that produce the hormones and that send axons into the neurohypophysis."
"The pathway from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary is called the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract. It is along this tract that the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin  are cleaved from their prohormones and prepared for release in vesicles along with their co-peptides neurophysin I  and neurophysin II . Although the two amino acid peptides  only differ by two amino acids, a given neuron produces only one or the other type of hormone at a time, but not both simultaneously."
Release of hormones into the circulation of the posterior pituitary occurs following various neural stimuli and so the functions of this portion of the neuroendocrine system is characterized by reflexes with neural input and hormonal output. Oxytocin. Oxytocin has no diurnal rhythm but is released in three reflexes following the influence of several different types of stimuli.
"In the milk let-down reflex  the tactile stimuli applied to the breast by the suckling infant are transmitted to the hypothalamus by the spinohypothalamic tract directly to the preoptic and paraventricular nuclei to excite the magnocellular neurons and so provoke the release of hormone into the circulation. Oxytocin travels through the bloodstream acts on the mammary glands to cause milk release so that about 13 seconds later milk enters the ducts of the gland. Other non-tactile stimuli can also provoke this reflex including the sound of the baby crying, visual cues, anxiety, and other stimuli that increase hypothalamic sympathetic tone."
"During parturition oxytocin induces powerful contractions of the uterine myometrium . Parturition itself is not induced by oxytocin, but the strength and frequency of the contractions of labor are enhanced by oxytocin. Pressure on the cervix or uterine wall are transmitted to the hypothalamus by the spinohypothalamic tract inducing hormone release as above which enters the blood acting to enhance contractions and so closing a positive feedback loop."
Once the baby is born the cervical pressure is released and contractions cease. Synthetic oxytocin  is often given to increase uterine tone and control uterine bleeding following birth and after some gynecological procedures. Oxytocin also produces contractions of the uterine myometrium and smooth muscles of the male and female reproductive tract that are important for sperm transport.
"The stimuli in this reflex are inputs from CNS sympathetic pathways activated with sexual activity. Vasopressin. Vasopressin, also known as arginine vasopressin , acts on V2 receptors on the contraluminal surface of the distal tubular epithelium primarily in the collecting duct of the kidney to increase permeability and allow reabsorption of water and electrolytes into the circulation ."
Vasopressin has a diurnal peak late at night and early in the morning and a trough in the mid-afternoon. Sensors for plasma osmolality control the evoked secretion of vasopressin by magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The magnocellular neurons have intrinsic osmoreceptors in their plasma membrane and also receive afferent inputs from osmo-sensitive neurons in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis.
"Sensors in the subfornical organ for angiotensin II also stimulate the release of vasopressin. Angiotensin II in the blood is elevated following the release of renin from the kidney in response to a decrease in blood pressure. Finally, the carotid and aortic arch bodies that signal the hypothalamus via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves via relay in the solitary nucleus also detect a decrease in blood oxygen or pressure and promote the release of vasopressin."
"Disorders of the Posterior Pituitary  Oxytocin: No disorders have been acknowledged. Diabetes Insipidus results due to insufficient vasopressin secretion in response to normal physiologic stimuli  or due to failure of the kidney to respond to vasopressin . Neoplastic or infiltrative lesions, pituitary or hypothalamic surgery, severe head injuries, and idiopathic causes in that order most frequently cause central diabetes insipidus."
"The second two may remit spontaneously due to revascularization of the hypothalamo-pituitary stalk. The symptoms include large amounts of dilute urine, dehydration and thirst. Treatment is by hormone replacement."
"Syndrome of Inappropriate AVP Secretion  is associated with some central nervous system disorders including trauma, encephalitis, cerebrovascular accident and acute psychosis. Some drugs, including vincristine, some general anesthetics and antidepressants release or potentiate the effects of vasopressin. Elevated vasopressin also occurs in some tumors following ectopic synthesis and release."
"Clinical signs include hyponatremia, edema, hypovolemic features, hyperosmolality of the urine, and hyperlipidemia. Treatment requires fluid restriction and then identification and treatment of the underlying cause. The Anterior Pituitary is an endocrine gland controlled by the hypothalamus in several fundamentally different fashions than is the posterior pituitary."
"None of the six major hormones released by the adenohypophysis are of hypothalamic origin, rather all are synthesized in cells embryonically derived from Rathke’s pouch in the anterior pituitary itself and released directly into the blood stream. Releasing- and release-inhibiting hormones that are synthesized in the arcuate, paraventricular, periventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus control anterior pituitary hormone secretion. Parvocellular neurons in these nuclei send their axons into the tuberoinfundibular tract and terminate on a capillary bed of the superior hypophyseal arteries located around the base of the median eminence."
A given parvocellular neuron may release one or more releasing factor into these capillaries that coalesce into 6 to 10 small straight veins that form the hypophyseal-portal blood circulation which descends along the infundibular stalk and forms a second capillary plexus around the anterior pituitary. The releasing-hormones gain access to the five distinct types of target cells in the anterior pituitary from this plexus and stimulate anterior pituitary hormone release back into the capillary bed that then drains into the systemic circulation and transports the hormones to peripheral target tissues. The target tissues are stimulated to produce final mediator hormones that induce the physiological changes in peripheral tissues typical of each hormone.
"Control of secretion of the releasing factors, pituitary hormones and peripheral endocrine hormones is tightly inter-related in a set of feedback loops . The ultra-short feedback loop is mediated by the hypothalamic releasing factors limiting their own release by a type of autocrine effect on targets in the hypothalamus. Inhibition of releasing-factor secretion by pituitary hormones comprises short loop feedback."
"Finally, peripheral hormone inhibition of pituitary secretion comprises the direct long-loop feedback and inhibition on hypothalamic secretion of the releasing factors comprises the indirect long-loop feedback. Growth hormone  is secreted from somatotrophs, which comprise about half of the cells in the anterior pituitary . GH release is characteristically pulsatile being very low most of the day except following meals, exercise, during slow wave sleep, and at other individualized intervals."
"GH is necessary for normal linear growth and greatly influences intermediary metabolism by way of its induction of somatomedins  from target tissues most notably including the liver, chondrocytes, kidney, muscle, pituitary and the gastrointestinal tract. The hypothalamic regulation of GH secretion is illustrative of the mechanisms that govern all hormones of the anterior pituitary. Release is controlled by Growth hormone releasing hormone  a 39 amino acid peptide that is primarily synthesized in the arcuate nucleus."
"GHRH release from the arcuate nucleus is stimulated by inputs from other brain regions using the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and the enkephalins. Release of GHRH is inhibited by somatostatin and very importantly, by the actions of GH and IGF. The regulation of GHRH release by somatostatin is an example of ultra-short loop feedback, regulation of release by GH is an example of short-loop feedback, and regulation by IGF is an example of indirect long loop feedback."
"Prolactin. Prolactin is necessary for lactation and is secreted by pituitary lactotrophs, which constitute 15 to 20 percent of the cells in the normal pituitary. Control of prolactin secretion by the hypothalamus is unique to that of the other anterior pituitary hormones in that under normal circumstances it is restrained and not elicited."
Dopamine released from the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei acts on D2 receptors to increase adenyl cyclase in lactotrophs and inhibit prolactin release. Increases in plasma prolactin induces increased levels of dopamine in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei and so establishes short-loop feedback. Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone control the gonads in men and women.
"These hormones are secreted by the gonadotrophs, which comprise about 10 percent of the adenohypophysis. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone  is the hypothalamic factor that controls release of the gonadotrophs and primarily is released itself from the arcuate nucleus. Feedback regulation of LHRH is provided by low levels of estrogen in females and by testosterone in males."
Thyroid-stimulating hormone  is secreted by about 5 percent of the cells in the pituitary called thyrotrophs and regulates thyroid function. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone  is found in the highest concentrations in the medial division of the paraventricular nucleus. The thyroid hormones thyroxine  and triiodothyronine  inhibit TSH production and release at the level of the pituitary  and inhibit the release of TRH at the level of the hypothalamus .
Adrenocorticotropin  controls glucocorticoid function of the adrenal cortex. ACTH is produced by the corticotrophs that comprise the remaining 15 percent of pituitary cells as part of the larger pro-opiomelanocortin gene product from which γ-melanocyte stimulating hormone and ß-endorphin are also derived. ACTH is released in pulses with an overall circadian rhythm peak at around 4 AM and a trough in the early evening.
"Corticotropin releasing-factor  is the primary but not the only hypothalamic factor that regulates ACTH release. CRH is primarily found in the paraventricular nucleus. The release of both ACTH and CRH are inhibited by the hormone cortisol secreted from the adrenal, and the release of both are strongly stimulated by stress."
"Disorders of every hormone of the anterior pituitary have been identified and are characterized by either a hypo-secretion or over-secretion following various lesions, trauma, or tumors. Acromegaly and Gigantism results from excess GH in adults and in children, respectively. More than a cosmetic disease, these conditions are associated with multiple system problems such as headaches, poor vision, sinus congestion, congestive heart failure, impotence, kidney stones, paresthesias, weakness, and arthritis and is associated with a shortened life span."
"Dwarfism results from insufficient GH in children, while decreased GH in adults is usually cryptic. However, GH supplements are finding utility in restoring vigor in aged individuals. Hyperprolactinaemia has many causes, is evidenced by hypogonadism and/or galactorrhea, and associated with pituitary adenomas , hypothalamic or renal disease."
"Prolactin deficiency is evidenced by an inability to lactate and often the first sign panhypopituitarism resulting from pituitary infarction in the post-partum period  Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism occurs as a central, congenital or inherited disorder  and an acquired secondary disorder. In Kallmann’s Syndrome the LHRH-producing cells of the hypothalamus fail to migrate during development from the olfactory placode into the brain. Acquired deficits occur as a result of hyperprolactinemia , anorexia, starvation, and stress."
"Hypergonadotropism can occur with pituitary tumors as well as from ectopic hormone-producing tumors of the lung, liver and germinal cell lines. Hypothyroidism can result due to failure of the thyroid gland  or following pituitary or hypothalamic disease . The primary form of the disease will result in hypertrophy of the thyrotrophs that can result in pituitary enlargement resulting in visual field deficits."
"Pituitary  Hyperthyroidism is usually not a cause of hyperthyroidism but may occur in two conditions. First, pituitary macroadenomas are associated with overproduction of the alpha subunit of TSH. Second, pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone can occur."
"Cushing’s disease is characterized by central distribution of adipose, muscle weakness, purplish striae, hypertension, osteoporosis, fatigue and psychiatric changes. Primary Cushing’s disease. These usually are the result of microadenomas of the pituitary in over 90 percent of cases and result due to macroadenomas in most of the remaining cases."
"Ectopic ACTH production is not uncommon with some fast-growing tumors such as oat cell carcinoma of the lung, but in these conditions the physical signs of hypercortisolemia are less pronounced. Rather, hypokalemia, muscle weakness, weight loss and hyperpigmentation characterize patients. Ectopic ACTH produced by slower growing tumors show more characteristics of typical Cushing’s disease."
Overproduction of CRF is a rare cause of Cushing’s disease. ACTH deficiency is also called secondary adrenal insufficiency. It may reversibly occur following prolonged glucocorticoid administration.
"Important bi-directional interactions between the immune system and the nervous and neuroendocrine systems have become defined over the past twenty years . These interactions account for modification of immune system function by nervous system activity and contrawise, modification of behavior, metabolism and neuroendocrine function by activity within the immune system compartment. The cascade of behavioral responses induced by activation of the immune system is termed the acute phase response, while the influence of brain activity on immunity has been termed psychoneuroimmunology."
"The Acute Phase Response. The acute phase response is a constellation of behavioral and physiological changes that occur following invasion of the body by pathogens or tissue injury that we know as “feeling sick”, and thus also called sickness behavior. Fever is one component of the acute phase response ."
"Other components include an increase in slow wave sleep, anorexia, affective and cognitive impairment, decreased social and sexual behavior and lowered pain threshold. In addition, there are changes in blood chemistry including an increase in C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, a2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, plasma zinc and copper, and a decrease in plasma iron. Changes in these proteins and elements are mediated by the liver following neural input that arises in the hypothalamus."
These changes are geared to reallocate energy resources to the generation of fever and the proliferation of immune cells and to induce as hostile an environment to invading pathogens as possible. There are four primary cytokine mediators of this response. Interleukin-1β  is the chief mediator of the acute phase response following infection.
"There are two additional members of the IL-1 family, IL-1a and IL-1 receptor antagonist, but neither of these have any effect in producing the acute phase response. IL-1β exerts its effects within the CNS by induction of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase type 2  in endothelial cells of the vasculature at the circumventricular organs, especially the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminals . Induction of this enzyme results in the generation of prostaglandin E2  that passes through the fenestrated blood brain barrier and binds to the type 4 prostanoid receptor ."
"Receptor binding raises cyclic adenosine monophosphate  in neurons of the hypothalamus and brainstem, most notably the preoptic anterior, paraventricular, and A2 nuclei, which induces fever, activates the neuroendocrine axis and stimulates hepatic acute phase protein synthesis and release. An alternate mechanism that may contribute to other aspects of sickness behavior is the binding of IL-1β to the receptors on the subdiaphragmatic vagus. Projections from the nucleus tractus solitarius to the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and other limbic sites are proposed to induce somnolence, anorexia, irritability and cognitive impairment."
"This pathway and the central release of PGE2 has also been suggested to induce the mirror-like CNS generation of cytokines that is observed with activation of the immune system. The CNS sources of cytokines, such as IL-1β, interferons, and TNF are from activated astrocytes, lie in the figure at right, as well as from microglia and neurons. Interleukin-6 does not induce the acute phase response when injected alone, yet nevertheless is the most potent agent for prolonged induction of acute phase proteins when injected to the brain of animals already primed by interleukin-1."
"Most likely these effects are because IL-6 receptor  is expressed at low levels in non-primed animals, but the receptor is up-regulated during induction of sickness responses. Thus, it has been proposed that IL-6 functions to sustain the acute phase response that is triggered by IL-1β. Activation of the neuroendocrine axis by IL-1ß and IL-6 results in elevated plasma cortisol that in turn suppresses COX2 and IL-6R expression."
"This feedback is essential for termination of the acute phase response as the illness resolves. The interferons  and tumor necrosis factor. These agents are much less potent than those above, yet play especially prevalent roles in the sickness responses with viral and neoplastic illnesses."
"Other hormones produced by lymphoid cells include a whole constellation we have already discussed including GH, Prolactin, ACTH, TSH, β-endorphin and enkephalins that may also be involved in the signal pathways between the immune system and the CNS. Psychoneuroimmunology refers to the pathways that underlie brain-induced modifications of immune system function. These pathways include the neuroendocrine system as well as inputs to all lymphoid tissues from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems."
"Immunological responses can be conditioned like any other biological response and so, components of many common diseases ranging from asthma to cancer have been correlated to various behavioral traits. Stress. Demographic studies of merchant marine from World War I detected high early mortality rates from a variety of causes."
This suggested the idea that chronic stress is an immune suppressant. Cortisol was subsequently shown to be a powerful direct inhibitor of all lymphoid process and so became a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. Later stressful stimuli adequate to induce CRF release from the hypothalamus were experimentally shown to result in immune suppression.
"However, as research has progressed it has become clear that stress per se is not always counter productive to immunity. Low levels of stress act to redistribute lymphoid cells from storage compartments such as the spleen into the circulation. Similarly, low levels of cortisol, such as those normally provoked by infection, act to focus the immune response by creation of a type of lateral inhibition so that only those cell lines with the most focused epitopes and so most strongly activated to proliferate continue to expand."
"Thus, the stress response can be subdivided into eustress, which is beneficial to immunity, and distress, which is immunosuppressive. Circadian Susceptibility to Disease is a direct consequence of the nervous system’s impact on immunological functions . The levels of hormones and tone in the autonomic nervous system fluctuate through the course of the day."
"Immunological function tends to be most suppressed early in the morning when the body is at its lowest level of sympathetic tone and highest level of adrenocorticotropic activity. In converse, immunological function is at its peak in the evening as sympathetic tone peaks. Patients almost always feel their best in the early morning hours and feel their worst in the evening."
"Paradoxically, the peak in autonomic and neuroendocrine function in the evening results in peak physical performance in healthy individuals at this same time of day. Secretion of the posterior pituitary hormones is directly from magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei into the circulation. These neurons project axons into the posterior pituitary via the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract and terminate on a capillary bed of the inferior hypophyseal artery."
"Control of release in this system is under neural control and so this represents a reflex system with neural input and hormonal output. Secretion of anterior pituitary hormones is driven by the influence of releasing, or release-inhibiting hormones  that are synthesized in parvocellular neurons of the supraoptic, paraventricular, arcuate and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei. These neurons project axons in the tuberoinfundibular tract onto a capillary bed of the superior hypophyseal artery at the base of the median eminence."
"These capillaries coalesce into the hypophyseal portal veins, which descend to the anterior pituitary and form a second capillary bed where the anterior pituitary hormones are released. The anterior pituitary hormones diffuse to peripheral targets to provoke release of endocrine hormones that induced tissue effects. Control of release in this system is via feedback of releasing-hormones, anterior pituitary hormones, and peripheral endocrine hormones onto hypothalamic and pituitary cells in a series of feedback loops."
This system thus represents a hormone-and neural-evoked and hormone-output reflex. The immune system provokes neural and neuroendocrine responses in an acute phase “sickness” response to illness or injury. The immune system is also influenced by neural activity.
"Because many students have been led to believe that the autonomic nervous system is relatively primitive, most have concluded that normal regulation of this system occurs at ganglionic, or at best, spinal levels. Thus, they are often quite surprised to discover that dysfunction of the brain is typically accompanied by autonomic dysfunction that can be life-threatening. For example, patients with spinal transection can have severe hypertensive crises provoked by a full bladder, impacted colon, or even stroking of the skin."
"This is not to say that the spinal cord and autonomic ganglia do not play important roles in autonomic regulation. But, that the organization of autonomic output takes place at supraspinal levels. Extensive interconnection occurs between sites receiving visceral inputs and that control autonomic efferent outputs, between sites for the control of sympathetic versus parasympathetic nervous system output, and between sites for autonomic control and somatic, endocrine and limbic circuitry."
"Collectively, this set of interconnections is termed the central autonomic network. The central autonomic network is composed of both hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic nuclei. Some of these sites regulate sympathetic outflow whereas others regulate parasympathetic outflow."
"This structure was first revealed in lesion studies that revealed multisynaptic connections descending from the hypothalamus and midbrain to preganglionic neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. Similarly, connections from various limbic brain structures, most especially the amygdala, through the hypothalamus have been demonstrated. The net result of this network in full operation is the induction of autonomic responses to visceral and somatic stress stimuli, such as elevated heart rate and blood pressure with the onset of pain."
"Alternatively, chronic hypertension in type “A” or stressed individuals represents increased central autonomic outflow in response to increased limbic system input. Hierarchy in the autonomic network results in the loops from the brainstem to spinal cord being responsible for rapid short-term regulation of the autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-brainstem-spinal cord pathways serving longer-term, metabolic and reproductive regulation, and finally limbic system-hypothalamic-brainstem-spinal cord loops serving anticipatory autonomic regulation. Hypothalamic Structures."
The single most important hypothalamic nucleus of the central autonomic network is the paraventricular nucleus . The PVN has two morphological classes of neurons that fall into three functional categories. The first morphological class is comprised of magnocellular  neurons.
These neurons contain vasopressin and oxytocin and project their axons into the posterior pituitary where these hormones are released directly into the blood stream. The second morphological class is comprised of parvocellular  neurons. The parvocellular PVN neurons also include a neuroendocrine-related functional subset that project to the median eminence and secrete releasing hormones into the hypophyseal portal blood stream for control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion.
"More on these two functional groups will be covered in the next chapter. Finally, a group of parvocellular neurons comprise the third functional group of PVN neurons with these involved in central autonomic control. There are three types of pre-autonomic parvocellular neurons  separable based on anatomical and physiological criteria, as well as based on subnuclear location within the PVN."
"Pre-autonomic PVN neurons project directly onto preganglionic autonomic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the autonomic relay nuclei of the brainstem  and even directly to the intermediolateral spinal columns. These projections descend ipsilaterally through the brainstem and spinal cord with four points of decussation , lamina X of the spinal cord) so that ultimately innervation is bilateral but with an ipsilateral dominance. Thus, the PVN, unlike any other brain site, has direct influence over both sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow."
"Furthermore, the PVN receives direct sympathetic and parasympathetic afferent inputs from trigeminal pars caudalis  and the nucleus of the solitary tract . The PVN therefore is the only brain site in a closed efferent-afferent reflex loop with both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Other hypothalamic nuclei in the central autonomic network include the dorsomedial nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, the posterior hypothalamic nucleus and the mammillary nucleus."
"These nuclei send and receive projections from the PVN, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the central gray matter, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral and ventral medulla and the intermediolateral spinal columns. The lateral hypothalamus is especially involved in cardiovascular control as well as in control of feeding, satiety and insulin release. Extra-hypothalamic Structures."
Numerous brain structures were itemized above as innervation targets of the hypothalamic structures of the central autonomic network. These extra-hypothalamic sites can be roughly divided into those associated with control of the two components of the autonomic nervous system. The sites associated with control of sympathetic outflow include the norepinephrine-containing neurons of the dorsal mesencephalon  and the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla  and the serotonin-containing neurons of the pontine and medullary raphe nuclei.
"The extra-hypothalamic sites associated with control of parasympathetic outflow include the central nucleus of the amygdala, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus ambiguous, the raphe nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, and the parabrachial nucleus. Finally, limbic cortices, including the cingulate, orbitofrontal, insular and rhinal cortices, and the hippocampus influence both sets of autonomic outflow. The hypothalamus is interconnected with the remainder of the central autonomic network by way of three major pathways: the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus, the medial forebrain bundle, and the mammillotegmental tract."
The principal pathway of the hypothalamus in the central autonomic network is the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus . The DLF originates in the region of the paraventricular nucleus and descends along the most medial aspect of the third ventricle through the periaqueductal gray and mesencephalic reticular formation. The DLF continues caudally in the midline near the floor of the fourth ventricle until the closure of the open medulla where it becomes internalized near the central canal remnant.
"This position leaves the DLF in ideal position to innervate the periaqueductal gray, the parabrachial nucleus, the mesencephalic raphe nuclei, and the locus ceruleus rostrally and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus ambiguous and the medullary raphe more caudally. The centralized location of the DLF as it continues into the lower medulla and then the spinal cord renders it in perfect location to innervate the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons of the intermediolateral spinal cord. As detailed above the DLF projections are bilateral, though with an ipsilateral dominance, due to several points of decussation."
"Afferent inputs from the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and the locus ceruleus ascend through the DLF to the hypothalamus. The medial forebrain bundle  is the primary route for input to the hypothalamus from the septal nuclei and basal forebrain limbic structures. Inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus, though first arriving to the hypothalamus by way of the stria terminalis, ventral amygdalofugal pathway, and fornix, ultimately join with the MFB and thereby gain access to the paraventricular nucleus."
"The MFB also has fibers from the paraventricular nucleus that descend to innervate essentially the same nuclei as that by the DLF. Visceral afferents from the nucleus of the solitary tract ascend from the brainstem into the hypothalamus by way of the MFB. The MFB, like the DLF has several points of decussation so that there is input to bilateral structures but with an ipsilateral dominance."
"The mammillotegmental tract is less prominent than either the DLF or MFB nevertheless, this pathway that originates in the mammillary nucleus sends projections into the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formations that in turn influence the activity of the brainstem autonomic nuclei listed above. Somatic afferents ascend to the hypothalamus by way of the spinohypothalamic tract. Autonomic Dysreflexia is a condition observed in about 85 percent of patients following spinal cord injury above C6."
"Exaggerated autonomic reflexes, especially sudden dramatic increases in blood pressure are provoked by inappropriate stimuli, such as pressure on the bladder. Riley-Day Syndrome  is an autosomal recessive disorder in Ashkenazi Jews associated with decreased tearing and sensitivity to pain and absent fungiform papillae on the tongue. Episodic abdominal crises and fever are very common as is orthostatic hypotension."
"Shy-Drager Syndrome is a progressive degenerative condition of unknown origin affecting cells of the central autonomic network in the brainstem, intermediolateral cell column, locus ceruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and other nuclei including the substantia nigra caudate nucleus, and cerebellum. The presence of Lewy bodies in many of these areas suggests this syndrome may be related to Parkinson’s disease, in which there is also often a high degree of autonomic dysfunction. The hallmark sign is profound orthostatic hypotension without a compensatory increase in heart rate."
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is thought to be a developmental defect in the central autonomic network of the brainstem involved with respiratory drive. An abrupt increase in facial skin temperature related to the onset of periods of apnea suggest there may be a broader developmental defect of central autonomic control. Horner’s Syndrome typically results following damage to the dorsolateral pons or medulla and is characterized by a profound disturbance in sympathetic nervous system function.
"A common cause of this type of lesion is thrombosis of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or following damage to the white matter of the cervical spinal cord where the hypothalamic-spinal tract descends. The most common signs in Horner’s syndrome are ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis and erythema. As noted above, the central autonomic network consists of three hierarchically ordered circuits or loops: the short-term brainstem-spinal loops, and the limbic brain-hypothalamic-brainstem-spinal cord loops mediating anticipatory and stress responses, and the intermediate length hypothalamic-brainstem-spinal cord loops mediating longer-term autonomic reflexes."
Here we focus on this later loop in its role in thermoregulation. A later chapter will focus on this loop in the regulation of feeding. The Hypothalamic Basis of Temperature Set-Point.
Regulation of core temperature is essential because most of the metabolic processes necessary for life are strongly temperature-dependent. The normal body temperature set-point is primarily determined by the activity of neurons in the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic nuclei as well as by neurons in the adjoining medial septal nuclei. Collectively this region is often termed the preoptic anterior hypothalamus .
"The second region that also plays a critical, though subservient role to the POAH, in temperature regulation is the posterior hypothalamus. It was previously mentioned that the hypothalamus is one of the few brain areas where CNS neurons reside that are themselves directly sensitive to physical or chemical variables such as temperature, plasma osmolality, plasma glucose, and various hormones. The POAH has three types of neurons involved in determining the temperature set-point, warm-sensitive neurons, cold-sensitive neurons, and temperature-insensitive neurons, that are defined by changes in discharge rate following local warming or cooling of the POAH."
Warm-sensitive neurons comprise about 30% of the neuronal pool in the POAH. These neurons have a firing rate versus temperature as shown in Figure 3. 4.
"Change in temperature below 37 degrees has little effect on discharge rate. However, as temperature rises above 37 degrees the discharge rate of these neurons increases dramatically. Activation of warm-sensitive neurons results in an activation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus  and lateral hypothalamus that result in heightened parasympathetic outflow to promote the dissipation of heat."
"Cold-sensitive neurons which are only about 5% of the cell population in the POAH, but more prevalent in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, have discharge properties opposite that of warm-sensitive neurons. The cold-sensitive neurons show low rates of discharge at temperatures above 37 degrees, but increase firing rate steeply as temperature is lowered below 37 degrees. Increased discharges in cold-sensitive neurons results in activation of neurons in the PVN and the posterior hypothalamus that increase sympathetic outflow to promote the generation and conservation of heat."
"The relative concentration of warm-sensitive neurons in the POAH that promote heat loss and of cold-sensitive neurons in the posterior hypothalamus that promote heat generation has resulted in the POAH often being termed as the heat dissipation center and the posterior hypothalamus being labeled as the heat generation/conservation center. The final group of neurons found in the POAH and posterior hypothalamus is the temperature-insensitive neurons. These are by-far the most numerous of the neurons in these nuclei, comprising greater than 60 percent of those in the POAH."
Although by definition not sensitive to changes in temperature these neurons play a crucial role in heat generation/conservation as discussed below. The master circuit in regulation of body temperature is heat dissipation. The warm-sensitive neurons of the POAH have intrinsic membrane receptors that are sensitive to changes in brain and blood temperature above 37 degrees.
These are non-specific cation channels that very likely are related to the vanilloid  family of thermoreceptors. Warm-sensitive neurons also receive excitatory inputs from cutaneous and spinal thermoreceptors. As illustrated in Figure 3.
"4, inputs from cutaneous receptors induce a leftward bias in the firing rates of hypothalamic warm-sensitive neurons, so that baseline discharge rate is greatly elevated. Interestingly, though the firing rate of these cells continues to increase with increases in body temperature, the slope of this increase is reduced. Thus, the drive to dissipate heat is actively driven by inputs from thermal receptors."
"It is not clear that such is the case for heat generation and conservation. Cool-sensitive neurons do not appear to have intrinsic temperature-sensitive receptors. Rather, the increase in discharge observed in cool-sensitive cells with cooling results from the decreases in discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons and subsequent disinhibition so that the cool-sensitive neurons are now driven by tonic inputs from the thermal-insensitive neurons."
"Thus, the temperature set-point is principally a function of activity in warm-sensitive neurons of the POAH. The short-term effects of output from both warm- and cool-sensitive neurons on body temperature occur as a result of changes in autonomic tone to cutaneous arterioles and so the amount of cutaneous blood flow. Changes in sympathetic outflow to sweat glands and adipose tissue provide additional targets used for heat dissipation and generation."
Longer-term effects of these groups of neurons in response to sustained changes in environmental temperature include the induction of behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to changes in environmental temperature. Fever. The statement above highlights well the fact that fever has been a scourge battled by physicians since antiquity.
"However, recently fever has become recognized as in fact only one in a constellation of physiological adaptations that take place during infection referred to as the “sickness” or “acute phase response”. The sickness response includes behavioral, cognitive, metabolic, and neuroendocrine adaptations that are all geared to make the body less hospitable to pathogens and most primed for optimizing immunological defenses. Thus, fever is initiated because most bacteria proliferate poorly at temperatures above 39 degrees, whereas the function of lymphoid cells is optimal at this temperature."
"Fever is initiated during infection following the activation of macrophages and the subsequent synthesis and release of endogenous pyrogenic substances including interleukin-1 , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-6 , and the interferons . These pyrogens enter the blood stream and exert their effects in the CNS at the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis . As discussed in the previous section, the OVLT is one of several sites in the CNS where the blood brain barrier is relatively permeable and so allows the brain to “taste” the internal milieu of the body."
"The endothelial cells of the OVLT have receptors for the endogenous pyrogens that when activated cause both the synthesis and release into the CNS of prostanoids, in particular, prostaglandin E2  as well as the synthesis and release within the CNS of IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and IFN. PGE2 gains access to the warm-sensitive cells of the POAH immediately adjacent to the OVLT where it binds to surface receptors and induces increases in cellular levels of cyclic AMP. The increased cAMP activates the protein kinase A system resulting in reduced excitability of the warm-sensitive neurons and lowering of their discharge rate."
"This allows the discharge rate of the cool-sensitive neurons to increase thus, establishing a new, higher temperature set-point. The use of antipyretics such as aspirin and indomethacin counteracts fever by interrupting the synthesis of PGE2 through antagonism of the cyclooxygenase enzyme system in the endothelium of the OVLT. Heat Exhaustion."
"Prolonged exposure or over-exertion in very warm environments can result in an excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes resulting in muscle cramps, dizziness, vomiting and fainting. In extreme conditions a degree of hypotension can develop. However, heat exhaustion is distinguished from heat stroke in that the body temperature set-point remains well regulated and the mechanisms mediating heat dissipation are intact."
"Thus, the skin is cool and moist and body temperature is normal or slightly below normal. Rest and replacement of fluids and electrolytes quickly remedy this condition. Heat Stroke."
If heat exhaustion is not remedied it can progress to heat stroke. Extreme hypotension will result in a drop in cutaneous blood flow and decrease in perspiration. Core temperature will subsequently rise.
If this rise is too severe the brain’s normal functioning can be interrupted and control of the temperature set-point fails. This results in further deterioration of the heat dissipation mechanisms and allows core temperature to rise further so that tissue damage ensues which can lead to coma and then death. This heat stroke patient is in a medical emergency and requires urgent lowering of core temperature by fluid and electrolyte replacement.
Hepatic damage is common in this condition and jaundice may develop 1 to 2 days after admission. Acute oliguric renal failure may occur. The development of coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation are very poor prognostic factors.
"Malignant Hyperthermia is a group of inherited disorders characterized by sudden and extreme increases in core temperature following exposure to gaseous anesthetics including halothane, methoxyflurane, cyclopropane, or ethyl ether; or following exposure to muscle relaxants, particularly succinylcholine. These agents provoke an excessive release of calcium from the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in activation of myosin ATPase and so excess heat generation. One form of the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion while a second is inherited in a recessive manner in boys and less often in girls that also have a number of other congenital abnormalities that comprise King’s syndrome."
"Malignant hyperthermia also sometimes occurs with other myopathies such as myotonia congenita and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy. Some patients show an elevated creatinine phosphokinase, but most are normal between attacks. Biopsied muscle will show abnormal contraction on exposure to caffeine or gas anesthetic, but this is obviously a clumsy manner to screen for the condition."
"Careful history of surgical complications in relatives and identification of other contributing conditions is the best way to detect and prevent malignant hyperthermia. Occurrence is a medical emergency and requires immediate institution of the treatment protocol prescribed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The surgery and gas anesthetic is stopped, all tubing from the anesthetic devices are changed, and external cooling is initiated."
"One hundred percent oxygen, 1-2mg/kg sodium bicarbonate, and 1mg/kg dantrolene sodium are given. Drugs for cardiac arrhythmias are given as needed. Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature of 35 degrees or lower and represents a potential medical emergency."
"Accidental hypothermia is common in winter following prolonged exposure, not necessarily to excessively low temperatures, and may accompany sepsis, hypothyroidism, pituitary or adrenal insufficiency, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction and the ingestion of drugs - particularly alcohol. However, hypothermia can also occur in certain medical conditions without exposure, including congestive heart failure, uremia, drug overdose, acute respiratory failure, and hypoglycemia. Most of these patients are elderly."
"Patients presenting with a core temperature of less than 26. 7 degrees are usually unconscious, miotic, bradypneic, bradycardic, and hypotensive with generalized edema. At core temperatures below 25 degrees patients are in coma, areflexic and may appear in rigor mortis."
Treatment requires establishing an airway and providing oxygen. Blood volume can be expanded with warmed glucose while the blood gases and cardiac rhythm are carefully monitored. External warming is applied to the thorax only so that the limbs remain vasoconstricted to prevent a precipitous drop in blood pressure.
"Several forebrain, diencephalic and brainstem structures are interconnected to organize the output of the autonomic nervous system. Collectively, this is referred to as the central autonomic network and is further organized into a hierarchy of functional loops. The hypothalamus is the key brain site for central control of the autonomic nervous system, and the paraventricular nucleus is the key hypothalamic site for this control."
The major pathway from the hypothalamus for autonomic control is the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus. Regulation of body temperature is one example of hypothalamic control of brainstem and spinal autonomic nuclei related to longer-term autonomic reflexes. Thermoregulation is principally a function of warm-sensitive neurons of the preoptic anterior hypothalamus that directly control the dissipation of heat.
"Fever is the most common disorder of thermoregulation. Fever is following the release of endogenous pyrogens that elevate the level of prostaglandin E2 in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus, which causes a decrease in activity of warm-sensitive neurons and subsequent disinhibition of cool-sensitive neurons. Feeding by its nature is intermittent, yet the need for energy in tissues is constant."
"Thus, mechanisms have evolved for the ebb and flow of nutrients after feeding and during the post-absorptive period; and the maintenance of near-normal function during fasting. The remarkable stability of body weight in persons with access to adequate food supplies is testament to the precision by which metabolic needs are monitored and maintained. Aberrations in these controls can produce serious and even life-threatening conditions."
Two major hypotheses have been put forward to account for the process by which the usual balance in caloric intake is established. The Depletion-repletion Hypothesis. The depletion-repletion hypothesis is essentially based on the idea of a caloric set-point.
"In its simplest version individuals match energy expenditure and energy intake without reference to the level of fat storage. In more complicated models fat  depots, and presumably other nutrient depots, send signals to the brain about their current status. These inputs are compared to desired set points and food intake and energy expenditure are modified to effect adjustments to the levels of stores."
"The best evidence for this view is from small mammals. Glucose-responsive neurons that increase firing rate with glucose levels and glucose-sensitive neurons that are stimulated as glucose levels fall have been identified. Further, small mammals will habitually return to a body mass that is appropriate for their age, stage of development and/or environment after a forced perturbation."
"Thus, rats exposed to a period of food restriction or imposed overfeeding  express a compensatory hyper- or hypophagia on return to ad libitum feeding. The current studies on leptin  has heightened interest in this potential mechanism. The Primed Response Hypothesis."
This hypothesis essentially boils down to the idea that animals will eat whenever an opportunity presents itself unless it is specifically inhibited. Evidence in support of this idea comes from studies examining the relationship between caloric content in meals and feeding intervals. There is not a correlation between the amount eaten in a meal and the interval to the previous meal.
"Rather, the larger a given meal, the longer it will be to the next. This suggests that eating is inhibited by satiety signals generated in response to a meal. There are two main issues in the concept of satiety."
"The first concerns the mechanisms that contribute to the termination of feeding at a given meal, whereas the second concerns the mechanisms that govern interprandial intervals. These mechanisms overlap to a degree. Neural Signals are essentially dependent on the vagus and involve both afferent and efferent components."
"The afferent signals in the vagus conveyed to the brain that function to limit meal size include information from stretch receptors in the stomach wall, and sensors in the portal blood vessels for cholecystokinin , glucose, osmolality and pH. All these stimuli limit meal size. Vagal afferents synapse in the nucleus of the solitary tract."
"In addition, the vagus sends afferents to the area postrema. These sites send projections to the paraventricular nucleus to inhibit feeding. The vagus also functions in an afferent capacity in that input from the vagus to the pancreas mediates the cephalic phase of insulin release."
The sight and smell of food initiates activity in limbic cortex that in turn activates the central autonomic network. Outflow to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and finally to the pancreas results in the first surge of insulin in the blood that accompanies a meal. Two additional increases in plasma insulin later occur as food enters the gut  and then as nutrients enter the intestines .
"In fact, these stimuli also result in satiety as insulin not only promotes energy storage but also acts as a humoral signal back to the brain for satiety. Humoral Signals for satiety are an extremely hot topic of research due to the vast potential weight-control market. The main factors in the blood that affect the CNS to limit/promote feeding are insulin, leptin, glucose, and CCK."
"Insulin, leptin and glucose gain access to the CNS at the circumventricular organs of the median eminence and the area postrema and act on specific receptors in neurons of the nuclear cell groups adjoining these areas. Insulin and leptin have received considerable recent interest as the mediators of satiety signals related to the caloric content of a meal and in relation to maintenance of a body weight set point, respectively. Chief among the CNS sites of action for these compounds as discussed below is the arcuate nucleus."
"CCK exerts its chief effects on satiety in the periphery by an action on the vagus to potentiate the responses to glucose, pH, and osmolality in the portal blood. CCK derived from neurons in the hypothalamus is also a transmitter substance in the CNS satiety network . The Dual Center Hypothesis evolved about fifty years ago when it was demonstrated that bilateral lesions placed in the region of the ventromedial hypothalamus  produced a condition of voracious appetite and resulting marked hyperphagia."
"These animals would ultimately become remarkably obese. On the other hand, bilateral lesions of the ventrolateral hypothalamus  produced an anorexic condition that resulted in animals failing to feed and ultimately wasting. The assumption behind this set of experiments was that there are specific feeding and satiety centers."
"The conclusion in this set of experiments was that the feeding center was the VLH and the satiety center was the VMH. Although this dual center hypothesis has proven useful, the CNS satiety network has proven to be more complex. More recent repetitions of the earlier lesion studies showed that in fact animals with VMH lesions would not eat continually without limit, nor would the animals with VLH lesions necessarily starve to death."
"Rather, the VMH lesioned animals would eat excessively until they reached some new higher body weight at which point they would then reduce their food consumption to maintain this new set point. Likewise, once the VLH lesioned animals had dropped to some new level, they would again eat normally to maintain the new lower body weight set-point. These studies indicate that satiety and feeding is a balancing process between two major groups of neurochemical pathways that ultimately govern the relative tone between the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the central autonomic network."
The main entry points for information to this network are both neural and humoral. The neural inputs are from the vagus nerve via synapses in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the area postrema as well as inputs from the raphe nuclei. These inputs ascend in the medial forebrain bundle to the paraventricular and the lateral hypothalamic area .
The humoral inputs pass the circumventricular organs and affect the area postrema and the arcuate nucleus. The arcuate nucleus projects into the LHA and the ventromedial nucleus as well as to the paraventricular and dorsomedial  nucleus. The paraventricular nucleus returns inputs to the arcuate nucleus as well as to the VMH and LHA.
"There are no direct interconnections between the VMH and LHA, rather these are processed through the DM. Neurochemistry. Several peptides are involved in hypothalamic regulation of feeding and body mass."
"These can be sorted based on their behavioral effects into anabolic/orexigenic peptides that promote feeding and increase of body mass or as catabolic/anorexigenic peptides. Each set of peptides includes what appears to be a key signal molecule that promotes either feeding or satiety as well as an antagonist of the opposing stimulus. nabolic/orexigenic peptides include neuropeptide Y , agouti-related protein , melanin-concentrating hormone , orexin, and galanin."
NPY is the key feeding-promoting neuropeptide and NPY receptor subtype 5 is the key site of action. NPY increases in the arcuate nucleus within 6 hours of food deprivation. Of note the neurons that express NPY in rodents also express receptors for leptin and insulin and so are yoked to plasma-derived feeding signals.
"AGRP is an antagonist for the anorexigenic peptides as it blocks the MC3 and 4 receptors for γ- and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormones, respectively. Catabolic/anorexigenic peptides include a-melanocyte stimulating hormone , cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript , glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2  and prolactin-releasing peptide . These peptides fall with food deprivation and conversely rise with forced overfeeding."
"For example, corticotropin-releasing factor  increases in the paraventricular nucleus  and pro-opiomelanocortin  increases in the arcuate nucleus with overfeeding. The key anorexigenic signals are α- and less so γ-MSH acting at the MC4 and MC3 receptors, respectively. The antagonist in this group for the orexigenic peptide NPY is CART."
"Obesity is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue, however, the exact definition of “excess” is somewhat enigmatic. The simplest way to define “excess” is that amount of adipose tissue that creates a health risk. The best index at present is that this represents an amount of adipose tissue that puts an individual 20% or greater above their ideal body weight."
"Using these criteria somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of adults are obese with these rates over-representative by minorities and the poor. Excess intake of calories is the usual major contributor to obesity. Basal metabolic rate in a 70kg man is about 1500 calories/day, so anything above this in a sedentary, healthy individual will result in weight gain."
Another mechanism besides excess caloric intake that may contribute to obesity is the lipoprotein lipase hypothesis in which an excess of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase preferentially stores lipid calories as adipose tissue. Obesity has several important metabolic sequela that can contribute to additional medical problems. Hyperinsulinemia with hyper- or euglycemia.
"Insulin resistance may develop due to an abnormal beta cell product, circulating antibodies or tissue insulin insensitivity. Insulin insensitivity results due to a combination of receptor and post-receptor defects in insulin action. Hyperlipoproteinemia."
"Obesity is characterized by elevated VLDL and elevated serum triglyceride and an increase in serum free fatty acid turnover. Hypertension, Hypoventilation  are often observed in the obese patient. Other endocrine disorders may also develop."
"Froehlich’s Syndrome is characterized by obesity, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and other variable features including diabetes insipidus, visual impairment and mental retardation. It is thought to result due to a hypothalamic lesion. Anorexia Nervosa is a disorder almost exclusively seen in young, white women of middle-class background, with a prevalence of as high as 1 per 100 being reported."
Subclinical prevalence may be as high as 5 percent. Diagnosis is made on a clinical basis as there is no diagnostic test. Patients observed to be below about 80% of ideal body weight are suspect when no other medical  causes can be identified.
"A disordered attitude toward eating, food or weight that overrides hunger, ritualized exercise, amenorrhea, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia complete the usual clinical picture. Patients with anorexia are vulnerable to sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. There is no specific treatment as yet because the underlying mechanisms are not defined."
"However, a recent study has shown that a significant number of these patients and those with bulimia have plasma antibodies against pituitary and hypothalamic melanotropes and/or corticotropes suggesting an underlying autoimmune disorder. Bulimia is often considered a disorder related to anorexia nervosa. The disorder is characterized by the episodic ingestion of large amounts of food in a compulsive fashion  coupled with the awareness that the eating pattern is abnormal, that it cannot be stopped, and depression at completion of the act."
"There is usually a morbid fear of becoming fat, although body weight is usually in the normal range. Induced vomiting that eventually becomes reflexive usually follows episodes of binge eating. Patients frequently have additional behavioral/psychiatric abnormalities."
Caloric homeostasis is maintained by a body weight set point. This set point is at least in part maintained by a set of signals from peripheral energy stores into the brain that stimulate feeding to maintain adequate stores of nutrients. Feeding also appears to largely occur as a primed response whenever food is available and that continues until inhibitory satiety signals are received in the brain that are derived from a meal.
Cessation of feeding in a given meal and the time to the next meal is determined by neural and humoral signals derived from that meal. The neural signals come from the vagus and include information concerning the size  and caloric/nutrient content . The CNS satiety network is a subdivision of the central autonomic network.
"Thus, it includes the brainstem afferent and efferent relays for the vagus as well as the brainstem sympathetic relays such as nuclear group A2 and the raphe system. The arcuate nucleus and less so the area postrema are key sites for registration of humoral inputs to this network. Integrated activity between the ventromedial, dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamic areas ultimately is integrated at the paraventricular nucleus that determines a net balance between the feeding promoting central parasympathetic circuitry and the satiety-promoting central sympathetic circuitry."
"Limbic is a Latin term which means border. Like the familiar word “limbo”, it means an intermediate or transitional state, which is a border. In this case, the border is between the neocortex and the subcortical structures ."
"The limbic system includes the hippocampal formation, amygdala, septal nuclei, cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex. These last three cortical areas comprise different portions of the temporal lobe. The term hippocampal formation typically refers to the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus proper , and the subicular cortex."
"A hippocampal formation is located in the temporal lobe of each cerebral cortex, medial to the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. Hippocampus means seahorse in Greek. Each hippocampus looks like a seahorse due to the way it is folded during development."
"The hippocampus is also called cornu ammonis. Ammon was an Egyptian god, near whose temple ammonia or the salt of Ammon was prepared. The hippocampus is also called Ammon’s Horn because the two hippocampi bend around in the form of the horns of a ram."
The fornix is a “C” shaped tract . The fornix begins as the bundle of fibers called the alveus. The alveus is white matter consisting of myelinated afferents and efferents.
"As the fibers of the alveus travel posteriorly, they aggregate medially to form the fimbria of the fornix. Fimbria means fringe and in this case it is the fringe of the hippocampus. The fimbria looks like a thick rubber band."
The fimbria of each hippocampus thickens as it moves posteriorly and eventually splits off from the hippocampus forming the crua or “legs”  of each hippocampus. The two crua come together and form the hippocampal commissure. The hippocampal commissure provides one of two major paths whereby the hippocampi communicate with each other.
"After the hippocampal commissure the single fiber bundle is properly referred to as the fornix. The fornix continues in an arc to the anterior commissure. The anterior commissure is important as a landmark because this is where the fornix splits into three parts and goes to different structures:  The split just before the anterior commissure is called the precommissural fornix and this branch goes to the septal nuclei, the ventral striatum, and the cingulate cortex."
Some fibers from the fornix also pass through the anterior commissure to the contralateral hippocampus. This is the second of the two major paths by which the hippocampi communicate with each other. The split after the anterior commissure is called the postcommissural fornix and this branch goes to the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus and the anterior nuclei of the thalamus.
"It is important to remember that afferents and efferents of the hippocampus are bundled together in the same paths. Thus, by knowing the output paths, for example, you will also know the input paths, or vice versa. Two major pathways into and out of the hippocampus are the fornix and entorhinal cortex ."
"The precommissural branch of the fornix connects to the septal nuclei, preoptic nuclei, ventral striatum, orbital cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The postcommissural branch of the fornix connects to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. The mammillary bodies are destroyed in Korsakoff’s syndrome as the result of alcoholism and thiamine deficiency."
"Patients with Korsakoff’s syndrome have profound difficulty forming new memories. Because the mammillothalamic tract also goes to the anterior thalamic nucleus, the hippocampus can affect the thalamus indirectly as well as directly. The anterior thalamic nuclei in turn connect to the cingulate cortex."
"The cingulate cortex projects back to the entorhinal cortex of parahippocampal gyrus, completing a “great” loop called the Papez circuit. The Papez circuit like many other areas of the limbic system is involved in learning and memory, emotion, and social behavior, and was originally thought  to the anatomical substrate of emotional experience. The amygdala, along with neocortical areas, are now known to be centrally involved in emotional experience."
Its connections to the original Papez circuit are shown in the next figure and the amygdala and emotion are discussed more thoroughly in the next section. The hippocampus has direct connections to the entorhinal cortex  and the amygdala. These structures connect to many other areas of the brain.
"The entorhinal cortex projects to the cingulate cortex. Therefore, the hippocampus can affect the cingulate cortex through the anterior thalamic nucleus or the entorhinal cortex. The cingulate cortex, in turn, projects to the temporal lobe cortex, orbital cortex, and olfactory bulb."
"Thus, all of these areas can be influenced by the hippocampus. The input paths are just the reverse of the output paths. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of inputs to the hippocampus."
"In addition, the cingulate cortex, temporal lobe cortex, amygdala, orbital cortex, and olfactory bulb all have inputs to the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. The hippocampus receives inputs via the precommissural branch of the fornix from the nucleus basalis of Meynert, which is a portion of the substantia innominata and which in turn is a portion of the septal nuclei. Also the hippocampus receives inputs via the postcommissural branch of the fornix inputs from the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus."
"The hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus processes information that passes through the hippocampus. These two structures, the hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus, form two interlocking “Cs. ” The term dentate gyrus comes from the beaded or toothed appearance of this structure resulting from the many small blood vessels from subarachnoid space that penetrate the dentate gyrus."
"The hippocampus and dentate gyrus are actually cortex, but it is 3-layered cortex rather than 6-layered cortex as in the neocortex. Because of the smaller number of layers and their location between the neocortex and diencephalon, these cortices have been called paleocortex, which means old cortex or archicortex which means ancient cortex. These terms are misleading because they give the false impression that these cortices are antiquated remnants left over as the brain evolved and became more complex."
"They are brain regions that have actually continued to develop structurally and functionally throughout phylogeny. The hippocampus and dentate gyrus, like the neocortex, have a superficial molecular layer and a deep polymorphic layer. But because these structures are ""inside-out"" cortex, the molecular layer is on the inside and the polymorphic layer is on the outside."
The middle layer of the hippocampus proper is a pyramidal cell layer. The middle layer of the dentate gyrus is a granular layer. The molecular layer of the hippocampus proper faces the dentate gyrus.
The area of the hippocampus proper that is capped by the dentate gyrus is referred to as CA3 . The polymorphic layer is the alveus and is equivalent to the white matter of the neocortex. The subiculum is the transition layer from the hippocampus to the parahippocampal gyrus and changes gradually from three to six layers.
The hippocampus coordinates information from a variety of sources. A major flow of information through the hippocampus is a one-way circuit. Some inputs to the hippocampus  from the entorhinal cortex pass through to the dentate gyrus.
"From the dentate gyrus connections are made to CA3 of the hippocampus proper via mossy fibers and to CA1 via Schaffer collaterals. From these two CA fields information then passes through the subiculum entering the alveus, fimbria, and fornix and then to other areas of the brain. Information flows into and through the hippocampus by three principal pathways: 1."
the perforant pathway from the entorhinal cortex to granule cells of the dentate gyrus; 2. the mossy fiber pathway from the granule cell of the dentate gyrus to the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region of the hippocampus; and 3. the Schaffer collateral pathway from the CA3 region of the hippocampus to the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
Identification of an epileptic seizure can be made through EEG  recordings. The EEG records from hundreds of thousands of neurons from scalp electrodes. A few electrodes are placed on the scalp.
"Voltage differences are recorded relative to a reference electrode some distance from the site. The pyramidal cells of the middle layer of the hippocampus proper are the major input of the EEG recording. The pyramidal cells have specialized structures for input called dendritic spines, little spines that are attached to the dendritic shafts."
The pyramidal cells are glutamate excitatory neurons and are the major neurons that project to the cerebral cortex and are the major driving force of temporal lobe epilepsy. The dendrites are parallel to one another resulting in summation of extracellular current flow and hyper-excitability seen in epilepsy. The pyramidal dendrites are perpendicular to the cortical surface resulting in different layers of cortex impinging at different points along the dendritic tree.
The pyramidal dendrites contain dendritic spines that amplify currents  so that distant synaptic sites can more easily generate action potentials. The pyramidal cells  receive inputs from basket cells that regulate excitability of the pyramidal cells through recurrent inhibition. Pyramidal cells would be in a continuous bursting firing mode if there were no basket cells.
"The diagram shows a cartoon pyramidal cell, axon, excitatory collateral to basket cell, basket cell, and inhibitory connection to pyramidal cell. This simple circuit is what is called recurrent inhibition. This is a general feature of nervous system, a collateral to a special cell—the basket cell."
"The pyramidal cell excites the basket cell. Excitation of the basket cell in turn produces negative feedback or inhibition of the pyramidal cell. That is, action of the pyramidal cell acts through the basket cell to regulate its own activity."
"The neurotransmitter of the basket cell is GABA or gamma-aminobutyric acid, typical of most inhibitory neurons. Epilepsy is a synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells. This synchronous discharge produces stereotyped and involuntary jerking movements, loss of awareness, and in the most extreme case convulsions and loss of consciousness."
"Next to stroke, epilepsy is the most common neurological disease. Possibly as much as 1% of the population is affected at one time or the other. Focal or partial epilepsy is restricted to a particular brain region."
But an epileptic attack can begin as a focal attack and spread to other cortical areas and become a generalized seizure. For an epileptic seizure hundreds of thousands of neurons must be firing in synchrony. The way this happens is a breakdown in postsynaptic inhibition.
"The importance of inhibition and the role of the basket cell can be demonstrated by disabling the connection between the basket cell and the pyramidal cell. Picrotoxin, a GABA antagonist, will disable this junction and results in a cascade of excitation and the synchronous activity of an epileptic seizure. Also, examination of sections through the hippocampus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy has shown a loss of cells in the plexus surrounding pyramidal cells."
"This is where the basket cells are typically found. Thus, there is a loss of the inhibitory input that is normally found there. The brake on the system, that is control of the burst firing of pyramidal cells, has been removed when the basket cells have been removed."
Long-term potentiation  was discovered by efforts to determine how the hippocampus might determine memory. Patient H. M.
had just recently demonstrated that the hippocampus was critical in lying down new memories. Researchers found that neural activity can modify synaptic strength in certain areas of the hippocampus. This modified synaptic strength  may be a storage mechanism for memory.
"For more information on LTP and how it is involved in memory formation, see the chapter on Learning and Memory. Amygdala is the integrative center for emotions, emotional behavior, and motivation. If the brain is turned upside down the end of the structure continuous with the hippocampus is called the uncus."
"If you peel away uncus you will expose the amygdala which abuts the anterior of the hippocampus. Just like with the hippocampus, major pathways communicate bidirectionally and contain both efferent and afferent fibers. As was the case with the hippocampus, fibers carrying inputs to the amygdala are in virtually all cases combined with fibers carrying outputs from the amygdala."
"The amygdala receives inputs from all senses as well as visceral inputs. Since the amygdala is very important in emotional learning it is not surprising that visceral inputs are a major input source. Visceral inputs come from the hypothalamus, septal area, orbital cortex, and parabrachial nucleus."
"Olfactory sensory information comes from the olfactory bulb. Auditory, visual and somatosensory information comes from the temporal and anterior cingulate cortices. Ventral Amygdalofugal Pathway."
"The term ""fugal"" comes from the word fuge—to drive away—as in fugitive. This pathway continues to the anterior olfactory nucleus, anterior perforated substance, piriform cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum. The ventral striatum includes part of the caudate, putamen, and the nucleus accumbens septi ."
"Projections from the ventral striatum are links in a basal ganglia circuit that are important in stimulus-response associative learning. The ventral amygdalofugal pathway also connects to the hypothalamus and septal nucleus, but the amygdala's major connection to the hypothalamus and septal nucleus is through the stria terminalis. The ventral amygdalofugal pathway is important because it is a link whereby motivation and drives, through the limbic system, can influence responses."
It is also a link whereby responses are learned. In this case this is the link whereby associative learning takes place. That is where responses are associated with appetitive and aversive consequences that is rewards and punishers.
"Three simplifications:  The stria terminalis is similar in form, function, and location as the fornix for the hippocampal pathway. Thus by way of analogy one can say that the stria terminalis is to the amygdala as the fornix is to the hippocampus. Stria is a Latin word that means line, groove, or band."
"Related to the word ""striated"". The stria terminalis connects only to subcortical structures. The stria terminalis overlaps with the ventral amygdalofugal pathway in that it also connects to the septal nuclei and hypothalamus and thus forms a loop."
"More on similarities to the fornix:  Like the fornix, the stria terminalis has precommissural and postcommissural branches in relation to the anterior commissure. The precommissural branch goes to the septal area. This is exactly what the fornix does."
"The postcommissural branch goes to the hypothalamus. This is exactly what the fornix does. Whereas the postcommissural branch of the fornix projects to mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus, the postcommissural branch of the stria terminalis projects to the lateral nucleus and ventral-medial nucleus of the hypothalamus."
"As with the fornix, some fibers enter anterior commissure cross to the contralateral side. Just as in the case of the two hippocampi communicating with each other through the anterior commissure, the two amygdala communicate with each other through the anterior commissure. The stria terminalis also projects to the habenula, which is part of the epithalamus."
"The central nucleus of the amygdala produces autonomic components of emotion  primarily through output pathways to the lateral hypothalamus and brain stem. The central nucleus of the amygdala also produces conscious perception of emotion primarily through the ventral amygdalofugal output pathway to the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of the amygdala causes intense emotion, such as aggression or fear."
Irritative lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy have the effect of stimulating the amygdala. In its extreme form irritative lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy can cause a panic attack. Panic attacks are brief spontaneously recurrent episodes of terror that generate a sense of impending disaster without a clearly identifiable cause.
"PET scans have shown an increase in blood flow to the parahippocampal gyri, beginning with the right parahippocampal gyrus. Similar but attenuated blood flow increases occurs during anxiety attacks. Destructive lesions such as ablation of the amygdala cause an effect opposite to the irritative lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy."
"Destructive lesions of the amygdala cause tameness in animals, and a placid calmness in humans characterized as a flatness of affect. Lesions of the amygdala can occur as a result of Urbach-Wiethe disease where calcium is deposited in the amygdala. If this disease occurs early in life then these patients with bilateral amygdala lesions cannot discriminate emotion in facial expressions, but their ability to identify faces remains."
The anatomical area for face recognition and memory is in the multimodal association area of the inferotemporal cortex. This is a good example of how emotion in one area  is linked with perception in another area  to create an intense emotionally charged memory. Flatness of affect is one of the symptoms of the previously mentioned Kluver-Bucy syndrome where the entire temporal lobes of monkeys were removed.
"Actually,just lesions of the amygdala were shown to be primarily responsible for flatness of affect. This work eventually led to the psychosurgical technique of prefrontal lobotomies. Remember the movie with Jack Nicholson, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest."
” The prefrontal cortex inputs into the amygdala. By severing this input a flatness of affect is produced which was thought to be desirable in schizophrenic patients who were aggressively violent or emotionally agitated. The amygdala combines many different sensory inputs.
Like the hippocampus it combines external and internal stimuli. Every sensory modality has input. These are integrated with somatosensory and visceral inputs—this is where you get your “gut reaction”.
"The link between prefrontal cortex, septal area, hypothalamus, and amygdala likely gives us our gut feelings, those subjective feelings, about what is good and what is bad. It is also where memory and emotions are combined. When the reward is particularly sweet, that behavior and association may last a lifetime."
"Likewise, the trauma and humiliation of punishment may be remembered for a long time too. Another example of emotion being linked to some perceptual experience is fear conditioning. In this example the sensory experience is auditory rather than visual as in the emotion of faces."
"Much of what we know about the amygdala and its role in emotional learning and memory comes from fear conditioning, mostly but not exclusively conducted with animals. This is an example of classical conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning. In the classic experiments conducted by Pavlov just after the turn of the century, a neutral stimulus—a bell—was sounded and after a brief interval food powder—the unconditioned stimulus—was placed in the dog’s mouth."
After a few such pairings the dog would salivate to the sound of the bell. The crucial aspect of classical conditioning is that it is a pairing between two stimuli. No response is required to get the reward.
"In fear conditioning, an organism hears a noise or sees a visual stimulus. A few seconds, later it receives a mild shock. The reactions involve freezing, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and it gets twitchy—startles easily."
Pathways from the thalamus to the amygdala are particularly important in emotional learning. Output pathways from the central nucleus of the amygdala make extensive connections with the brain stem for emotional responses and extensive connections with cortical areas through the nucleus basalis. Cholinergic projections from the nucleus basalis to the cortex are thought to arouse the cortex.
"The following diagram provides additional information on outputs controlled by the amygdala during fear conditioning. Some pathways of fear conditioning have been discovered and this is a hot research topic in neuroscience. If the auditory cortex pathway is lesioned, for example, basic fear conditioning is unaltered, but discrimination is altered."
"In the discrimination procedure one sound is paired with shock and another sound is not paired with shock. The animals had to rely solely on the thalamus and amygdala for learning and they could not learn the discrimination; apparently the two stimuli were indistinguishable. So, the cortex is not needed for simple fear conditioning; instead it allows us to recognize an object by sight or sound— to interpret the environment."
"Thus, pathways from the sensory thalamus provide only a crude perception of the world, but because they involve only one neural link they are fast pathways. Why might FAST be important? We need a quick reaction to potential danger."
"The thalamus—amygdala pathway provides us with this and may also prepare the amygdala to receive more highly processed information from the cortex. On the other hand, pathways from the cortex offer detailed and accurate representations of the environment. Because these pathways have multiple neural links they are slow by comparison."
If for example we see a slender curled shape behind a tree its much better to jump back and later recognize its a garden hose than to fail to quickly jump back if it were a snake. There is plenty of time later to reflect that it was foolish to be startled in our own secure garden where there are no snakes. Fear producing visual stimuli is quickly processed by the thalamus and this information is passed to the amygdala  producing a quick response  to danger.
The thalamus also passes the information to the cortex so that more careful  judgments can be made about the real potential danger. The amygdala is involved in pleasureful emotional learning as well as fearful emotional learning. Consider instrumental learning.
"Unlike classical conditioning where two stimuli are paired, in instrumental conditioning responses are followed by reward and stimulus-response associations are learned. There are thus three events: a stimulus, a response, and a reward. It has become clear that all three pairwise combinations are learned in instrumental conditioning."
"Where the amygdala comes in is that lesions of the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala disrupt the association the stimulus and rewarding attributes of the food. This amygdala memory system serves as an example of memory systems generally. The establishment of memories is a function of the entire network, not any single component."
"The amygdala is involved in a kind of primitive emotional memory, one that is likely preserved by evolution. According to the diagram of memory systems , declarative memory is mediated by the hippocampus and the cortex. But like the cortex, lesions of the hippocampus have little effect on fear conditioning except in discriminating environmental stimuli."
"A study of patients with damage to the amygdala, hippocampus, or both clearly demonstrates the distinctive roles of these two structures in memory. These patients were shown slides of green, blue, yellow, or red colors. After some colors, a loud and frightening horn blast was sounded."
"Autonomic responses were recorded  to determine learning. Amygdala patients did not become conditioned to colors followed by the loud horn. But when asked how many colors were presented and which were followed by the horn, their recall was correct."
"That is, they had explicit memory about the events. On the other hand, hippocampal patients showed learning and conditioning to the colors followed by the horn, but could not recall which they were. That is, they had implicit memory about the events."
Patients with both types of lesions showed no conditioning and had no explicit memory about which colors were followed by the horn. The chapter on Learning and Memory will explain more about explicit memory and the hippocampus. Fear producing visual stimuli is quickly processed by the thalamus and this information is passed to the amygdala  producing a quick response  to danger.
The thalamus also passes the information to the cortex so that more careful  judgments can be made about the real potential danger. The amygdala is involved in pleasureful emotional learning as well as fearful emotional learning. Consider instrumental learning.

"Patients with both types of lesions showed no conditioning and had no explicit memory about which colors were followed by the horn. The chapter on Learning and Memory will explain more about explicit memory and the hippocampus. Psychologists and neuroscientists have divided memory systems into two broad categories, declarative and nondeclarative ."
"The declarative memory system is the system of memory that is perhaps the most familiar. It is the memory system that has a conscious component and it includes the memories of facts and events. A fact like 'Paris is the capital of France', or an event like a prior vacation to Paris."
"Nondeclarative memory, also called implicit memory, includes the types of memory systems that do not have a conscious component but are nevertheless extremely important. They include the memories for skills and habits , a phenomenon called priming, simple forms of associative learning [e. g."
", classical conditioning ], and finally simple forms of nonassociative learning such as habituation and sensitization. Sensitization will be discussed in detail later in the Chapter. Declarative memory is ""knowing what"" and nondeclarative memory is ""knowing how""."
"Everyone is interested in knowing how well they remember so let us take a simple memory test. The test  will present a list of 15 words, then there will be a pause and you will be asked whether you remember some of those words. Sorry, you have to put your pen down for this test and do not read further in the Chapter until you complete the test."
"This memory test called the DRM test after its creators James Deese, Henry Roediger and Kathleen McDermott. It was not meant to be a trick, but to illustrate a very interesting and important feature about memory. We like to think that memory is similar to taking a photograph and placing that photograph into a filing cabinet drawer to be withdrawn later  as the “memory” exactly the way it was placed there originally ."
But memory is more like taking a picture and tearing it up into small pieces and putting the pieces in different drawers. The memory is then recalled by reconstructing the memory from the individual fragments of the memory. The reason so many individuals incorrectly believe that “sweet” was on the list is because there were so many other words on the list that had a sweet connotation.
“Failing” this test is actually not a bad outcome. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease generally do not say that “sweet” was on the list. They cannot make the normal associations involved in the recall of a memory.
"The word list gives insights into memory processing and retrieval, but it is not a really good test of “raw” memory ability because it can be affected by distortions and biases. To avoid these problems, psychologists have developed other memory tests. One is the object recognition test  to test declarative memory."
"This test is also good because, as we will see later, it can even be used on animals. The test involves presenting a subject with two different objects and they are asked to remember those objects. There is a pause and then two objects are shown again, one of which is new and the other having been shown previously."
"Subjects are asked to identify the novel object, and to do so, they need to remember which one was shown previously. A somewhat related test is the object location test in which subjects are asked to remember the location of an object on a two-dimensional surface. Examples of nondeclarative memory, such as associative learning, can be tested by pairing one stimulus with another and later testing whether a subject has learned to make the association between the two stimuli."
"The classical example is the paradigm developed by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, which is now called classical or Pavlovian conditioning. In classical conditioning , a novel or weak stimulus  like a sound is paired with a stimulus like food that generally elicits a reflexive response  such as salivation. After sufficient training with contingent CS-US presentations , the CS is capable of eliciting a response , which often resembles the UR ."
Now let us turn to this issue about where is memory located. There are three basic approaches. Imaging.
"Modern imaging techniques like fMRI  or PET  allows one to “see” areas of the brain that are active during specific brain tasks. If a subject is placed in an fMRI scanner and given a memory test, one can determine what areas of the brain are active, and that activity presumably is related to where in the brain the memory is processed and/or stored. Figure 7,5 illustrates an example of a PET scan of an individual who is performing an object location test."
"The color code is such that the brighter, redder regions indicate increased brain activity. The most active region is the hippocampus. In discussions of memory, the hippocampus is mentioned repeatedly because it is a major part of the brain involved in declarative memory function."
"This illustration clearly indicates that the hippocampus is involved in object location memory. But as we will see soon, it is not where all memories are stored. Brain lesions."
"In this experimental procedure, small parts of the brains of mice or rats are surgically removed or chemically inactivated and the animals are systematically examined to determine whether the lesion affected any memory system. Brain disease and injury. Here scientists take advantage of individuals who have had unfortunate brain injuries, for example, through stroke or through a brain tumor in a specific area of the brain."
"If one finds a memory deficit in the patient, it is likely that the region of the brain that was injured is involved in that memory. A classic study on localization of memory was the result of surgery performed on Henry Molaison, a patient who was only known to the scientific community as “H. M."
” until his death in 2008. H. M.
"is famous in neuroscience literature because his brain provided major insights into the localization of memory function. In the 1950’s, H. M."
"was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, and while there are pharmacologic treatments, in some cases the only treatment is to remove the portion of the brain that is causing the seizures. Consequently, H. M."
"'s hippocampus was removed bilaterally. Figure 7. 6  is an MRI of a normal individual showing the hippocampal region, whereas Figure 7."
6  shows a MRI of patient H. M. after the removal of the hippocampus.
"Before the operation, H,M, had a fine memory, but after the operation, H. M. had a very severe memory deficit."
"Specifically, after the operation H. M. 's ability to form any new memories for facts and events was severely impaired; he had great difficulty learning any new vocabulary words; he could not remember what happened the day before."
"So if H. M. had an interview the day following a previous interview, he would have little or no memory about the interview or events during it."
This study clearly indicated that the hippocampus was critical for memory formation. But whereas H. M.
"had great difficulty forming new memories for facts and events, he still had all of his old memories for facts and events. Specifically, he had all his childhood memories, and all of his memories prior to the operation. This type of memory deficit is called anterograde amnesia."
"The studies on H. M. clearly indicated that whereas the hippocampus is critical for the formation of new memories, it is not where the old memories are stored."
"It is now known that those old memories are stored in other parts of the brain, such as in the frontal cortex. The process by which an initially labile memory is transformed into a more enduring form is called consolidation. This process involves the memory being stored in a different part of the brain than the initial site of its encoding."
"H,M, was also interesting in that while his ability to form new memories for facts and events was severely impaired, he could form new memories for skills and habits. While he could form new memories for skills and habits,  he did not know that he had the skills!  He had no awareness of the memory; he couldn’t declare that he had it. This finding clearly indicated that the memory for skills and habits are not formed in the hippocampus."
"Collectively, we learned from these studies on H. M. and other patients that memory is distributed throughout the nervous system, and different brain regions are involved in mediating different types of memory."
"Figure 7,7 summarizes many decades of research on the anatomical locus of memory systems. The medial temporal lobe and structures like the hippocampus are involved with memories for facts and events; the striatum is involved with memories for skills and habits; the neocortex is involved with priming; the amygdala is involved with emotional memories; and the cerebellum with simple forms of associative learning. Lower brain regions and the spinal cord contain even simpler forms of learning."
"In summary, memory is not stored in a single place in the brain. It is distributed in different parts of the brain. Much of what has been learned about the neural and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory have come from the use of so called “model systems” that are amenable to cellular analyses."
One of those model systems is illustrated in Figure 7. 8A. Aplysia californica is found in the tidal pools along the coast of Southern California.
"It is about six inches long and weighs about 150 grams. At first glance it is an unpromising looking creature, but neuroscientists have exploited the technical advantages of this animal to gain fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of memory. Indeed, the pioneering discoveries of Eric Kandel using this animal were recognized by his receipt of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000."
"Aplysia have three technical advantages. First, it exhibits simple forms of nondeclarative  learning like classical  conditioning, operant conditioning and sensitization. Second, Aplysia have a very simple nervous system."
"Compared to the 100’s of billions of nerve cells in the human brain, the entire nervous system of this animal only has about 10,000 cells. Those cells are distributed in different ganglia like the one illustrated in Figure 7. 8B."
"Each ganglia like this one  has only about 2,000 cells, yet it is capable of mediating or controlling a number of different behaviors. This means that any one behavior can be controlled by 100 neurons or even less. One has the potential of working out the complete neural circuit underlying a behavior, and then, after training the animal, the neural circuit can be examined to identify what has changed in the circuit that underlies the memory."
"Third, the ganglia contain neurons that are very large. Figure 7. 8B shows a ganglion under a dissecting microscope."
It is about 2mm in diameter. The spherical structures throughout the ganglia are the cell bodies of individual neurons. Each neuron is identifiable and has a unique localization and function.
"A related advantage is that individual neurons can be removed and placed in culture medium where they can survive for many days. Indeed, multiple neurons can be removed from the ganglia and they reestablish their normal synaptic connections, thereby providing a very powerful experimental system to study the physiology of nerve cells and the properties of the connections between them. Figure 7."
"8C shows an example of a sensory neuron  and a motor neuron  in culture. In the micrograph it is possible to see the shadow of a microelectrode that has impaled the sensory neuron, and the shadow of a microelectrode that has impaled a motor neuron for performing intracellular recordings. Figures 7,9 and 7,10 illustrate a simple behavior exhibited by the animal and a simple form of learning called sensitization."
"The animal is tested by stimulating its tail with a weak electric shock  or a weak mechanical tap . These stimuli elicit defensive reflex withdrawals of the body, which includes the tail and nearby sites such as the gill and a fleshy spout called the siphon. In response to test stimuli delivered every five minutes, the withdrawals are fairly reliable."
"They are about the same duration each time . But if a strong noxious stimulus  is delivered to another part of the animal such as its body wall, subsequent test stimuli to the tail give enhanced responses . This is an example of a simple form of learning called sensitization."
"It is defined as the enhancement of the response to a test stimulus as a result of delivering a strong generally noxious stimulus to the animal. In a sense, the animal is learning that it is in a “fearful” environment. Sensitization is a ubiquitous form of learning that is exhibited by all animals including humans."
"Neural circuit. We can take advantage of the large nerve cells of Aplysia, and the ability to make intracellular recordings from them, to work out the underlying neural circuit. Figure 7."
"11 illustrates a simplified view of the key components of the underlying neural circuit. Stimulation of the skin activates sensory neurons   which make glutamatergic excitatory synaptic connections  with motor neurons . If the summated synaptic input to the motor neurons is sufficiently large, the motor neurons will be activated and action potentials will propagate out of the ganglion to cause an eventual contraction of the muscle."
"So stimulation of the skin excites sensory neurons, the sensory neurons activate motor neurons, and motor neurons contract the muscles. Also, it should be evident that the greater the activation of the motor neurons, the greater will be the subsequent reflex response. This reflex in Aplysia is similar to the knee jerk or stretch reflex mediated by similar circuitry in the vertebrate spinal cord."
Mechanisms of sensitization. Sensitizing stimuli lead to the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin  . 5-HT modulates the strength of the connection between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron.
"An action potential in the sensory neuron before the learning produces a small excitatory postsynaptic potential  in the motor neuron . But, after delivering the sensitizing stimulus, an action potential in the sensory neuron leads to a larger synaptic potential in the motor neuron . A larger synaptic potential in the motor neuron increases the probability that the motor neuron will be activated to a greater extent and produce a larger contraction of the muscle ."
"One principle about learning and memory derived from studies of this simple animal, and this principle holds true in our brains as well, is that learning involves changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Learning is not due to a reorganization of the nervous system or the growth of new neurons. What has changed is that the strength of a previously existing connection is modified."
Now we can take this analysis one step further and ask what are the biochemical mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. We will divide the discussion into two temporal domains of memory; short-term memory and long-term memory. We have already discussed different types of memory such as declarative and nondeclarative memory.
"There are also different temporal domains of memory. Short-term memories are like the memory for a telephone number that last several minutes, and long-term memory are memories that last days, weeks or a lifetime. Mechanisms of short-term sensitization."
The mechanisms for the short-term memory for sensitization are illustrated in Figure 7. 12B. The sensitizing stimulus leads to release of the neurotransmitter 5-HT.
"5-HT binds the two types of receptors on the sensory neuron; one is coupled to the DAG/PKC system, and the other is coupled to the cyclic AMP/PKA system. These are the same general cascades that you learned in biochemistry. Learning mechanisms have evolved to co-opt some of the biochemical machinery that are already present in all cells used them specifically for a memory mechanism in nerve cells."
"The protein kinases exert two types of actions. First, they regulate the properties of different membrane channels  represent membrane channels that underlie the initiation and the repolarization of the action potential). Consequently after a sensitizing stimulus, the amount of calcium that enters the synaptic terminal during an action potential and causes the release of transmitter will be enhanced."
"In addition, the modulation of the membrane channels leads to an increase in the excitability of the sensory neuron and as a result a greater number of action potentials will be elicited by a test stimulus to the skin. Second, the kinases regulate other cellular processes involved in transmitter release, such as the size of the pool of synaptic vesicles available for release in response to the influx of Ca2+ with each action potential. Finally, 5-HT leads to changes in the properties of the postsynaptic motor neuron."
"Specifically, 5-HT leads to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors. The consequences of these processes can be seen by comparing the strength of the synaptic connection produced by a single action potential before  and after  sensitization. The specific details of all the currents and processes are not critical."
"However, it is important to know the general principles. One principle is that learning involves the engagement of second messenger systems. Here both the protein kinase C  and the protein kinase A  systems are involved."
"This is a fairly general principle. In every example of learning that has ever been examined, whether vertebrate or invertebrate, second messenger systems are engaged. A second principle is that memory involves the modulation of neuronal membrane channels."
"These can include channels that directly regulate transmitter release , channels that regulate neuronal excitability, and channels that mediate synaptic responses in the postsynaptic neuron. A third principle is that cyclic AMP is one of the critical second messengers that is involved in memory. Given this information, you can begin to think about how memory could be improved based on your knowledge of the underlying biochemistry."
"We have discussed a mechanism for a short-term memory. It is ""short-term"" because the memory is transient and that is so because the underlying biochemical changes are transient. The duration of the memory is dependent on how long the various substrate proteins  are phosphorylated."
PKA will only be activated for a short time after a brief stimulus because cyclic AMP will be degraded and PKA levels will decrease. Protein phosphatases will remove the phosphate groups on the substrate proteins that are “storing” the memory. Mechanisms of long-term sensitization.
"There are two major differences between short-term and long-term memories. Long-term memories involve changes in protein synthesis and gene regulation, whereas short-term memories do not. And, long-term memories in many cases involve structural modifications."
"Figure 7. 13 illustrates examples of the processes of two sensory neurons that have been filled with a dye, one from an untrained animal and one from a trained animal. Shown are the thick axonal process of the neuron and many fine branches."
Along the branches are seen small dot-like swellings or varicosities. These varicosities are the presynaptic terminals of the sensory neurons that make contact with other neurons like the motor neurons. Part B of Figure 7.
"13 shows an example of a sensory neuron that has been injected with a dye in an untrained animal, and Part A shows one that has been filled with a dye 24 h after sensitization training. There is a major difference between these two neurons. The neuron from the trained animal has a greater number of branches and a greater number of synaptic varicosities than the neuron from the untrained animal."
"Therefore, long-term memory involves changes in the structure of neurons including growth of new processes and synapses. So, to the extent that you remember anything about this material on memory tomorrow, or next week, or next year, it will be because structural changes in synapses are beginning in your brains! Given that long term memory involves changes in gene expression, a major goal of neuroscientists is to identify the specific genes and proteins that are involved in long-term memory. Figure 7."
"14 illustrates some of the genes and the proteins that are involved in long-term sensitization. Note that cAMP, one of the second messengers involved in the short-term memory, is also involved in the induction of long-term memory. But now, in addition to its effects on the phosphorylation of membrane channels, cAMP, through PKA, phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB ."
"Transcription factors like CREB, when phosphorylated, are capable of regulating gene expression, which leads to changes in the expression of proteins that are important for inducing and maintaining the long-term changes in synaptic strength and therefore the long term memory. Note that there is not a single “magic memory gene” – rather, the induction and maintenance of memory, even in a single neuron, involves the engagement of multiple genes and proteins that act synergistically to change the properties of the neurons and regulate the properties of the neuron and the strength of the synapse. Also note that changes in gene expression do not occur all at once – there are different phases."
"Some changes in gene expression occur early, some even 24 hours after the learning occurs. An enduring form of synaptic plasticity called long-term potentiation  is believed to be involved in many examples of declarative memory. It is present in the hippocampus, which is known to be involved in declarative memories."
"LTP can be studied in brain slice preparations where an electric shock  can be delivered to afferent fibers and the resultant summated EPSP can be recorded in the postsynaptic neuron . If the pathway is repeatedly stimulated , the amplitude of EPSP is constant . Delivering a brief 1-sec duration train of high frequency  stimuli  to the afferent nerve produces two types of enhancement in the postsynaptic neuron."
"First, there is a transient facilitation called post-tetanic potentiation  that dies away after several minutes. Second, following the PTP is a very enduring enhancement of the EPSP called LTP. LTP is the kind of mechanism necessary to store a long-term memory ."
"The NMDA-type glutamate receptor is critical for some forms of LTP, in particular LTP at the CA3-CA1 synapse in the hippocampus. The postsynaptic spines of CA1 neurons have two types of glutamate receptors; NMDA-type glutamate receptors and AMPA-type glutamate receptors . Both receptors are permeable to Na+ and K+, but the NMDA-type has two additional features."
"First, in addition to being permeable to Na+, it also has a significant permeability to Ca2+. Second, this channel is normally blocked by Mg2+. Even if glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor and produces a conformational change, there is no efflux of K+ or influx of Na+ and Ca2+ because the channel is ""plugged up"" or blocked by the Mg2+."
"Thus, a weak test stimulus will not open this channel because it is blocked by Mg2+. A weak test stimulus will produce an EPSP, but that EPSP will be mediated by the AMPA receptor. It is as if the NMDA receptor were not even there."
"Now consider the consequences of delivering a tetanus . During the tetanus, there will be spatial and temporal summation of the EPSPs produced by the multiple afferent synapses on the common postsynaptic cell . Consequently, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron will be depolarized significantly, much more so than the depolarization produced by a single afferent test stimulus."
"Because the inside of the cell becomes positive with the large synaptic input, the positively charged Mg2+ is repelled by the inside positivity and is ""thrust"" out of the channel. Now the channel is unplugged and Ca2+ can enter the spine through the unblocked NMDA receptor. The Ca2+ that enters the cell activates various protein kinases, which then trigger long-term changes."
"One component of the long-term change is the insertion of new AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane . Therefore, after the tetanus, the transmitter released from the presynaptic neuron by a test stimulus will bind to a greater number of receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. If more receptors are bound and hence opened, a larger  EPSP  will be produced ."
"In addition to an increase in the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, there is evidence that a greater amount of transmitter is released from the presynaptic neurons. The combination of the presynaptic and postsynaptic effects would act synergistically to increase the size of the synaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Note that this example of a synaptic mechanism for declarative memory bears some similarity to the synaptic mechanism for the example of nondeclarative memory  discussed previously."
"Although the specific details differ, both involve activation of second messenger systems and regulation of membrane channels. Therefore, at a fundamental mechanistic level, there does not appear to be significant differences between the two major classes of memory systems. The major difference appears to be the brain region and the neural circuit and into which the learning mechanism is embedded."
"With a knowledge of some of the genes and proteins involved in memory, we can use this information to try to both test the role of specific proteins in memory and also to improve memory. One experimental way of approaching the issue is to use transgenic technology in which a gene of interest can be over expressed in an animal by introducing it into an egg cell. When the offspring develop into adults, their performance on memory tests can be examined."
"An example of this approach is illustrated in Figure 7. 17. Here the role of the NMDA receptor was examined by Joe Tsien and his colleagues, who were then at Princeton University."
"If NMDA receptors are important for the induction of LTP, and LTP is important for declarative memory, one would expect that animals that had a greater number of NMDA receptors would learn more readily. NMDA receptors were over expressed in mice and the mice were tested on the object discrimination test that was discussed earlier in the Chapter. To assess the performance of a mouse on the object recognition task, the experimenter measures the amount of time for some predefined period the mouse spends exploring the one object, versus the amount of time the mouse spends exploring the other object."
"If the mouse remembers that it had seen one of the objects previously, it will spend more time exploring the novel one. As illustrated in Figure 7. 17, one hour after the initial presentation of the objects, the mice do very well on the test."
"Indeed, they are correct about 100% of the time. They know the novel object. However, one day later the memory performance is rather poor, and after three days it is even worse."
"By one week, mice show no recognition memory. What about the mice that received the extra NMDA receptors? Now one day after training they have perfect memory!  So the extra receptors have led to an improved memory performance."
"That’s the good news – but the bad news is that the memory is no better one week later. This somewhat disappointing finding should not be surprising. Although NMDA receptors are important in memory, they are not the whole story."
"As indicated earlier in the Chapter, memory involves the synergistic engagement of multiple genes and proteins. So to improve memory further, it will be necessary to manipulate multiple genes. At the present time it is difficult to do so, but, it probably will become possible in the near future."
It will also be possible to over express genes of interest in targeted areas of the human brain. The future for treating individuals with memory disabilities looks very promising. A major issue of the topic of higher cortical function is the degree to which mental and cognitive functions are located in specific brain regions.
"We begin by looking at the neuroscience of language. Language is one of the most elaborate cognitive behaviors. The pioneer of brain localization of language function was a French neurologist, Pierre Paul Broca, working around the time of our civil war—1861."
"Broca extended a theory proposed by Gall  that the cortex was divided into 35 or more regions for attributes such as hope, generosity, and secretiveness. According to Gall, these were cortical “organs. ” They grew with use, much as muscles did with exercise, and caused bumps and ridges on the skull."
"Thus, was born the science of phrenology. Hundreds and thousands of skulls were collected and bumps were correlated to attributes and personalities of those individuals. From a study of these correlations, so-called experts would go out into the population and “read” the bumps of living people to divine their attributes and personalities—all for a fee, of course."
Broca’s work differed from Gall’s. Broca argued for examining brains of people with clinical disorders for lesions that might then indicate the brain region responsible for the disorder. Thus was born the field of neuropsychology which flourishes today and has provided much of what we know about localized function in the brain.
"In 1861, Broca described a patient named Leborgne who could understand language but could not speak. He had no motor deficits to account for his inability to speak. He could whistle, utter isolated words, and sing the lyrics of a melody."
"Postmortem examination of Leborgne’s brain showed a lesion in the posterior region of the frontal lobe. This region is now called Broca’s area. A few years later, in 1876, Karl Wernicke described another type of aphasia."
"This aphasia, or language disorder, involved a failure to comprehend language rather than a failure to speak. Broca’s patient could understand language but not speak, whereas Wernicke’s patient could speak but not understand language. Location of the lesion in Wernicke’s patient was different from Broca’s patient."
"It was in at the junction of the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes—now called Wernicke’s area. The junction of temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes is an important area to remember. Wernicke proposed that language involves separate motor and sensory programs located in different cortical regions."
"The motor program, located in Broca’s area was suitably situated in front of the motor area that controls the mouth, tongue, and vocal cords. The sensory program, located in Wernicke’s area, was suitably surrounded by the posterior association cortex that integrates auditory, visual, and somatic sensations. Wernicke’s model is still referred to today."
"According to this model, initial processing of spoken or written words takes place in the primary and unimodal sensory areas for vision and audition. This information is then conveyed to the angular gyrus of the posterior association area. This was thought to be the area where either written or spoken words were transformed into a common neural representation."
"Then, these representations were thought to be transferred to Wernicke’s area where they were recognized as language and associated with meaning. Without meaning, there can be no language comprehension. These neural representations along with their associated meanings are then passed along, via the arcuate fasiculus, to Broca’s area where it is transformed into a motor representation that allows for speech."
"From the Wernicke model, Wernicke correctly predicted a third type of aphasia—conduction aphasia. Comprehension and speech articulation are spared but these two areas were thought to be disconnected. Patients can comprehend and speak, but they omit parts of words and substitute incorrect sounds."
"They are aware of their errors but are unable to correct them. More recent results, such as those from functional imaging, have shown that the Wernicke model is an over simplification. There are, as we will see, other brain areas responsible for different aspects of language."
We will briefly consider different aspects that constitute language before considering brain areas that control these different language aspects. Language is communication through words or symbols for words. Words are an association between a sound and meaning.
"By 6 years of age children understand about 13,000 words and by the end of high school about 60,000 words. Thus, children connect a new sound to a meaning about every 90 waking minutes. The issue is whether this development is innate or learned, and was most prominently raised as an issue by seminal books published in the late 1950s by Skinner and Chomsky."
"In support of innate development of language, all cultures learn language. Even children together in a social environment but deprived of any developed language—invent their own language. In support of learned language, young children deprived of language  acquire language fully if learning takes place before puberty."
"If after puberty, they are very inept at language. If an infant has its whole left hemisphere removed, it will develop language fully in the right hemisphere. If adults have left hemisphere removed all language skills disappear forever."
"Finally, young children acquire several languages perfectly, whereas later in life it is much more difficult and with telltale signs of accents and grammatical errors. Thus, from the nurture standpoint there appears to be a critical period for language acquisition. From a neurological standpoint the developing brain is plastic with regard to language for several years."
If language is innate then we can ask: When did it evolve? Language may have evolved as long ago as 2 million years ago. One of the things about language is that it is lateralized to an area called Broca’s area in the left hemisphere.
"Even the skulls of Homo habilis, a distant ancestor that lived about 3 million years ago, show an enlargement in the region of Broca’s area of the left hemisphere. If language evolved, should not a common evolutionary ancestor have passed this ability along to apes? Possibly, but on the other hand the division between apes and 6-8 million years ago may have allowed sufficient time for a separate development language in the evolutionary branch leading to man."
"One way to answer this question is to identify language in some other species? We can all think of language-like behavior from our pets. Dogs, for example, understand words like “come”, “dinner”, “fetch”, etc."
"But is this language? Parrots have been taught to “talk. ” One parrot, Alex, can name, request, or refuse more than 100 objects."
"When Alex is shown five keys or five corks and is asked verbally by his trainer, “How many? ”, Alex answers verbally “five. ” He can combine the concepts of number with color and can correctly answer the question, “How many blue key?"
"” Alex knows the concept of same and different. When presented with a pair of objects that differ in matter , shape , or color  and asked “What’s different? ” Alex will then “say” the correct answer."
"Alternatively, a blue wooden square and a red wooden triangle might be presented with the question “What’s same? ” and Alex will answer “wood. ” Alex can also be presented with novel shapes, colors, or matter and be highly accurate."
"But, is this language? Finally, some of the great apes  have been taught symbols or tokens to represent objects and actions and others American Sign Language. These are hand signs used by deaf people, related to the hand signs used by the Native American Indian peoples."
In either case they have learned the meaning of several hundred signs or symbols. Is this language? The answer is probably not.
"They learn by rote behavior that if they want to get the treat  that they have to put the prefix “Give me” before making the sign for “apple. ” Apparently, they do not learn the meaning of the phrase “Give me. ” What evidence would be necessary to show that they did learn the meaning?"
"Related is that the word strings of sentences that these apes make do not increase with training as they do with young children. This then brings up the question: If this is not language, then what aspect of language is missing? The answer is grammar."
"If language is communication through words, then the next question is how are these words associated to provide this communication. The answer, of course, is grammar. Grammar is the rules that allow thoughts to be expressed in words and words connected into sentences when speaking and comprehending."
"Language is not how people ought to talk; it is how they do talk. For example, “ain’t” communicates as well as “isn’t. ”  Grammar can be subdivided into morphology, phonology, prosody, and syntax."
"Morphology specifies the rules for combining words into longer words by adding prefixes and suffixes so, for example, the subject and predicate will agree. Phonology specifies the rules for combining sound elements and phonemes into words. The sound elements do not have meaning in themselves, e."
"g. , the letters D-O-G has a different meaning from the reverse G-O-D. Prosody is the pattern of intonation and stress that for example allows us to distinguish questions from statements."
Syntax specifies how words are to be combined into phrases and sentences so that the meaning will be clear. An unclear example would be the line from Animal Crackers by Groucho Marx: “I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I’ll never know.
” Aphasia is a language disorder. Such disorders revealed areas of the brain critical for language. What makes language special in terms of associating its function with specific brain areas is that language is lateralized to the left hemisphere.
If it were represented in both hemispheres then brain damage would be less likely to reveal aphasia because the other undamaged hemisphere would just take over language function. Language is lateralized to the left hemisphere in about 96% of the population. This percentage is somewhat less for left-handed than right-handed people.
"How was lateralization of language discovered? At least four lines of evidence have been important: 1) Neuropsychological studies of patients who suffered stroke, head injuries, herpes encephalitis, and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Pick’s disease; 2) functional imaging studies of normal individuals; 3) electrical stimulation of patients undergoing neurosurgery; 4) split-brain patients. Continued work on the neuropsychology of language disorders from patients with lesions and from stimulation studies of patients’ brains prior and during neurosurgery, has greatly elaborated on the Wernicke model of language."
"For example, Wernicke’s area has been subdivided into different functions. Lesions of the frontal-temporal area produce lexical deficits—problems in understanding meaning. Lesions of the parietal-temporal region produce syntactical deficits—problems in relating words in sentences."
"Implementation system: Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas along with areas of the insular cortex and basal ganglia analyze incoming speech in terms of phonemes and other grammar. Mediational system: Areas of the temporal, parietal, and frontal association cortices that surround the implementation system. The mediational system fosters communication between the implementation system and conceptual system."
"Conceptual system: Areas distributed throughout the association cortices that are important in learning, memory, and conceptual knowledge. These are associative areas considered in the next lecture, Higher Order Cortical Function: Association and Executive Areas. The different language and association areas are not as uniform in function as once thought."
"They have been subdivided, several times in some cases. It becomes awkward and imprecise to refer to these different brain areas in terms of lobes, sulci, and gyri. Many researchers use Brodmann’s numbering scheme."
"Korbinian Brodmann, a German anatomist, was inspired by Broca’s and Wernicke’s discoveries. At the turn of the century, Brodmann used cortical cytoarchitecture, the common appearance of neurons within the cortex, to identify 52 distinct areas. Broca aphasia is damage to the inferior left frontal gyrus, which are Brodmann’s areas 44 and 45 including underlying white matter, insula and basal ganglia."
"In many casual conversations, Broca aphasics appear normal in comprehension. Their speech, however, is obviously impaired. Speech is slow."
"Articulation is impaired and melodic intonation  is lacking. The difficulty is not so much in pronunciation of individual sounds as in transitions from one sound to another sound. Thus, there is not a smooth articulation of flowing speech."
"In severe cases, perseveration of motor elements may be so great as to prevent pronunciation of simple words. For example, a Broca aphasic might say “2…2…2…2…want to…to…to…go…go…go…home. ”  So far, this is according to the Wernicke model."
"But the normal comprehension is largely an illusion. Since most communication is with simple sentences, Broca aphasics make sense out of a sentence from only a few key words. If Broca aphasics are given the sentence: “The apple that the boy is eating is red."
” They can understand it. Boys eat apples. Apples do not eat boys.
"Apples are red. Boys are not red. One can, however, show that comprehension is not normal by their inability to understand the sentence: “The boy that the girl is chasing is tall”."
"They have difficulty understanding this sentence because either boys or girls can be tall and because boys can chase girls or girls can chase boys. To understand the sentence you have to understand the phrase “that the girl is chasing” to identify whom is chasing and who is tall. This is a grammar deficit, but grammar is by no means totally absent."
The Broca aphasic is apparently able to detect that “John was finally kissed Louise” is ungrammatical because a passive verb  is followed by a direct object. The actual problem that Broca aphasics have is thought to be a memory problem. Linking two elements in a sentence requires keeping the first element in memory.
"As the gap between elements to be linked becomes longer, these patients have more trouble. Functional imaging results tend to support this interpretation that Broca aphasics have a short-term memory problem. A subregion of Broca’s area in normal subjects is more strongly activated  when the gap between elements to be linked is long rather than short."
"Some activity is apparently going on in this subregion to keep the elements in memory so that they can be linked. Wernicke aphasia is damage primarily to Brodmann’s area 22 at the junction of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. This is the left auditory association cortex."
"Speech is fluent, effortless, and melodic, unlike Broca aphasia. The content, however, is often jumbled. A Wernicke aphasic might say: “Aah dar, the spoon was needed for the telephone."
” Even phonemes of individual words can become jumbled. In such cases the words are unintelligible—and are called neologisms. Such a patient might say: “Aoh confondo…noconfulo.
. . he indent the confondo.
"” Wernicke patients have difficulty in word retrieval, and cannot select words that represent what they intend to say—this is called semantic paraphasia. They may say “headman” for “president. ” They also have difficulty comprehending speech of others."
"It is useful to think of Wernicke’s area as a brain comprehension center, but as we saw with Broca aphasia there was a loss of comprehension there too. Deaf people who sign with American Sign Language  use these same areas of the brain in the same way as those who speak language. Lesions in Wernicke area of deaf people loose ability to comprehend sign ."
Those with lesions in Broca’s area lose the ability to make signs. Conduction aphasia is caused primarily by damage to Brodmann’s areas 39 and 40. Speech production and comprehension are less affected than in Broca or Wernicke aphasias.
They cannot repeat sentences accurately. And they have trouble naming pictures and objects. We will say more about these anomies in the next section.
"Conduction aphasia is not produced by disconnection of the arcuate fasiculus alone as Wernicke thought. Damage producing conduction aphasia, however, does destroy many interconnections among the temporal, parietal, insular and frontal cortices that are responsible for assembling phonemes into words. Transcortical aphasia can manifest itself as transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia."
The name transcortical comes from damage to pathways in addition to damage of language areas. The pathways that are damaged are those that connect language areas to other parts of the brain. A way to remember these transcortical aphasias is that the relation between transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia is similar to the relation between Broca aphasia and Wernicke aphasia in terms of articulation vs.
"comprehension, respectively. Transcortical motor aphasia is a disconnection of the language areas from areas that initiate and control speech. For example, these patients have trouble saying “kick” in response to “ball”, even though they use these same words correctly in ordinary speech."
"They can, however, repeat even very long sentences. Transcortical motor aphasia is caused by damage to the left dorsolateral frontal area. This is an area anterior and superior to Broca’s area."
"Transcortical sensory aphasics have fluent speech with impaired comprehension—very much like Wernicke aphasics. But unlike Wernicke aphasics, they can repeat sentences accurately. Transcortical sensory aphasia is caused by damage to in the area of the junction of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes."
"Like the term implies—it’s everything. Global aphasics have all of the disabilities of Broca, Wernicke, and Conduction combined. They cannot comprehend, repeat sentences, or speak meaningfully."
"They do, however, speak in expletives, and can recite such things as the days of the week. Global aphasia is caused by damage to anterior language region, basal ganglia and insula , posterior language region  and superior temporal gyrus . Typically, this large amount of damage is caused by infarct in the middle cerebral artery."
"Below are some simulated examples of the capacity for spontaneous speech, comprehension, and repetition in aphasics. Dysarthria is the inability to control muscles of articulation and produces speech that is weak, flaccid and systematically distorted. Apraxia is a deficit in planning the desired speech movements and produces errors phonemically similar to the target word, for example saying “yawyer” for “lawyer” or “cookun” for “cushion”."
"Apraxia nearly always occurs in Broca’s aphasia and accounts for the slow effortful style characteristic of Broca’s aphasics. But recent evidence indicates that not all apraxia patients are Broca aphasics. There are, for example, patients who have apraxia but not Broca aphasia and these patients all have lesions of the insula  located at the superior tip of the precentral gyrus."
"Specialization of language in the brain may be best shown by different areas of the brain that are active when naming different kinds of objects. For example, the naming of animals is apparently located in the medial occipital cortex whereas naming of tools appears to be in the left middle temporal gyrus. Some patients cannot place the appropriate stress, timing or intonation on words in their sentences."
This condition is called prosody. The right hemisphere controls prosody. It has an organization that roughly parallels the arrangement of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas of the left hemisphere.
The right inferior frontal gyrus is the site for articulating or producing prosody. The right posterior temporoparietal region is the site for comprehending prosody. The sentence “Bill is here.
"” has stress on the first word, whereas the sentence “Bill is here? ” has stress on the last word. A schoolteacher, for example, with a developing prosody deficit began to have difficulty controlling students in her class."
"She had feelings of anger when the students misbehaved and desire to assert her authority in order to reestablish control, but she could not convey these feelings because she could not place appropriate stress on her speech. Some patients with prosody deficits cannot comprehend emotional tone or prosody of others that are speaking. These patients don’t understand jokes and have difficulty relating to people in social gatherings."
Alexia is the inability to read and agraphia is the inability to write. These inabilities may be present individually or together and combined with aphasia. Vision is bilateral in the occipital lobes.
Alexia results from disruption of visual input from both hemispheres to the language areas of the left hemisphere. PET functional imaging studies show that reading activates an area in the left hemisphere that is just anterior to the visual cortex. This may be the critical area that when damaged results in alexia.
Dyslexia is a reading disorder. It is often referred to as developmental dyslexia. Estimates of the population that it effects range from 10 to 30%.
"Its cause is not known for sure, and there may be multiple causes. One possibility is that, like alexia, there may be abnormalities in connections between visual and language areas. Another possibility is that there might be a deficit in hemispheric specialization."
"In dyslexic males, unlike normal males, the left planum temporale is not larger that the right one. There is incomplete segregation of cell layers. There are clusters of neurons that appear to be inappropriately connected."
Maybe the migration of neurons to the left temporal cortex during development was slowed or somehow disrupted. Another possibility is that conduction velocity in the magnocellular pathway of the visual system is slowed. The cells in this pathway are abnormally small.
"Dyslexic patients have trouble processing fast, high-contrast stimuli, like words. Higher-order integrative cortical areas, called association areas, intervene between the sensory inputs and motor outputs. Hierarchical organization of the cortex was proposed in the 1870s by the famous British neurologist, John Hughlings Jackson."
"These association areas are the site of cognitive processing and are the focal areas in the rapidly developing field of cognitive neuroscience. Three multimodal association areas will be discussed in conjunction with three unimodal association areas and three primary sensory areas. Limbic association area Located in the anterior-ventral portion of the temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus."
"Links emotion with many sensory inputs. Important in learning and memory. Posterior association area Located at the junction of occipital, temporal and parietal lobes."
Links information from primary and unimodal sensory areas Important in perception and language. Anterior association area Located in the prefrontal cortex. Links information from other association areas.
"Important in memory, planning, and higher-order concept formation. Three unimodal association areas are located adjacent to their respective primary sensory cortical areas as shown in the figure. The general principle to be learned here is that as one gets further away from the primary sensory areas the associative functions become more general."
"Sensory information is processed and sent from receptors along parallel pathways through primary sensory cortex and unimodal association cortex to the posterior multimodal association cortex of each hemisphere—the posterior parietal and temporal cortices. The posterior multimodal association cortex is highly connected to the anterior association areas which in turn are responsible for conceptual cognitive functions and planning motor actions. After planning motor actions in the anterior association area, the actual processing of the motor response output is the reverse of processing in the sensory  system."
"The premotor cortex is rostral to the motor cortex—Brodmann’s areas 6 and 8. Retrieval of information that has been learned apparently is also a reverse of the paths and structures used in storing this information. Damage to posterior association areas also sometimes including parts of the unimodal association areas can result in agnosia, a Greek word meaning “not knowing."
"” Lesions of the visual posterior association area can result in the inability to recognize familiar faces or learn new faces while at the same time leave other aspects of visual recognition intact—a deficit called prosopagnosia. These patients can identify a face as a face, its parts, and specific emotions from facial expressions, but they cannot identify a face as a particular person. They often cannot recognize relatives such as parents or children and in some instances cannot recognize their own face."
"They have not lost knowledge about their close relatives and friends because they use sound of the voice and other cues to recognize them. Lesions causing prosopagnosia are always bilateral on the inferior surface of both occipital lobes and extend forward to the inner surface of the temporal lobes. Patients with lesions in the posterior multimodal association cortex  can perceive and draw objects, but they cannot name them—a deficit called associative agnosia."
"They haven’t forgotten the names of these objects because they can correctly name them by touch. Other damage to the occipital lobes and surrounding region can render patients unable to draw objects, but remarkably can still name them—a deficit called apperceptive agnosia. There are other cases where lesions in similar areas of the right and left hemisphere produce almost complementary perceptual differences."
"Right hemisphere damage disrupts perception of global objects, while left hemisphere damage disrupts percept of local objects. This is found only in acute stages immediately after a stroke and only with lesions centered in the temporal-parietal junction . Agnosias of right posterior parietal visuocortex are some of the most remarkable."
The multimodal posterior association area receives inputs from the visual and auditory systems and from the hippocampus. They result from an inability to perceive objects despite normally functioning sensory systems. These patients ignore things on the left including the left halves of objects and the left half of their own body.
"This is called contralateral neglect syndrome. Contralateral neglect is a deficit in the self-image on the left side of their body and a deficit in perceiving the world on the left side. Typically, patients suffering from contralateral neglect syndrome will have paralysis on their left side."
Some patients will not wash or dress their left side—personal neglect syndrome. This neglect may extend to disowning the left side of their body. They will make remarks such as “Who put this arm in my bed” when referring to their left arm.
"The neglect can extend from their personal space to the world around them. They may draw a flower, for example, with the petals only on the right-hand side, or clock numbers only on the right-hand side, etc. A little thought will convince you that it is not a sensory problem."
Not just the right half of all objects in the environment have input into such a patients sensory system. Most objects are made up of multiple parts. You can think of these parts as objects.
"So for example, each petal of the flower is an object. They don’t “see” just the right half of each petal. This is the infinite regress problem."
"To show you how complicated and complex this visual neglect problem can become there was a study of a group of visual-neglect patients in Milan, Italy. They were asked in the hospital examining room to imagine the well-known public square, the Piazza del Duomo. They were told that they should imagine that they were facing the cathedral."
"They were then asked to recall all of the buildings on the square. They recalled only the buildings on their  right. Then they were told that they were standing on the steps of the cathedral, and imagine that they were facing in the opposite direction."
"Once again, they were asked to recall all of the buildings on the square. What they did was to recall all of the buildings that they had failed to recall during their first recall because the buildings that were previously on their left are now on their imagined right. Remember this is all in their imagination—their memory."
This is dramatic evidence of a processing deficit. These patients’ memory of the Piazza del Duomo is complete; they don’t have memory deficits about any portion of the square. They also have complete access to their memory of the square.
"But depending upon their imagined perspective they have a deficit in recalling objects on the left side of their frame of reference. Furthermore, they are apparently unaware of this deficit. Their frame of reference is centered with respect to their body, in memory as well as in real life."
"Apparently, memories like real world scenes are accessed through the contralateral hemisphere. It is not that the memories were laid down with objects on the left missing because they grew up knowing this square long before their brain lesions occurred. This raises issues of consciousness, self-awareness, executive control of memory."
To further complicate matters unilateral visual neglect can be centered with respect to the object instead of the patient’s body. A patient with object-centered unilateral visual neglect. Left: patient attends to examiner’s left hand even when rotated.
"Right: patient neglects examiner’s right hand even when examiner’s body is rotated 90 degrees. Bilateral parietal damage can produce what is called Balint’s syndrome. This is an interesting syndrome because rather than neglecting both sides of objects and seeing nothing as one might expect with bilateral hemifield neglect, they see one object at a time—simultaneous agnosia."
"These patients report that an object appears automatically and is replaced at random with another object and they have no control over what object will be perceived. These patients have ADL problems included getting lost, inability to grasp items and they cannot eat, dress, or move around a room without assistance. They can, however, correctly touch parts of their own bodies."
"The limbic association area receives information from virtually every other association area and therefore can relate all the stimuli of an event, including its emotional context. The emotion associated with an event can determine whether or how long it is remembered. This is important for survival of all organisms."
"Indeed, this is what is meant by learning. You can’t have learning without memory. When hungry it is a great relief to find food and then one is more likely to remember the food place later."
"When one narrowly escapes danger, one is more likely to avoid such predators and places where they reside. The patient HM had his limbic association areas removed bilaterally, he could not form any new explicit memories which rely on context memory, including place, time, and emotion. The anterior association area is in the frontal lobes."
"It is rostral to the postcentral gyri, Rolandic fissure, and premotor areas. It has Sylvian fissure as its posterior boundary. It is referred to as prefrontal cortex."
Early evidence of the role of prefrontal cortex came from the case of Phineas T. Gage. Gage was a foreman on railroad construction in the middle of the 19th century.
"He was reliable, well organized, and hardworking He was tamping in an explosive in a hole drilled into rock with a 13 pound, 3½ foot long iron bar. The charge unexpectedly exploded as he was packing in the explosive charge. What happened was that the tamping rod blew out of the hole and went through the front of his head, destroying large portions of his prefrontal cortex."
"After he recovered physically , his personality had changed. Co-workers reported that “Gage was not Gage. ” He was unreliable."
His actions were impulsive with little regard for consequences. He became an alcoholic and drifter. Prefrontal lobotomies were performed in the first half of the twentieth century to relieve psychotic symptoms.
These have now been replaced with drug therapy. With a unilateral or bilateral prefrontal lobotomy there is a lack of ability remember and relate things over time. Delayed reward has a greater detrimental effect on learning.
Attention span and ability to concentrate are greatly diminished. Abstract reasoning largely disappears. The prefrontal cortex receives massive inputs from the sensory association cortices  and also from the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus.
Lesions of the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus can produce many of the same symptoms as from prefrontal lobotomy. The prefrontal cortex is subdivided into three areas. Prefrontal syndrome  in patients usually refers to damage of the dorsal  prefrontal association area.
Most research in the dorsal prefrontal area is concentrated within the dorsolateral prefrontal area. This is the area  in the above diagram just dorsal to the principal sulcus . This is a very important area for many higher-order cognitive abilities.
"The dorsolateral prefrontal area along with the cingulate cortex are involved in attentional processing, planning, rule learning and memory. When trying to perform arithmetic, for example, the patient may begin successfully on successive subtractions of 7 from 100 but then inexplicably shift and say: “100, 93, 93, 73…63 instead of 100, 93, 86, 79, 72 etc. When sequences are being learned, the dorsolateral prefrontal area and the cingulate cortex are highly active."
But once learning is complete and automated these areas are no longer active. Many neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal area and those in the principal sulcus itself  mediate memory about WHERE an object is located. These neurons receive inputs from a dorsal pathway through the posterior parietal cortex.
"Recordings in monkeys show that “where” neurons respond only to stimuli in a particular position in the visual field and continue to fire during a delay period—presumably memory for the event. When occasionally they stop firing during the delay period, this usually signals that the monkey has forgotten the location. Eye-tracking devices are used to record where the monkey is looking, and the monkey is trained to look towards a particular remembered location."
"In contrast to the dorsolateral prefrontal area, neurons in the small area  in Figure 9. 10A just ventral to the principal sulcus mediate memory about WHAT the object is, its shape and color. This is a target of the ventral visual pathway through the inferior temporal lobe."
The orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex have direct connections to the amygdala and cingulate cortex of the limbic system and thus provide the emotional component to the planned behavior and memory. The dominant neurotransmitter in the prefrontal region is dopamine. Dopamine depletion can create lesion like symptoms.
"Disturbances of the dopaminergic system are thought to contribute to symptoms of schizophrenics and many schizophrenics have hypofunction of the prefrontal cortical regions. Symptoms such as being controlled by alien voices suggest a dysfunction of the executive control system in schizophrenics. For example, if schizophrenic patients are tested on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test blood flow to the prefrontal areas is much less than normal individuals."
"Blood flow to the prefrontal areas is shown to be a functional part of performing this task accurately because when schizophrenics are rewarded for their correct responses blood flow increases much more than it does for normal and they show improved performance. Further evidence for the close interaction between the prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex is that neuroimaging of schizophrenics shows impaired activation of the cingulated cortex in cognitive tasks and postmortem histological analysis has shown abnormalities in the cingulated cortex of schizophrenics. Another way to determine whether or not functions are lateralized to one hemisphere or represented in both hemispheres is to test split-brain patients, patients that have had their corpus callosum transected."
Sectioning the corpus callosum is a last resort treatment of intractable epilepsy. Stimuli can then be input to only one hemisphere without the other being aware of these stimuli. Patients can be tested to see how they process these stimuli.
"Stimuli are presented to only one hemisphere tachistoscopically. Patients focus on a point straight in the middle of a screen. If the stimulus appears on the left, it goes to the right hemisphere."
"If the stimulus appears on the right, it goes to the left hemisphere. So, in response to an cone presented on the right , the patient says “cone. ” But when presented on the left, the patient denies seeing anything, and when pressed to give a response, the patient confabulates."
"So, when the cone stimulus is on the left, is the patient incapable of recognizing the visual stimulus as a cone? Actually, the patient is capable of recognizing the stimulus as a cone. But you have to be clever to show this ability."
"The patient can correctly choose, by feel, the correct object. Or the patient can correctly identify it by pointing to it, but only with his left hand. One might say that this is just matching—even cross modality  matching—but not language."
"But you can convince yourself that this is really language because, if you flash the letters D-O-G to the right hemisphere, patients can pick out the model of a dog---only with their left hands, of course. Other results from split-brain patients have shown that for most people, the left hemisphere is dominant for mathematics as well as language. The right hemisphere is dominant for music, face recognition, and anything to do with spatial relationships."
"For example, even right-handed patients after corpus callosum resectioning  are better able to draw with their left hands than with their right hands because it is the right hemisphere that controls the left hand. Thus, the right hemisphere has some functions that are superior to those of the left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere is not just like the left hemisphere without language. Other examples of superiority of the right hemisphere would be that split-brain patients can fit wooden blocks together of different colors to make a pattern better with their left hands than with their right hands, again showing that the right hemisphere is superior in spatial-perceptual tasks."
"In conclusion, functions of the brain that are localized to specific brain regions have had considerable clinical importance. Localization of function can explain why certain syndromes are characteristic of disease in specific brain regions. Nevertheless, no part of the brain works in isolation."
"Each and every part of the brain works in concert with every other part. When a part of the brain is removed, the resulting behavior may reflect more about the adjusted capacities of the remaining “parts” than the removed part. The right hemisphere is dominant for music, face recognition, and anything to do with spatial relationships."
"For example, even right-handed patients after corpus callosum resectioning  are better able to draw with their left hands than with their right hands because it is the right hemisphere that controls the left hand. Thus, the right hemisphere has some functions that are superior to those of the left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere is not just like the left hemisphere without language. Other examples of superiority of the right hemisphere would be that split-brain patients can fit wooden blocks together of different colors to make a pattern better with their left hands than with their right hands, again showing that the right hemisphere is superior in spatial-perceptual tasks."

Maximal and average life expectancy -- Aging is a normal biological process that is programmed into the genetics of all species."
"Thus aging, per se, is not caused by disease. Each animal species has a maximal life expectancy that is hypothesized to be unchangeable. Figure 10."
"1 is a survival curve for humans illustrating that the maximal life expectancy is approximately 90 years of age. In contrast to maximal life expectancy, the average life expectancy of individuals of a species can be dramatically influenced by environmental influences, especially disease. Thus, Figure 10."
"1 also shows that the average life expectancy has changed markedly. The figure shows that the average life expectancy, represented by “fifty percent survivors” has increased from 47 years in 1900 to 70+ years in 1989. Below are listed some of the biological changes that occur in aging humans in the absence of disease."
"Alzheimer’s disease  has become the most common neurodegenerative disorder, currently affecting nearly twenty five million worldwide. AD, which begins with mild memory deficits and modest neuronal death, is followed by progressive extensive neuronal death, eventually leading to severe dementia. In addition, AD is frequently accompanied by other neurological and personality impairments including slow movements, hampered motor coordination, general confusion and personality change."
"AD patients generally live for about 9 years after initial clinical diagnosis. Thus treatment is necessary for extensive time periods. This not only places a great burden on caregivers, but the economy as well, with an annual cost yearly of $160 billion worldwide."
"AD is estimated to affect over four million people in the USA . The pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease, described below, are associated with profound degeneration of neurons and synapses in a few regions of the CNS, including the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices, all of which are associated with learning and memory processes. The two most characteristic pathological inclusions found in the brains of AD patients are extracellular deposits of β-amyloid peptides  that lead to senile plaque formation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau."
"However, increasing evidence has suggested that inflammation may play a critical role in AD pathogenesis as well. In this chapter, the changes that occur with AD and the way to clinically diagnose the disease are summarized as a means to describe the disease and to illustrate how the physician must clinically evaluate the possibility of AD. According to the Psychiatric Manual three progressive stages or categories of AD diagnosis are defined."
"These include: 1) Suspected AD, 2) Probable AD, and 3) Definite AD. Definite AD can only be diagnosed after pathological brain specimens are examined by either biopsy or autopsy. The characteristics used to diagnose AD are listed below."
"Definite AD. To make the diagnosis of Definite AD, morphological pathological inclusions must be present in the patient’s CNS. The nature of the pathological changes that occur in AD and the use of some of these features in the diagnosis of AS are described below."
"Neurofibrillary tangles. These are non-membrane bound masses of fibers in the cell bodies of neurons, shown in Figure 10. 3."
"Neurofibrillary tangles contain many tightly adherent pairs of helical filaments. These are termed paired helical filaments . Neurofibrillary tangles also contain the same pathological protein, β-amyloid, found in neurite plaques ."
"Paired helical filaments. Because neurons bearing PHF appear intact and functional, PHF are believed to precede the death of a neuron. Because antibodies to cytoskeleton proteins, such as tau and tubulin, cross-react with PHF it is believed that PHF are composed of modified cytoskeletal proteins."
"One hypothesis, discussed below, is that PHF are hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. You will recall that tau protein is a microtubule associated protein  Neurite plaques are defined as spherical clusters of dystrophic neurites surrounding a core of β amyloid and are found predominantly in gray matter. ."
"These 10 - 100 µm diameter structures are believed to be remnants of degenerated axon terminals. Because neurite plaques are much more common in the aged Alzheimer's brain than in the normal aged brain, they are considered a specific marker for Alzheimer's disease. A number of neurite plaques are shown in in Figure 10,4."
"Loss of dendritic branches and spines. As occurs in normal aging, a characteristic feature of AD is a decrease in the number and branches of cortical dendrites and spines. This predicts a decreased synaptic innervation of cortical neurons."
"In AD there is a large decrease in dendritic branches and spines. With the above pathological features in mind, the physician examines the CNS biopsy or on autopsy to determine the presence of these histopathologic features. Following the examination of the histological sections, the age related criteria in Table I are used to establish the diagnosis of Definite AD."
"The areas where plaques and tangle are most abundant are usually the temporal- and neo-cortex. The histopathologic analysis requires multiple CNS samples for microscopic examination. Because these structures also occur in normal aging, the diagnosis of AD depends on the number of pathological features based on the patient’s age; with older age, more inclusions are required before AD is indicated."
"Other regions examined are the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and spinal cord. AD, in few cases, has been found to be associated with specific families. Although this happens rather infrequently, it has led to the classification of AD as either familial or sporadic."
"Sporadic AD refers to disease that has no clear-cut genetic basis. It is the majority of AD seen in the general population. However, a genetic predisposition may exist for even this disease, as will be discussed at the end of this chapter."
"Familian AD  refers to an inherited disease that is associated with families. Several examples of AD mapped to a specific gene exist. Based on the typical age of onset, familial AD has been sub-classified as early onset and late onset."
"Both of these will also be presented in more detail at the end of this chapter. AD, in few cases, has been found to be associated with specific families. Although this happens rather infrequently, it has led to the classification of AD as either familial or sporadic."
"Sporadic AD refers to disease that has no clear-cut genetic basis. It is the majority of AD seen in the general population. However, a genetic predisposition may exist for even this disease, as will be discussed at the end of this chapter."

"Both of these will also be presented in more detail at the end of this chapter. ACH Hypothesis. Among these, the neurotransmitter to receive the greatest attention has been acetylcholine."
Morphological and biochemical evidence has implicated a specific deterioration of the cholinergic system that connects the midbrain nucleus basalis of Meynert to the cerebral cortex. The location of the cholinergic neurons is shown in Figure 10. 5.
"Beta Amyloid / abnormal protein. An important approach to the study of AD is to analyze the abnormal structures found in the AD brain. One of the principle proteins present is β amyloid, named for its β pleated confirmation."
"This protein was purified, sequenced and an antibody to a synthetic peptide mimicking the sequence produced. The antibody reacts to cerebral β amyloid and not to other protein in plaques and tangles showing that β amyloid is a constituent of AD neuropathological structures. Isolation of the cDNA encoding β amyloid revealed a number of important properties of this protein as described below."
"β amyloid is a 4,000-4,500 MW protein that is part of a larger 79,000 MW protein. The larger protein is called amyloid precursor protein . Analysis of the hydrophobicity plots predicts that APP spans the cell membrane and extends into the extracellular space ."
"A number of observations of the biology of amyloid has lead to the hypothesis that amyloid is the toxic substance that initiates the pathology of AD. This hypothesis, called the amyloid hypothesis, is based on morphological, biochemical, and molecular biological evidence that implicates β amyloid as a seminal, causative agent in Alzheimer's disease. The role of β amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease is based on the following observations:  Amyloid is found in both plaques and tangles and is present in a number of other dementias such as Down's syndrome."
"Thus, it is hypothesized to be an essential factor in the cause of degeneration. Antibodies to β amyloid show pre-amyloid deposits in both Down's syndrome and AD brains. This implies that focal amyloid deposition may be the early event in plaque formation for both these diseases."
"A mutation in the gene for APP is located on chromosome 21. This gene has been identified in several cases of Familial Alzheimer's disease . Also, recall that Down’s syndrome patients have three copies of chromosome 21."
"Based on the above observations, it is hypothesized that an abnormal proteolytic processing of APP occurs in AD. This abnormal processing is believed to generate a toxic 40-kDa peptide referred to as β amyloid or Aβ . Recent research has shown that under normal circumstances a proteolytic enzyme, α secretase, cuts APP to produce a normal biological messenger molecule ."
"However, it appears that in AD, the APP is abnormally proteolyzed by two other secretases  to produce the abnormal protein, β amyloid . These two secretases, termed β and γ secretase, have been cloned to determine their biology and structural properties. The goal is to generate drugs that can block the secretases and the initiation or progression of AD."
"One or the other of these secretases may be the product of the senilin genes of familial AD. Also a recent hypothesis, based on the observation that zinc or copper facilitates the formation of insoluble Aβ, is that drugs that chelate these metals will be a good treatment for AD. Clinical trails are underway examining this hypothesis."
"Recent  research has shown that there may be an abnormal clearing of Aβ that is responsible for its accumulation and toxicity. This provides another strategy for dealing with AD, enhancing the clearance of Aβ. How Aβ is toxic to cells is not known."
"One possibility is that it stimulates increased calcium influx, which can lead to cell death through the hyper-phosphorylation of cytostructural proteins, such as tau . Also, recent evidence indicates that Aβ can stimulate the formation of free radicals that may kill neurons. A single methionine in the Aβ molecule appears to be capable of augmenting free radical formation and neuronal death in neuronal cell cultures."
"High levels of antioxidants such as vitamin E protect neurons from this adverse effect. There is also evidence that Aβ may have normal functions in the brain. It has been shown to be: 1) a specific ligand for a number of different receptors and other molecules, 2) transported by complex trafficking pathways, 3) modulated in response to a variety of environmental stressors, and 4) able to induce pro-inflammatory activities."
Recent evidence indicates that Aβ may be an antimicrobial peptide that functions normally as a part of an the innate immune system for the brain. How these biological functions relate to the possible role of Aβ in AD is not known. Tau protein hypothesis - Molecular research over the past ten years suggests that abnormal processing of tau  may also be an important aspect of AD pathology.
"Tau is a microtubule associate protein  composed of a family of six proteins in mammals. These proteins associate with microtubules in the axons of neurons to regulate microtubule growth, assembly and cross-linking. In normal CNS, MAPs, other than tau, regulate microtubule function in dendrites and the cell soma."
"However in the degenerating neurons in AD patients, 1) tau is found throughout the neuron, not just in the axon. Further 2) tau is also abnormal in that it is phosphorylated much more extensively in AD than in normal brain. Finally, 3) the tau within degenerating neurons is often associated with PHF."
"Thus the hyper-phosphorylation of tau may be responsible for the altered subcellular distribution of tau and eventual cell death. These observations point to the abnormal phosphorylation and distribution of tau as an important aspect of the pathology of AD. Importantly, the demonstration that tau is distributed differently in degenerating neurons in Alzheimer’s disease than in normal aging has been interpreted to show that Alzheimer’s disease is not merely the end stage of normal aging."
"One unifying hypothesis is that tau’s hyperphosphorylation may be induced by the β amyloid. Presenilins - Mutations in two additional genes, presenilin-1 , located on chromosome 14 and presenilin-2 , located on chromosome, have been determined to be a cause of specific forms of FAD. PS-2 is a close homologue of PS1."
"To date 45 different PS-1 mutations and two PS-2 mutations have been identified in FAD and these mutations account for up 50 % of early-onset FAD. A suggested mechanism of the mutated presenilins is that they facilitate the alternative proteolysis of APP by γ secretase to form Aβ. This conclusion is supported by evidence that mice transfected with only APP developed plaques late in life, whereas mice with both APP and PS-1 mutations show plaques at a much younger age."
This suggests that PS-1 ratchets up the pace of the AD disease process. ApoE4 hypothesis. ApoE proteins facilitate the shuttling of cholesterol into cells.
"Researchers at Duke University observed that a specific variant, ApoE4, is elevated in the CSF of Alzheimer’s patients. This observation triggered biochemical and genetic studies of ApoE4 and its role in Alzheimer’s disease. As a consequence, the results of several genetic linkage studies and ApoE4 binding studies linked the ApoE cholesterol shuttling protein to Alzheimer’s disease."
"These results are: The apoE4 gene is positively correlated with several classes of Alzheimer's. Of the three variants of ApoE, the ApoE4 variant predominates in familial Alzheimer’s, whereas the ApoE3 form is most common in the general population. A similar genetic skew appears in “sporadic” Alzheimer’s."
"The presence of ApoE4 predisposes one to Alzheimer’s. Individuals with two copies of this allele are most likely to contract Alzheimer’s, and to develop it earlier as shown in Figure 10,9. The current information concerning the causes of AFD indicates that it is a genetically heterogeneous disorder."
"Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit familial inheritance, certain genes appear to act as risk factors for AD. Currently, the best known genetic risk factor for AD is the inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E on chromosome 19. This gene is implicated in up to 50% of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's cases."
"However, geneticists agree that numerous other genes probably also act as risk factors or have protective effects that influence the development of late onset AD. Over 400 genes have been tested for association with late-onset sporadic AD. There is also considerable evidence that Aβ and APP on chromosome 21 play an important role in the etiology of AD."
The evidence for genetic basis in FAD and a role for Aβ in sporadic AD include the following: 1) Individuals with Down’s syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 and consequently make large amount of APP. 2) Down’s syndrome patients exhibit brain pathology virtually identical to AD and suffer dementia. 2) A direct linkage has been made between chromosome 21 and a subset of FAD.
3) In addition a direct linkage has been made between mutations in the genes for presenilins and the facilitation of the abnormal processing of APP to produce Aβ. All of these observations support a role for amaloid in AD pathology. Several clear risk factors exist for AD.
"These include being female, family history of neurodegenerative diseases, less education and less intellectually demanding jobs. How these factors fit into the etiology of AD is not known. The blood-brain barrier  protects the neural tissue from variations in blood composition and toxins."
"Elsewhere in the body the extracellular concentrations of hormones, amino acids and potassium undergo frequent fluctuations, especially after meals, exercise or stressful times. Since many of these molecules regulate neuronal excitability, a similar change in the composition of interstitial fluid in the CNS can lead to uncontrolled brain activity. The endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier are highly specialized to allow precise control over the substances that enter or leave the brain."
"Discovery of blood-brain barrier. The discovery of the BBB dates back more than 100 years when, in the 1880s, Paul Ehrlich observed that intravenous administration of certain dyes  stained all organs except the brain and the spinal cord. He concluded that the dyes had a lower affinity for binding to the nervous system as compared to other tissues."
"In 1913, Edwin Goldman, an associate of Ehrlich, demonstrated the very same dyes, when directly injected into the cerebrospinal fluid , readily stained nervous tissue but not other tissues. The term “blood-brain barrier” was coined, however, by Lewandowsky in 1898, after he and his colleagues had performed experiments to demonstrate that neurotoxic agents affected brain function only when directly injected into the brain but not when injected into the vascular system. It took an additional 70 years until Reese and colleagues localized the barrier to the capillary endothelial cells within the brain by electron-microscopic studies."
"Endothelial cells in brain capillaries are the site of the BBB. The BBB in adults consists of a complex cellular system of a highly specialized basal membrane, a large number of pericytes embedded in the basal membrane and astrocytic end feet. Whereas the endothelial cells form the barrier proper, the interaction with adjacent cells seems to be required for the development of the barrier."
"The brain endothelial cells differ from endothelial cells from other organs in two important ways. First, continuous tight junctions are present between brain endothelial cells. These tight junctions prevent paracellular movement of molecules."
"Second, there are no detectable transendothelial pathways such as intracellular vesicles. These properties of brain endothelial cells provide a barrier between the blood and the brain. Some of the key processes are depicted in Figure 11,1."
The continuous tight junctions that join the endothelial cells in the brain capillaries limit the diffusion of molecules across the BBB. The basement  membrane provides structural support for the capillary and specific proteins present in the basement membrane have been proposed to be involved in the development of the BBB. Astrocytic foot processes release specific factors and are necessary for the development of the BBB.
"Astrocytic foot processes contain water channels  that allow water uptake and contribute to brain swelling. Transport carriers for glucose and essential amino acids facilitate the movement of these solutes into the brain. Since brain cells cannot synthesize these essential amino acids, it is taken up from the blood."
"Secondary transport systems appear to cause efflux of small molecules and nonessential amino acids from the brain to the blood. Sodium ion transporters on the luminal membrane and Na,K-ATPase on the anti-luminal membrane account for movement of sodium from the blood to the brain. The large number of mitochondrias present in the brain endothelial cells provide energy for the function of this Na,K-ATPase."
"The ""enzymatic blood-brain-barrier"": Metabolic processes within the brain capillary endothelial cells are important to blood-brain function and control the entry of neurotransmitters into the brain. The tight junctions between endothelial cells are responsible for the barrier function. Occludin was the first integral membrane protein found to be exclusively localized within the tight junctions."
"However, mice carrying the null mutation in the occludin gene develop morphologically normal tight junctions, indicating that occluding is not essential for proper tight junction formation. In contrast to occluding, claudins have been shown to be required for the formation of tight junctions. The integral membrane proteins of tight junctions are linked to the cytoskeleton via zone occluding-1 , ZO-2 and ZO-3."
"In addition, non-occludin adherens junctions are found intermingled with tight junctions. In adherens junctions, the endothelial specific, integral membrane proteins VE-cadherins are found. Furthermore, a family of proteins called junctional adhesion molecules , and recently discovered endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecules , are localized in the tight junctions of the BBB."
Their precise function in BBB integrity remains to be determined. All areas of the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier. The structures located at strategic positions in the midline of the ventricular system and lack the BBB are collectively referred to as circumventricular organs .
"In these non-barrier regions, the tight junctions between endothelial cells are discontinuous thus allowing entry of molecules. Many of these areas participate in hormonal control. Substances with High Lipid Solubility May Move Across the BBB by Simple Diffusion."
"Diffusion is the major entry mechanism for most psychoactive drugs. Figure 11,2 shows that the rate of entry of compounds that diffuse into the brain depends on their lipid solubility. The lipid solubility is estimated by oil/water partition coefficient."
"Figure 11,5a depicts how the oil/water partition coefficient is calculated. Figure 11,5b shows the relationship between oil/water partition coefficient and brain penetration of selected molecules. Water."
"Water readily enters the brain. As a consequence of its high permeability, water moves freely into and out of the brain as the osmolarity of the plasma changes. This phenomenon is clinically useful, since the intravenous administration of poorly permeable compounds such as mannitol will osmotically dehydrate the brain and reduce intracranial pressure."
"This method is sometimes used in head trauma patients to reduce intracranial pressure. Gases. Gases such as CO2, O2 and volatile anesthetics diffuse rapidly into the brain."
"As a consequence, the rate at which their concentration in the brain comes into equilibrium with plasma is limited primarily by the cerebral blood flow rate. Carrier-mediated transport enables molecules with low lipid solubility to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Glucose from blood enters the brain by a transport protein."
Glucose is the primary energy substrate of the brain. Glucose transport protein  is highly enriched in brain capillary endothelial cells. These transporters carry glucose molecules through the blood brain barrier.
"Although rare, patients with Glut-1 deficiency  can have severe learning difficulties. Low glucose sugar levels in the cerebrospinal, but not in the blood, will identify the condition. The essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the brain and, therefore, must be supplied from protein breakdown and diet."
"Phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, tryptophan, methionine and histidine, which are essential amino acids, and also the precursor of dopamine, L-DOPA, enter the brain as rapidly as glucose. These amino acids are transported into the brain by the leucine-preferring or the L-type transport proteins. These compounds compete with each other for entry into the brain."
"Therefore, an elevation of plasma level of one will inhibit uptake of the others. This competition may be important for certain metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria , where high levels of phenylalanine in plasma reduce brain uptake of other essential amino acids. Small neutral amino acids, such as alanine, glycine, proline and GABA , are markedly restricted in their entry into the brain."
"These amino acids are non-essential amino acids and are transported by alanine-preferring or A-type transport protein. The A-type transport protein is not present on the luminal surface of the blood brain barrier. In contrast, these small neutral amino acids appear to be transported out of the brain across the blood-brain-barrier."
"P-glycoproteins are ATP-driven pumps which confer multi-drug resistance to cancer cells by pumping drugs out of the cells. These proteins are expressed in brain endothelial cells that can limit the BBB permeability of hydrophobic compounds, such as cyclosporin A and vinblastine, by pumping them from the endothelial cells back to the blood. Metabolic processes within the brain capillary endothelial cells are important to blood-brain function."
"Most neurotransmitters present in the blood do not enter the brain because of their low lipid solubility and lack of specific transport carriers in the luminal membrane of the capillary endothelial cell . In contrast, L-DOPA, the precursor for dopamine, has an affinity for the L-type transporter. Therefore, it enters the brain more easily from the blood than would be predicted based on its lipid solubility."
"Patients with Parkinson's disease are treated with L-DOPA rather than with dopamine because of this fact. However, the penetration of L-DOPA into the brain is limited by the presence of enzymes L-DOPA decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase within the capillary endothelial cells. This ""enzymatic blood-brain barrier"" limits passage of L-DOPA into the brain and explains the need for large doses of L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease."
Therapy is currently enhanced by concurrent treatment with an inhibitor of L-DOPA decarboxylase. Endothelial monoamine oxidase may also play a role in the inactivation of neurotransmitters released by neuronal activity. Monoamines show very little uptake when presented from the luminal side.
"The uptake systems for monoamines are present in the antiluminal surface of the brain capillary endothelial cells. The brain endothelial capillary also contains a variety of other neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzymes such as cholinesterases, GABA transaminases, aminopeptidase and endopeptidases. In addition, several drug and toxin metabolizing enzymes are also found in the brain capillaries."
"Thus the ""enzymatic blood brain barrier"" protects the brain not only from circulating neurotransmitters but also from many toxins. Compromised BBB and Disease. BBB dysfunction can lead to neuronal damage and disturbed brain function."
"Diseases such as encephalitis, multiple sclerosis , stroke or tumors induce deterioration of the BBB with devastating influence on neuronal function. These conditions decrease the production of the tight junction protein claudin. Brain tumors cause complete breakdown of the BBB that leads to peritumoral edema."
"Furthermore, tumor cells secrete specific factors [e. g. vascular endothelial growth factor  that induces formation of new blood vessels ] which tend to be leaky."
"Bypassing the BBB with drugs. A number of drugs of potential therapeutic value do not readily enter the brain because they have low lipid solubility and are not transported by specific carriers present in the BBB. To overcome this limitation, schemes have been developed to enhance drug entry into the brain."
"1) One way to bypass the BBB is to deliver the drug directly into the CSF. This approach can be used to treat patients with meningitis or cancerous cells in the CSF. 2) Certain vasoactive compounds such as bradykinin and histamine, which do not alter BBB in normal people, can enhance permeability of BBB in pathological conditions."
These compounds can be used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents into the brain. 3) Drugs can be synthesized with high BBB permeability to improve entry into the brain. Most neuroactive drugs are effective because they dissolve in lipids and easily enter the brain.
"For example, heroin and morphine are very similar in structure. However, heroin, which has two acetyl groups, is more lipid soluble. This greater lipid solubility of heroin explains its more rapid onset of action."
"Once within the brain, the acetyl group of heroin is removed enzymatically to produce morphine, which only slowly leaves the brain. An understanding of the transport process is crucial to development of the next generation of drugs useful in treating brain diseases. The brain is metabolically one of the most active of all organs in the body."
"The brain does not store excess energy and derives almost all of its energy needs from aerobic oxidation of glucose. Therefore, it requires a continuous supply of glucose and oxygen to meet its energy requirements. Most of the brain's energy consumption is used for active transport of ions to sustain and restore the membrane potentials discharged during the process of excitation and conduction."
"When blood flow to the brain stops and absence of oxygen and blood occurs, a loss of consciousness results in 5-10 seconds. If the blood flow is not resumed within several minutes, there is permanent brain damage. It is well known that during crises, such as cardiac arrest, damage to the brain occurs earliest and is most decisive in determining the degree of recovery."
"The absence of glucose is equally destructive, but the time course resulting in irreversible damage from hypoglycemia is longer because other substrates can be used. Different regions of the brain have different energy requirements, which are related to the neuronal activity in these regions. Measurement of amounts of glucose used per minute in different brain regions of a normal conscious rat and monkey demonstrates glucose utilization varies widely throughout the brain."
"Moreover, the average value in the gray matter is approximately five times more than that in the white matter. The amount of blood flow is directly related to brain activity. In a separate group of animals the amount of blood flow to brain areas was determined."
"The results show that more blood flows to the area of the brain with high metabolic activity. Figure 11,10 shows there is an excellent correlation between the amount of glucose uses and local cerebral blood flow. Regulation of blood flow to a brain area is achieved by control of dilation of cerebral vessels."
"The dilation of blood vessels is controlled by local factors such as nitric oxide , PaCO2, PaO2 and pH. High NO, high PaCO2, low PaCO2  and low pH, which are produced as a result of brain activity, tend to dilate the blood vessels and increase blood flow. The rate of production of these chemicals is dependent of activity and rates of energy metabolism."
"Therefore, blood flow to a brain region is related to neuronal activity in that region. Glucose utilization and brain imaging. Glucose metabolism is the major energy source for the brain."
"Glucose from the blood enters the brain with help of Glut-1 transport protein. Once inside a brain cell, it enters the glycolytic pathway, where it is converted to pyruvate and then metabolized through the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. A fraction of ATP molecules is used to generate high energy phosphocreatine molecules."
"Under conditions, aerobic metabolism of glucose is capable of providing the brain with sufficient energy from ATP and phosphocreatine to maintain normal function. When brain failure occurs, there is a loss of phosphocreatine initially, followed by ATP depletion, which generally signals severe damage to the brain. Glucose deprivation can result in abnormal brain function."
"Hypoglycemia, which can result from excessive insulin, is associated with changes in mental state. These changes can be rapidly reversed by glucose administration. In certain circumstances, such as during starvation, the brain can use “ketone bodies” in place of glucose as substrates."
"Ketone bodies, acetoacetate and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate are formed from catabolism of fatty acids by the liver. The ketone bodies are metabolized to generate acyl-CoA which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle  at a sufficient rate to meet the metabolic demand of the brain. Measurement of local glucose utilization."
"The local energy metabolism is coupled to local functional activity. Using an autoradiography analog of glucose, 2-deoxyglucose , has been employed to measure glucose metabolism in experimental animals. Figure 11,4 illustrates the fundamental principle of radioactive deoxy glucose method for measuring the local cerebral glucose utilization."
"Glucose utilization begins with phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase. The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is not retained in the tissues. Instead, it is metabolized further to products such as CO2 and H2O that leave the tissue."
"2-deoxyglucose is an analog of glucose and is transported across the blood-brain barrier by the glucose carrier system. Inside brain cells, 2-deoxyglucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase to deoxyglucose-6-phosphate  and cannot be further degraded into CO2 and H2O. Instead it is trapped and accumulates in the tissue quantitatively for a reasonable length of time."
"By putting a label on deoxyglucose , it is possible to measure the rate of labeled deoxyglucose-6-phosphate formation. The amount of 18FDG-6-phosphate can be directly determined using positron emission tomography . The 2-deoxyglucose method has been modified for human use with PET, with short lived positron emitting isotopes labeled to the 2-deoxyglucose."
"Because of the coupling of metabolism to function, functional activation by specific stimuli tasks leads to regional increase in the glucose metabolism in corresponding cerebral structures. Movement of fingers and hands increases metabolism in the respective brain regions. In right handed volunteers, spontaneous speech increased metabolic activities in Broca's region."
Presentation of visual images increases glucose utilization in the primary visual cortex. Functional MRI. A variant of MRI called functional MRI  is based on the increase in the blood flow to specific brain regions that accompanies neuronal activity.
"Increase in blood flow results in a local decrease in deoxyhemoglobin due to less oxygen extraction. Deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic and serves as the source for the signal in fMRI. Unlike PET, fMRI uses a signal intrinsic to the brain and has emerged as the technology of choice for probing brain function."
Convulsive disorders are functional disturbances of brain activity and lead to marked changes in brain metabolism and cerebral blood flow. The metabolic changes detected by PET can frequently complement electrophysiological recordings to locate epileptogenic foci. This information helps neurosurgeons to surgically remove the epileptogenic focus.
Metabolic measurements using PET can be used to determine the size of infarction following ischemic stroke. Brain tumors have high metabolic needs and are heavily vascularized. PET or fMRI can be used to locate the tumor and evaluate effectiveness of a therapy.
"Brain tissue is composed of neurons and other supporting cells, such as glia. Neurons in the brain are interconnected to make functional circuits. If these connections are interrupted as a result of trauma, brain function is impaired."
"Neurons are post-mitotic and therefore cannot divide to produce new neurons making neuronal loss as a result of trauma profoundly detrimental to normal brain function. At present, there is no effective therapy available to treat victims of brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury  remains the leading cause of death and disability for those under the age of 44 years."
"It has been estimated that nearly 2 million people suffer some degree of head injury every year in the United States alone. Although the vast majority of these do not seek medical treatment, approximately 400,000 to 500,000 TBI victims require hospitalization. In the US, the societal cost for TBI has been estimated at between $48 and $83."
5 billion per year. Only 12. 5% of the annual financial expense is accounted for by direct cost .
"Since most TBI patients are young and in their peak productive years, the indirect costs  represent the greatest loss to society. The behavioral and psychological difficulties experienced by some patients are reported as being devastating not only to the patient but to the family and society as well. Age: TBI most commonly occurs among infants and children, individuals 15 to 29 years of age, and the elderly ."
"Sex: The male to female incidence of TBI has been estimated to be 2 to 1. According to the most recent statistics from the National Institutes of Health , the major cause of TBI is vehicular accidents, violent acts, falls, and sports-related injury. A head injury is usually a brief event occurring in less than 200 msec."
"Traumatic brain damage is a result of  and indirect  processes. The primary injury can be lessened through preventative measures, such as education of potential victims , use of safety equipment  and enforcing laws for individual and public safety. In contrast, secondary injuries are potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions because of their delayed onset and progression over minutes to months after the initial trauma."
"Unfortunately, no effective treatments to abate secondary injuries are currently available Brain trauma can be broadly divided into three categories. Inertia injury. Inertial injuries are commonly associated with Diffuse Axonal Injury ."
"Axons are highly vulnerable to damage following closed head inertia injury. Axonal swelling and disconnection can be seen in mild, moderate and sever TBI patients. A subset of axons undergo axotomy as a result of primary injury, however, the majority undergo progressive changes leading to secondary axotomy."
TBI causes local mechanical and/or biochemical disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton. This causes axonal swelling due to continued delivery of organelles to the site of injury. This continued swelling results in the disconnection of proximal axon bulb  from its distal axonal segment.
"Over time the distal axonal segment undergoes Wallerian degeneration, with the downstream deafferentation of the target site. Impact injury. Impact injuries are often accompanied by the formation of hematomas."
"Penetrating injury. Penetrating injuries are commonly associated with post-traumatic epilepsy. The Glasgow coma scale  is a means of grading severity in TBI and is based on the patient's response to eye opening, best motor response and best verbal response."
"The Glasgow coma score is calculated from the scale and ranges from 3 to 15. Head injured patients are classified as having mild TBI if their GCS score is 13 to 15; a moderate injury if the GCS is 9 to 12, and a severe injury if their GCS score is 3 to 8. Cognitive and behavioral disturbances are the primary contributors to disability in about two thirds of TBI patients."
"In the other one third of the patients, motor deficits and other neurophysical sequelae contribute equally or more as compared to neuropsychological sequelae. Neuropsychological deficits following TBI is related to the region of cerebral damage. Diffuse cerebral damage to temporal, frontal, orbital and parietal regions result in cognitive impairments, involving memory, attention, information processing speed, intellectual functioning, language, executive functions and visuospatial ability."
"Level of consciousness and orientation. Loss of consciousness is the clinical hallmark of head injury and reflects both the amount of brain damage and its distribution. In its mildest degree, a concussion may be expressed by the subject’s awareness and memory without loss of consciousness ."
"""Coma"" is applied to more profound impairments of consciousness. An altered level of consciousness may occur in the acute stage following TBI as a result of a diffuse injury to the cerebral hemispheres or damage to the brainstem reticular formation. Altered consciousness is often accompanied by confusion and disorientation."
"Orientation is assessed by asking the patient his name, the date [day of week, month, year] and location [city, name of the hospital, floor number, room number, etc]. Memory and temporal lobe damage. Memory is the most severely affected and most frequently reported symptom by TBI patients and their relatives."
"Anterograde amnesia  as well as retrograde amnesia  is observed. Anterograde amnesia is frequently referred to as post-traumatic amnesia . In patients with diffused TBI, PTA is thought to be a reliable index of the severity of injury."
"PTA is defined as the approximate time post-trauma when the patient establishes memory of day-to-day ongoing events. If PTA is less than 1 hour, the injury is assumed to be mild; if less than 24 hours, it is moderate; more than 24 hours but less than one month, the injury is severe; and when PTA is greater than 1 month, the injury is thought to be extremely severe. The longer the duration of PTA, the more likely the patient has significant neurological disability, especially with regard to cognitive function."
"Memory impairments may impact a patient's progress in a rehabilitation program, especially if the ability to learn new information is affected. Damage to the temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is associated with memory impairments. As will be discussed later, neurons in the hippocampus express high levels of glutamate receptors and often die as a result of TBI."
"Attention, concentration, executive functions, behavioral disturbance and frontal lobe damage. The frontal lobe comprises a vast expansion of cortex and white matter anterior to the central sulcus. Humans have a tremendous increase in volume of the prefrontal region compared with other higher primates."
"Damage to the frontal lobe can compromise complex decision-making, foresight and social conduct. Attention and concentration difficulties are the second most frequently reported complaint of TBI patients with frontal lobe injuries. Patients who have mild injury usually recover from attention deficits within three months, in contrast to those with severe injuries, who may have more permanent deficits."
"Slowing of cognitive function and distractibility are also common findings. Mild TBI patients, although they perform well on standard ability tests, report that cognitive tasks demand more effort than prior to the injury. Attention and concentration may be informally evaluated during the course of the patient examination."
Patients may have difficulty attending to the interview and may be easily distracted by external stimuli such as hallway activity. Speed of cognitive processing may also be grossly assessed by noting the patient's response time to questions or commands. Executive functions are a type of brain function that motivates self initiated behavior and govern its appropriateness.
"Executive functions are needed for problem solving, planning and decision-making and damage to prefrontal cortex can cause deficits in these functions. Furthermore, verbal fluency, hypothesis generation, use of feedback and shift of strategies are also impaired. Behavioral disturbances are a common manifestation after severe brain injury, with personality change, slowness, irritability, bad temper, fatigue, rapid mood change and depression."
"The orbital frontal regions have been implicated in impulsivity, anger control, aggressiveness, sexual acting out and social judgment. Damage to orbital frontal region can cause release of previously inhibited behaviors and impair the ability to interpret social signals. Visual disturbances and occipital lobe damage."
"The occipital lobes are the posterior part of hemispheres, and can be divided into the primary visual cortex and visual association cortices. Damage to these areas will alter visual perception. Neglect and parietal lobe damage."
"Neglect refers to a phenomenon in which a patient fails to attend to a portion of extrapersonal or intrapersonal space. In the visual modality, in which neglect is most often manifested, the patient may fail to attend to the left hemispace, ignoring objects, persons, and movements that occur in the left side. Such a presentation is commonly caused by lesion in the right parietal and occipitoparietal region."
"Severe neglect often occurs in the acute stage of brain injury, often in the first few days or weeks after the onset of brain damage. Several months after the onset of the lesion, most patients have recovered substantially, although subtle attentional deficits for the left-sided stimuli may still persist. Focal injury to the dominant parietal lobe may result in impairment of mathematical skills."
"Deficits may limit the patient in his ability to manage finances or participate in basic community activities, such as shopping. Calculation skills can be easily assessed by having the patient perform serial subtraction of sevens from one hundred, although more complex multiplication and division problems can also be administered. However, one must take pre-morbid educational history into account when interpreting the results of these tests."
Speech and language. Language skills are commonly impaired following TBI that involve the dominant hemisphere. Difficulty with spoken and written language or problems with language processing can occur.
"Language deficits are usually accompanied by other cognitive impairments. The most common feature of traumatic aphasia is anomia, which is characterized by difficulty in naming, word-finding deficits, and paraphasic errors. Broca's aphasia is more common in a penetrating-type injury due to a lesion of the dominant frontal lobe."
"Wernicke's aphasia occurs less frequently following TBI and is caused by focal injury to the dominant temporal lobe. Higher language skills such as complex auditory processing, spelling, sentence construction, synonyms, antonyms, and abstract language skills, such as picture description, can be impaired. Depression."
"Depression occurs frequently after brain injury. TBI patients who experience depression may report worry, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and social withdrawal. It is likely that there are direct and indirect factors related to the development of depression in brain-injured persons."
Brain damage can produce direct neurophysiological and neurochemical changes that may induce depressive symptomatology. The secondary reaction of the patient to the implications of newly acquired disabilities certainly is a frequent and understandable source of depression. Cranial nerve damage.
TBI can damage one or more of the cranial nerves resulting in specific deficits. Olfactory dysfunction occurs in approximately 7% of patients with TBI. This figure approaches 20% in TBI patients who have suffered from loss of consciousness.
"Furthermore, the olfactory nerve is the most commonly affected cranial nerve in mild TBI. Impairment in detection of smell is usually caused by frontal or occipital blows causing direct injury to the olfactory pathways. Olfactory dysfunction can lead to functional impairment, including diminished pleasure and potential safety problems due to inability to detect dangerous smells such as gas."
Post-traumatic epilepsy. Epileptic seizures occur in 2. 5 to 5% of patients with traumatic brain injury.
"In 1930, Foerester and Penfield induced seizure activity by electrical stimulation of areas surrounding a gunshot lesion of cerebral cortex. These findings suggested the presence of an epileptic zone or penumbra surrounding the site of injury. Furthermore, retraction of dura that had become adherent to the damaged cortex also triggered seizures."
This hypothesis is supported by clinical findings that head injuries associated with dural penetration are associated with the highest incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy . An intriguing hypothesis of post- traumatic epilepsy has been the implication of blood breakdown products in the cellular events that lead to epileptogenesis. An important role for iron deposition has been supported by experimental studies in animals.
Another possibility is that TBI can create imbalances between neuronal excitation and inhibition that can lead to post-traumatic epileptogenesis. TBI is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Epidemiological studies have suggested that head injury may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.
"Histopathological examination of brains from patients who died as a consequence of head trauma has shown amyloid beta  deposition. It is also interesting to note that demential pugilistica  is also associated with memory loss and diffuse Ab deposition. Carriers of the apolipoprotein E4  allele, which may play a direct role in Ab deposition in vivo, have been shown to be an increase risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease."
"Head-injured patients with apoE4 are more than twice as likely as those without apoE4 to have an unfavorable outcome. As indicate above, traumatic injury to the central nervous system is a progressive disorder with two distinct components. The initial, immediate biomechanical damage  is defined as structural damage to neurons, their supporting cells and vasculature."
Secondary injury consists of progressive cellular damage resulting from degradative biochemical processes that occur as a response to the primary injury. The recognition of secondary injury as a progressive biochemical disorder implies that a window of time exists in which effective pharmacotherapy could be administered. Excitatory amino acid receptors.
Levels of extracellular excitatory amino acids  are increased following brain trauma. These neurotransmitters activate specific cell surface receptors causing influx of sodium and calcium ions into the cytosol. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
Binding of glutamate to NMDA receptors allows influx of sodium and calcium ions into neurons. Influx of sodium leads to neuronal swelling and increase intracellular calcium causes cell death. Antagonists for NMDA and non-NMDA receptors have been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental TBI.
"Clinical trials using excitatory amino acid blockers, however, have shown discouraging results and unwanted side effects, namely psychotropic problems. Calcium ions. Among ions, calcium has drawn the most attention."
"This ion has been implicated in cerebral edema, vasospasm and cell death following injury to the CNS. Increases in intracellular calcium can occur via multiple pathways including, NMDA receptors, calcium channels and release of calcium from intracellular stores. Sustained elevations of intracellular calcium are toxic."
"The molecular events triggered by elevated calcium include activation of proteases, lipases, generation of free radicals and impairment of mitochondrial function leading to energy failure. Proteolytic mechanisms of cell death. The calpain family of proteases are activated by elevated intracellular calcium."
"Calpains proteolyze many cellular proteins including cytoskeletal proteins, excitatory amino acid receptors, cell adhesion molecules and enzymes. Breakdown of these proteins causes irreversible structural and functional alterations leading to cellular necrosis. Another family of proteases, the caspases, also cause cell death following CNS injury."
Caspases are involved in neuronal apoptosis. Apoptosis differs from necrosis in that cell lysis does not occur and is a relatively slower process of cell death. Phospholipases.
"Elevated intracellular calcium phospholipases, enzymes that degrade membrane lipids, increase following TBI. Breakdown of membrane lipids  result in loss of cellular integrity, ionic imbalance and cell death. Free radicals."
"Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that damage neuronal, glial and vascular membrane phospholipids and cause oxidation of cellular proteins and nucleic acids. The brain appears to be particularly vulnerable to such oxidative injury. It contains relatively high concentrations of readily peroxidizable fatty acids."
"Furthermore, the brain is poorly supplied with protective antioxidant enzymes and endogenous antioxidant compounds. Free radicals cause widespread cellular and vascular damage. Potential sources of oxygen free radicals within the injured brain include mitochondrial leakage, arachidonic acid metabolism, xanthine oxidase pathway and catecholamine oxidation."
"Several drugs have been tested for their ability to protect free radical-mediated damage. Superoxide dismutase  and its polyethylene glycol-conjugate , which has a longer biological half life, has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models. However, a multi-center study did not show a significantly improved outcome in patients who received PEG-SOD compared to those who received placebo."
"Secondary Injury. The pathology of TBI reflects the initial insult, resulting from mechanical damage to neural and vascular structures , and the evolution of a cascade of secondary events that impair function, damage structures, and promote further cell death collectively referred to as secondary injury. Secondary injury encompasses a number of pathological processes that can continue to evolve over a period of days, weeks or even months, after the primary insult."
"For example, neurons in the CNS that are synaptically connected not only release neurotransmitters but also neurotrophic factors  that are critical for their survival. Damage to the axon of a neuron as a result of primary injury leads to its degeneration disconnection from the post-synaptic neuron. This results in reduced availability of neurotrophic factors leading to eventual degeneration  of the post-synaptic neuron."
"Since secondary injuries evolve over time after the primary injury, they may provide a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord causes loss of sensory and motor function distal to the point of injury. There are approximately 400,000 patients with SCI in the US."
"The leading causes of SCI are motor vehicle accidents, violent acts and sports-related injuries, especially diving accidents. The majority of the victims are typically between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Pathophysiology of SCI."
"The pathophysiology of SCI can be divided into three phases: Primary, secondary and chronic processes. Primary injury results mainly from mechanical damage, while secondary process involves apoptotic cell death, release of growth inhibitory molecules and glial scar formation. Chronic pain syndrome develops usually within several months to years following injury."
This pain profoundly affects the quality of life. Targets for Intervention. The most immediate intervention in SCI treatment is patient stabilization and decompression of the vertebral columns to prevent further trauma.
"An acute treatment recommended by the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study is administration of a high dose of methylprednisolone , a steroid, within eight hours of injury. MP is thought to decrease edema, inflammatory response and/or free radical production. Many axons are demyelinated as result of secondary injury."
Voltage-gated potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine  looks extremely promising in clinical trials. Application of 4-AP blocks potassium channels and partially restores action potential conduction properties. Molecular and genetic strategies may represent new avenues for future clinical trials.
"The following processes have to succeed for recovery of neuronal functions following brain trauma. The auditory pathway consists of multiple stages, from the cochlear nucleus to the auditory cortex. Neurons acting at different stages have different functions and exhibit different response properties."
"It is unclear whether these stages share a common encoding mechanism. We trained an unsupervised deep learning model consisting of alternating sparse coding and max pooling layers on cochleogram-filtered human speech. Evaluation of the response properties revealed that computing units in lower layers exhibited spectro-temporal receptive fields  similar to those of inferior colliculus neurons measured in physiological experiments, including properties such as sound onset and termination, checkerboard pattern, and spectral motion."
"Units in upper layers tended to be tuned to phonetic features such as plosivity and nasality, resembling the results of field recording in human auditory cortex. Variation of the sparseness level of the units in each higher layer revealed a positive correlation between the sparseness level and the strength of phonetic feature encoding. The activities of the units in the top layer, but not other layers, correlated with the dynamics of the first two formants  of all phonemes, indicating the encoding of phoneme dynamics in these units."
"These results suggest that the principles of sparse coding and max pooling may be universal in the human auditory pathway. When speech enters the ear, it is subjected to a series of processing stages prior to arriving at the auditory cortex. Neurons acting at different processing stages have different response properties."
"For example, at the auditory midbrain, a neuron may specifically detect the onsets of a frequency component in the speech, whereas in the auditory cortex, a neuron may specifically detect phonetic features. The encoding mechanisms underlying these neuronal functions remain unclear. To address this issue, we designed a hierarchical sparse coding model, inspired by the sparse activity of neurons in the sensory system, to learn features in speech signals."
"We found that the computing units in different layers exhibited hierarchical extraction of speech sound features, similar to those of neurons in the auditory midbrain and auditory cortex, although the computational principles in these layers were the same. The results suggest that sparse coding and max pooling represent universal computational principles throughout the auditory pathway. Hearing is supported by a series of interconnected brain areas, collectively called the central auditory system or auditory pathway [1]."
"This pathway is thought to function as a series of hierarchical processing stages that encode features ranging from simple acoustic features and elementary time–frequency representations in the cochlea and inferior colliculus to complex phonetic features, phonemes, syllables, words, and grammatical features in the auditory cortex [2–8]. However, it remains unclear how neurons encode these distinctive features, especially at higher stages. The encoding mechanisms of neurons in the auditory pathway have been addressed in many studies, and various encoding mechanisms have been proposed."
"These include spatial coding in the cochlea [9–11], spatial coding and temporal coding in the inferior colliculus [12–16], and spatial coding and periodicity coding in the auditory cortex [17–19]. However, these studies only describe the experimental data, and do not explain why the experiments yield specific outcomes. A notable exception is the sparse coding model, which assumes that neurons encode external stimuli using sparse codes."
"The model was originally proposed to explain the properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex [20, 21], but has been extended to explain the emergence of the response properties of auditory nerve fibers [22] and inferior colliculus neurons [23]. Another exception is a deep learning model that has been used to explain the emergence of response properties of neurons to speech in the auditory cortex [24]. Because the model was trained to recognize 40 English phonemes in a supervised fashion, high discrimination ability is critical for its success."
"These two models effectively explained certain neural response properties at different stages along the auditory pathway; however, their underlying computational principles are different. A fundamental question is whether the auditory system uses the same or different principles at different stages. We explored the former possibility in this study."
"Our initial assumption was that sparse coding plays an important role in shaping neural response properties along the auditory pathway. Support for this is provided by the ubiquitous sparse firing of neurons in the auditory pathway [25–27], and sparse coding computational models have effectively interpreted experimental data recorded at certain stages of the auditory system [22, 23]. We extended this model to multiple layers by introducing spatial pooling after each layer, resulting in an unsupervised deep learning model, which we named sparse HMAX  [28]."
"We studied the response properties of the computing units, called artificial neurons, in the model. After training the model on the cochleogram of speech, the spectrotemporal receptive fields  of artificial neurons in lower layers in the model exhibited patterns similar to those of neurons in the inferior colliculus, whereas the responses of artificial neurons in the upper layers resembled the results of field recordings in human auditory cortex. The agreement between the model and neural data suggest that, although the features encoded at different levels of the auditory pathway differ, the encoding mechanisms are similar."
"A hierarchical sparse coding model, SHMAX [28], was trained on the cochleogram of English speech, which consisted of six S layers and six C layers in alternation . The S layers perform sparse coding and the C layers perform max pooling to integrate feature specificity and invariance, respectively, both of which are important for recognition. Each layer has multiple feature maps , and each feature map consists of the responses of artificial neurons with the same receptive field shape but different displacements in the input space."
"In the model, the number of feature maps increases from 100 in layers S1 and C1 to 500 in layers S6 and C6. This setting does not reflect biological facts, but is intended simply to balance the computing resource consumption in different layers because the feature maps are larger in lower layers and smaller in higher layers. The results obtained with other settings would be similar to those presented here if the number of feature maps in each layer was large enough."
"We hypothesized that lower layers correspond to lower-level stages in the auditory pathway such as the inferior colliculus, whereas higher layers correspond to higher-level stages such as the auditory cortex. We compared the response properties of the artificial neurons in different layers to those of real neurons in the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. We first confirmed that the computing units in lower layers of the model could capture the firing properties of the inferior colliculus neurons in the auditory midbrain."
"This capability has been proven in a single-layer sparse coding model [23]; however, the time window of the bases in that model was too large , and it was unclear whether a much smaller time window such as 20 ms, which is more compatible with physiological data [29, 30], would yield similar results. In addition, an overly large time window in the first layer causes difficulty in constructing deep models so that the time windows of higher-layer units agree with those of cortical neurons. Our model started with a time window of 10 ms in layer S1 and ended with a time window of 194 ms in layer C6."
"In the following, we will show that, with these settings, several lower layers of the model, rather than only the lowest layer, can generate results qualitatively similar to those obtained in the previous study [23]. The response properties of an inferior colliculus neuron are usually delineated by STRFs, which are obtained by averaging the spectro-temporal structure of acoustic stimuli before a spike is fired [31]. The STRFs of the S1 units can be approximated by the bases used to reconstruct the stimuli [23]."
"To visualize the STRFs of higher-level units, we linearly combined the bases of units in previous layers . Several example STRFs of units in the first three S layers are shown in Fig 2B–2D, and the full results are shown in S2 Fig. This visualization method is simple, fast, and applicable to lower-layer units."
"In fact, the results are similar to the STRFs obtained by the normalized reverse-correlation method [32, 33] . However, in deeper layers, the STRFs become larger and more complex, and exhibit stronger nonlinearity, and are therefore difficult to capture with a linear method. By visual inspection, all of the first three S layers exhibited a certain degree of agreement with physiological data collected from the inferior colliculus, with layer S2 providing the best match in terms of STRF size and pattern ."
"Representative bases of layer S2 units are visualized in Fig 3. Most layer S2 bases had both excitatory regions and inhibitory regions. Specifically, some units favored excitation first, followed by inhibition at the same frequency ."
"This pattern has been observed in STRFs of inferior colliculus neurons in cats [34]. By contrast, some layer S2 units favored inhibition first, followed by excitation at the same frequency . This pattern has been observed in STRFs of inferior colliculus neurons in gerbils [23, 35]."
"Some layer S2 bases had localized checkerboard patterns in their STRFs , also as in inferior colliculus neurons in gerbils [23, 35]. Some layer S2 units were selective to spectral motion , as in certain inferior colliculus neurons in Mexican free-tailed bat that are tuned to motion cues present in conspecific vocalizations [29]. In those studies, the favored frequencies of layer S2 bases differed from those of inferior colliculus neurons because the experiments were carried out on gerbils and cats, whereas our deep learning model was trained on human speech data with a lower range of frequency content."
"We calculated the distributions of four parameters that characterized a STRF over all layer S1, S2, and S3 units, separately: best temporal modulation frequency , response duration , center frequency , and spectral bandwidth . Fig 4A– 4D shows the results of layer S2 units. The shapes of the distributions of layer S2 units were most similar to those of inferior colliculus neurons in cats [30] ."
"The scatterplot of Best T and spectral modulation  indicated a tradeoff between the temporal modulation and spectral modulation among layer S2 units; i. e. , units with both high temporal modulation  and spectral modulation were scarce."
This result agrees with observations made in inferior colliculus neurons of cats [34]. We hypothesized that the higher layers in the network would correspond to the auditory cortex. A previous study using cortical surface recordings in humans reported selectivity for distinct English phonetic features at single electrodes [6].
"Hence, we investigated whether similar results could be obtained in higher layers of our network. Following that study [6], we separately calculated the phoneme selectivity index  vectors of the units in layers S1 to C6 . Each element in the PSI vector of a unit indicates the selectivity of the unit to a phoneme; the larger the element, the more selective to the corresponding phoneme."
"Units in lower layers, such as S1 to S4, did not exhibit distinctive phoneme selectivity , whereas those in higher layers did . As an example, Fig 5A shows the PSI vectors of 173 active units in layer C6 whose responses to randomly selected time frames were statistically larger than their response to silence . Each of these units exhibits strong selectivity for a subset of phonemes, and the unit–phoneme map exhibits a strong clustering effect."
"We used hierarchical agglomerative clustering analyses [36] with Euclidean distance to determine selectivity patterns across phonemes  and active units . Phonemes were clustered into six groups according to the place and manner of articulation: plosive, fricative, low back, low front, high front, and nasal. The active units were also clustered into six groups, each selective for one of the six types of phonemes."
"The PSI vectors of active units sharing a particular phonetic feature were averaged to quantify the feature selectivity of these units. Six groups of units exhibited distinctive roles in characterizing these features . Similar clustering results were obtained in layers S5, C5, and S6 ."
"However, the dark area in the unit–phoneme plane becomes increasingly prominent from layer S5 to layer C6 , suggesting increasing selectivity of these layers for phonetic features. As in previous studies [24, 37], we defined an index  that measures the overall selectivity of each hidden layer to phonetic features . We found that the deeper the layer, the higher the F-ratio ."
"Specifically, the active units in layer C6 exhibited the highest overall selectivity. Phonetic feature categories are discrete acoustic parameters. We next investigated the encoding of continuous acoustic features that specify phonemes, including the fundamental frequency , formant frequencies , voice-onset time , and spectral peak."
"We used linear regression to decode these features from the response amplitudes of model units . Because F0, F1, and F2 vary significantly across vowels, whereas VOT and spectral peak vary significantly across consonants, we separately decoded F0, F1, and F2 of vowels  and the VOT and spectral peak of consonants  from the responses of all active units in layer C6. A 20-fold validation scheme was used to predict each parameter."
The prediction accuracies on the test sets  were defined based on the regression errors on the corresponding training sets . The prediction accuracies for each parameter were significantly higher than those of a random decoder . These observations suggest that the variability of these acoustic features is well represented in the responses of the units.
"Similar prediction accuracies were obtained based on the neural population responses in human superior temporal gyrus [6]. The same linear regression method was applied to decode the acoustic parameters F0, F1, F2, VOT, and spectral peak from the cochleogram. We cut a length of 170 ms cochleogram for each phoneme instance and used it as the feature of this instance."
"All decoding accuracies were about 10%, much lower than those obtained from the responses of layer C6 units . In higher layers of the model, the units were always clustered into six phoneme groups according to PSI . Therefore, we could calculate the decoding accuracies for each group of units and compare the results in different layers."
"In layer C6, we obtained significantly higher accuracies than did a random decoder  . Similar results were obtained in layer S6 . However, the decoding accuracies were very low in layers S5 and C5, and even lower in the earlier layers S4 and C4."
"These poor accuracies were partly due to the small STRFs of units in these layers, which contain less information about the acoustic features of a phoneme. Fig 6D shows a small improvement from layer S to layer C, but a large improvement from layer C to layer S. This is because STRF sizes were similar between units in layer S and layer C, but very different between units in layer C and layer S ."
"Thus far, we have described the encoding of static acoustic features of phonemes in higher layers of the model. However, phonemes are not static. In fact, the first two formants  of the phonemes, especially the consonants, exhibited large variation over time ."
"We investigated the encoding of the dynamic formants using the responses of the units. We defined the temporal variation index  of individual phonemes as the projections of their F1 or F2 contours  onto their respective principal components over all phonemes . Therefore, TVI measures the matching degree of an individual formant contour to the principal component of all formant contours."
"For each unit, we calculated the correlations between its responses to phonemes and the TVIs of the phonemes. A high correlation indicated that the unit was sensitive to the TVI of the phonemes—it “liked” phonemes whose F1 or F2 contour were congruent to the principal component but “disliked” phonemes whose F1 or F2 contour were incongruent to the principal component. Some units in layer C6 were sensitive to either F1 or F2 TVI, whereas others were sensitive to both F1 and F2 TVI ."
"However, such units were scarce in layers S5, C5, and S6; in fact, for most of the units in these layers, the correlations between their responses and both F1 and F2 TVI were smaller than 0. 5. The hallmark of the sparse coding model [20, 38] is the sparse activity of the hidden units, which has been proven to be essential in reproducing the tuning properties of auditory nerve fibers [22] and neurons in the inferior colliculus [23]."
"However, it remains unclear whether sparse activity in higher layers of SHMAX also plays a significant role in producing the phoneme encodings that we observed. Hence, we investigated how the sparseness level influenced the results in layer S5 to layer C6. First, we adjusted the parameter λ in the sparse coding model, which controls the sparseness of the responses of the units of a particular S layer, while keeping λ in other layers at the default value of 1."
"We found that sparseness and F-ratio were positively correlated in each layer , i. e. , the sparser the activity, the more selective the units."
"However, increasing the sparseness level in lower layers such as S5 and C5 did not lead to phoneme tuning as strong as that in C6. This suggests that sparseness was not the only factor that led to the strong phoneme- encoding property in the top layer, and that the hierarchical structure also played a significant role. Although we used the lifetime sparseness measure [39]  here, the conclusion did not change when the population sparseness measure [40] was applied."
"Second, we modulated the neural encoding of acoustic parameters with different sparseness levels. The results revealed that sparseness also played a key role in producing the neural population coding of acoustic parameters . The other critical element in the model is max pooling."
"Without this element, the model would be almost linear because the only nonlinear operation is the down-sampling between layer S1 and layer S2, which is implemented by a convolution with stride 2; one would not expect such a model to produce striking results. To examine the influence of pooling, first, we removed the max pooling layers and trained the model as before. Under these conditions, the STRFs of layer S2 and layer S3 units exhibited much simpler patterns , and the complex patterns obtained with max pooling  were scarce."
"More importantly, the higher layers did not exhibit similar results to those of field recordings in human auditory cortex . Second, we replaced all max pooling in the model with average pooling, another widely used operation in the deep learning field. The only difference is that, in average pooling, we take the average of values, instead of the maximum value, in a region."
"After training the model, we obtained poor results . These results suggest that max pooling played an important role in modeling the function of the auditory pathway. In addition to sparse response and max pooling, two other factors are also important for the emergence of phoneme selectivity: the number of layers and STRF size of the units."
"This is because enough nonlinearity must be accumulated along the hierarchy through repeated max pooling and down-sampling, and the STRF must be large enough to cover the length of the phonemes. To better understand the roles of these two factors, we explored models with different architectures. First, we tried a different layer S5 with larger kernel size , whose STRF size was the same as in the original layer S6."
"The selectivity of the new layer S5 was weaker than that of the original layer S6 . Because the nonlinearity of the model grows with ascending layers, this result indicates that the emergence of phoneme selectivity needs a certain degree of nonlinearity. Second, we replaced the original layer S6  with two new layers, S6 and S7, with kernel size 5×5."
"In comparison with the original layer S6, the phoneme selectivity of the new layer S6 was weaker, and that of the new layer S7 was similar . The results indicate that STRF size is also important for the emergence of phoneme selectivity. Notice that there is an abrupt increase in the decoding accuracy of acoustic parameters from original layer S5 to layer S6, as observed in Fig 6D."
"This is mainly because the STRFs of layer S5 units were not large enough to capture the selectivity information, while those of layer S6 units happened to be large enough. Fig 10 shows that, if the STRF size in original layer S5 is increased , or the STRF size in original layer S6 is decreased , the increase in decoding accuracy from the original layer S5 to layer S6 would not be as large as observed in Fig 6D. In this study, we demonstrated the capability of a computational model to predict the neural response properties along the auditory pathway."
"With alternating sparse coding and max pooling operations, the model learned important features of speech, from simple spectro-temporal patterns to complex phonetic features, which are encoded at different stages of the auditory pathway. Specifically, the response properties of lower-layer units were similar to those of inferior colliculus neurons in the auditory midbrain, whereas the response properties of higher layers were similar to field recordings in the auditory cortex. It is worth emphasizing that the agreement between the model output and neural physiological data is not a result of neural data fitting, but rather of unsupervised learning of the deep network."
"Because the auditory system deals with dynamic sound stimulus and has more processing stages before the auditory cortex, its coding strategy was thought to be distinct from that of the visual system [41]. Our model demonstrated for the first time that the sparse and hierarchical coding strategies widely observed in the visual system can also be generalized to the auditory system. A previous study [23] using a single-layer sparse coding model reported qualitatively similar results to those obtained from the lower layers of SHMAX."
"The work described here extends that study in two ways: first, by setting a more biologically reasonable temporal window for learning the response properties of inferior colliculus neurons in auditory midbrain; and second, by introducing hierarchical structure for learning the results of field recording in the auditory cortex. By using control experiments, we have found that max pooling in the hierarchical structure also plays an important role in producing the results. Because the same principles, sparse coding and max pooling, are employed in different layers of the model, the results suggest that these principles might underlie computation at multiple stages of the auditory system."
"This is in agreement with the assumption that the auditory system evolved to optimize the representation of natural sounds [42], of which human speech is an example. Natural sounds contain many forms of higher-order and nonlinear statistical regularities [22, 42, 43], and sparse coding and max pooling are capable of extracting such regularities from natural images [28, 44, 45]. In this work, we demonstrate that these approaches can also extract them from human speech."
"Psychological studies have reported that infants are capable of distinguishing phonemes in their native language, even though they are not explicitly trained to accomplish this task [46, 47]. Inspired by this finding, many computational models have been proposed to investigate how phoneme categories can be formed from continuous speech through unsupervised learning . However, these single-layer models cannot reveal how phoneme information is encoded gradually along the auditory pathway."
"Aided by some side information, such as lexical information and the identity of the speaker, deep neural networks can learn phonetic features from speech [51, 52]. A critical step in these systems is time alignment of frames, which complicates the learning process and makes it hard to interpret the learning process of infants. Recently, two hierarchical models, the deep belief network and auto-encoder network, were trained on unlabeled speech corpus, but failed to obtain increasing phoneme selectivity in ascending layers [37]."
"By contrast, after supervised training with phoneme labels, the multilayer perceptron exhibited increasing selectivity to phoneme classes in higher layers [37], and its top layer exhibited a feature organization pattern similar to that of human auditory cortex [24]. Nevertheless, this supervised learning model cannot explain how phoneme representation in the human brain is developed during infancy. In this study, we showed that phonetic feature representation can emerge in an unsupervised learning model trained on continuous speech data without relying on any side information."
"Our results oppose the view that phoneme learning occurs after [51, 52] or concurrent with lexical learning and that the two processes cannot be addressed in isolation [53–55]. The model makes two predictions that could be explored in future experiments. The first is that the emergence of selectivity for phoneme features along the auditory pathway is not abrupt; instead, it should be a continuous process."
"In our model, the selectivity emerged in several layers other than the top layer, although it was weaker in lower layers such as S5. Therefore, one may find neurons selective for phoneme features in subcortical areas, but their selectivity should not be as strong as in the auditory cortex. The second prediction is that there exist neurons in the auditory cortex that encode the formant dynamics of phonemes."
"As shown in Fig 7, some layer C6 units in the model were sensitive to variation in the first formant of the phonemes, the second formant, or both. This is parallel to the findings in the higherlevel cortical areas in the visual pathway, in which neurons encode abstract features such as contours [56, 57]. The fact that such units were scarce in layers S5 to C5 suggests that neurons whose responses are correlated to formant dynamics are not common in subcortical areas."
"This study has some limitations. First, because SHMAX is not a biologically detailed model, it is unclear how it could be implemented in a biological system. Some neural circuits have been proposed to individually realize the two essential components of the model, i."
"e. , sparse coding [58] and max pooling [59, 60], but an approach for integrating them as a whole is still lacking. Second, this model differs from biological systems in many aspects."
"For example, real neurons can be excitatory or inhibitory, and they obey Dale’s law [61], but these features are not considered in SHMAX. In addition, the auditory system contains abundant feedback and recurrent connections, whereas SHMAX is a feedforward model. Due to these differences, the results in this paper should be interpreted cautiously."
"Although such discrepancies may not affect the abstract computational principles of the auditory system revealed by the model, a more biologically plausible model would make the results more convincing. Speech stimuli from the Texas Instruments/Massachusetts Institute of Technology  database [62], which includes 6,300 sentences spoken by 630 speakers  from eight major dialect regions of the United States, were used. The sample rate is 16 kHz."
"The sentences were first converted into cochleogram [9, 63], which is similar to a spectrogram but better reflects the effects of the cochlea. A total of 194 frequency filters were generated from a cochlear model [9] whose center frequencies were between 73 and 7,630 Hz. The sample step was 1 ms."
The cochleogram was used as the input for the SHMAX model. The STRFs of the units in layer S1 were approximated by the corresponding bases. The STRFs of the units in higher layers were obtained by linearly combining the bases of the units in previous layers [28].
"The logic is that a unit in the current layer is locally connected to the units in the previous layer, and the favorite input pattern  of this unit depends on the favorite input patterns of the units in the previous layer. One can also calculate STRFs of units in any S layer directly, without precomputing the STRFs of units in lower S layers . This is equivalent to the bottom-up method , except for some differences in the boundaries of STRFs."
"The latter method was used to visualize the STRFs of S units in this study. Since a C unit takes the maximum response of four neighboring units in the preceding S layer  whose STRFs are the same, its STRF is very similar to the STRFs of the preceding S units except that it is a bit larger. Its size is jointly determined by the size of the STRFs of the four preceding S units and the shifts between them."
"The STRF sizes of the units in each layer are shown in Table 2. Because all STRFs are assumed to be square, only the side lengths are shown in the table. To test the validity of the visualization method described above, the STRFPak toolbox with the normalized reverse-correlation method [32, 33] was also used to calculate the STRFs of the units in layers S1, S2, and S3 ; this took much longer time than the linear combination method described above."
"The time lag used for calculating the stimulus auto-correlation was 200 ms, the tolerance value was 0. 01, and the sparse parameter was 0. The overall mean firing rate was removed from the neuronal response, and the space-time non-separable algorithm was used."
"To compare the model and experimental results [30, 34], singular value decomposition  was performed on the obtained STRFs, and the two unitary vectors corresponding to the first singular value were used to quantify the spectral and temporal response characteristics, namely the spectral and temporal profiles  [30]. The peaks of the spectral and temporal profiles determine the center frequency  and best temporal modulation frequency  respectively. The widths of the spectral and temporal profile that account for 90% of the total energy determine the bandwidth and the duration respectively."
"To calculate the responses of a computing unit to a particular phoneme in speech, the TIMIT phonetic transcriptions were used to align responses to the onsets of all instances of the phoneme. Phoneme length was not normalized. The maximum absolute value of the response of a unit along the phoneme duration was defined as that unit’s response amplitude."
"The PSI vectors [6] were employed to characterize the selectivity of the units to phonemes. The method is briefly outlined as follows, and more details can be found in Ref. [6]."
"For every unit, the distribution of its response amplitudes across all samples of each phoneme was estimated first. To calculate a unit’s PSI for a particular phoneme, the non-parametric Wilcox rank-sum test was used to determine whether the response amplitude distribution of the phoneme had a larger median than those of other phonemes . The number of phonemes whose median response amplitudes were statistically smaller than the median response amplitude of a particular phoneme was defined as the unit’s PSI for that phoneme."
"Because 33 phonemes were selected from the dataset, PSI ranges between 0 and 32, where 0 means no selectivity and 32 means extreme selectivity. The PSIs for all 33 phonemes form a 33-dimensional PSI vector for the unit. Six distinctive features were used to describe the acoustic properties of each phoneme [68]."
"Each phoneme has only one of the six features. The PSI vectors of all phonemes that shared a particular feature were averaged to describe the feature selectivity of the units . A series of static acoustic parameters were estimated for phonemes that play a perceptually important role in speech perception, including F0, F1, F2, VOT, and spectral peak."
The values of the first three parameters were calculated as the median value of transcribed boundaries over the duration of the phoneme [6]. The VOT was extracted as the phoneme transcription boundary. The spectral peak was defined as the maximum energy along the frequency axis in the cochleogram.
"Acoustic parameters differ among individual instances of a phoneme; therefore, each acoustic parameter for each phoneme in the dataset is expressed as a distribution. Similar to [6], a linear model y = wx + b was used to regress the static acoustic parameters y such as the fundamental frequency , formant frequencies , voice-onset time , and spectral peak, based on the response amplitudes of the computing units x, where w and b are parameters to be learned. The least-square error between the prediction y and the ground truth y� was minimized on a training set, and the trained model predicted the parameter values on a test set."
The root-mean-squared error was calculated on the training set. A prediction for a test sample was regarded as “correct” if the prediction error was smaller than the root-mean-squared error. The percent of correct prediction on the test set was defined as the testing or decoding accuracy.
"The acoustic parameters regressed were F0, F1, and F2 of vowels and VOT and spectral peak of consonants. Fig 6A and 6B presents the decoding results using the responses of all active units in layer C6. Fig 6C and 6D presents the decoding results using the responses of active units, in each of the six phoneme groups separately, in different layers."
"For each task, a 20-fold cross-validation scheme was adopted, and therefore 20 decoding accuracies were obtained. To conduct a significance test, a random decoder was constructed. Given a test sample, the decoder output a value between the minimum and maximum values of the ground truth on the training samples, with a uniform probability."
This random prediction was evaluated as correct or not based on the same criterion used for linear prediction. The 20-fold cross-validation scheme resulted in 20 chance-level accuracies. Student’s t-test was performed to compare the two sets of accuracies.
"The time course of the first formant frequency of a phoneme instance was called the F1 contour of that instance . The averaged F1 contours over all instances of a phoneme was defined as the F1 contour of the phoneme. Since 33 phonemes were selected in the dataset, we obtained 33 F1 contours."
"Principal component analysis  was performed on these contours. The first principal component, which had the same length as the F1 contour, was calculated . The projection of the F1 contour of each phoneme onto the first principal component  was defined as the F1 temporal variation index  of that phoneme."
A unit’s average response to all instances of a phoneme  was defined as its response to that phoneme. The encoding of F1 dynamics in a unit was measured as the correlation between the unit’s responses to all of the 33 phonemes and the F1 TVIs of those phonemes. The same procedure was applied to measure the encoding of F2 dynamics in a unit.
"Extensive synaptic connectivity is a hallmark of neural circuitry. For example, a typical neuron in themammalian neocortex receives thousands of synaptic inputs. Network models allow us to explore the computational potential of such connectivity, using both analysis and simulations."
"As illustrations, we study in this chapter how networks can perform the following tasks: coordinate transformations needed in visually guided reaching, selective ampliÞcation leading to models of simple and complex cells in primary visual cortex, integration as a model of short-term memory, noise reduction, input selection, gain modulation, and associative memory. Networks that undergo oscillations are also analyzed, with application to the olfactory bulb. Finally, we discuss network models based on stochastic rather than deterministic dynamics, using the Boltzmann machine as an example."
"Neocortical circuits are a major focus of our discussion. In the neocortex, which forms the convoluted outer surface of the  human brain, neurons lie in six vertical layers highly coupled within cylindrical columns. Such columns have been suggested as basic functional units,  and stereotypical patterns of connections both within a column and between columns are repeated across cortex."
"There are three main classes of interconnections within cortex, and in other areas of the brain as well. Feedforward connections bring input to a given region from another re- f gion located at an earlier stage along a particular processing pathway. Recurrent synapses interconnect neurons within a particular region that are considered to be at the same stage along the processing pathway."
These may include connections within a cortical column as well as connections between both nearby and distant cortical columns within a region. Topdown connections carry signals back from areas located at later stages. These deÞnitions depend on the how the region being studied is speciÞed and on the hierarchical assignment of regions along a pathway.
"In general, neurons within a given region send top-down projections back to the areas from which they receive feedforward input, and receive top-down input from the areas to which they project feedforward output. The numbers, though not necessarily the strengths, of feedforward and top-down Þbers between connected regions are typically comparable, and recurrent synapses typically outnumber feedforward or top-down inputs. We begin this chapter by studying networks with purely feedforward input and then study the effects of recurrent connections."
"The analysis of top-down connections, for which it is more difÞcult to establish clear computational roles, is left until chapter 10. Themost direct way to simulate neural networks is to use themethods discussed in chapters 5 and 6 to synaptically connect model spiking neurons. This is a worthwhile and instructive enterprise, but it presents signiÞcant computational, calculational, and interpretational challenges."
"In this chapter, we follow a simpler approach and construct networks of neuron-like units with outputs consisting of Þring rates rather than action potentials. Spiking models involve dynamics over time scales ranging from channel openings that can take less than a millisecond, to collective network processes that may be several orders of magnitude slower. Firing-rate models avoid the short time scale dynamics required to simulate action potentials and thus are much easier to simulate on computers."
"Firing-rate models also allow us to present analytic calculations of some aspects of network dynamics that could not be treated in the case of spiking neurons. Finally, spiking models tend to havemore free parameters than Þring-ratemodels, and setting these appropriately can be difÞcult. There are two additional arguments in favor of Þring-rate models."
The Þrst concerns the apparent stochasticity of spiking. The models discussed in chapters 5 and 6 produce spike sequences deterministically in response to injected current or synaptic input. Deterministic models can predict spike sequences accurately only if all their inputs are known.
"This is unlikely to be the case for the neurons in a complex network, and network models typically include only a subset of the many different inputs to individual neurons. Therefore, the greater apparent precision of spiking models may not actually be realized in practice. If necessary, Þring-ratemodels can be used to generate stochastic spike sequences from a deterministically computed rate, using the methods discussed in chapters 1 and 2."
"The second argument involves a complication with spiking models that arises when they are used to construct simpliÞed networks. Although cortical neurons receive many inputs, the probability of Þnding a synaptic connection between a randomly chosen pair of neurons is actually quite low. Capturing this feature, while retaining a high degree of connectivity through polysynaptic pathways, requires including a large number of neurons in a network model."
"A standard way of dealing with this problem is to use a single model unit to represent the average response of several neurons that have similar selectivities. These averaging units can then be interconnected more densely than the individual neurons of the actual network, so fewer of them are needed to build the model. If neural responses are characterized by Þring rates, the output of the model unit is simply the average of the Þring rates of the neurons it represents collectively."
"However, if the response is a spike, it is not clear how the spikes of the represented neurons can be averaged. The way spiking models are typically constructed, an action potential Þred by the model unit duplicates the effect of all the neurons it represents Þring synchronously. Not surprisingly, such models tend to exhibit large-scale synchronization unlike anything seen in a healthy brain."
"Firing-rate models also have their limitations. They cannot account for aspects of spike timing and spike correlations that may be important for understanding nervous system function. Firing-rate models are restricted to cases where the Þring of neurons in a network is uncorrelated, with little synchronous Þring, and where precise patterns of spike timing are unimportant."
"In such cases, comparisons of spiking network models with models that use Þring-rate descriptions have shown that they produce similar results. Nevertheless, the exploration of neural networks undoubtedly requires the use of both Þring-rate and spiking models. The Þring-rate models described by equations 7."
"6 and 7. 8 differ in their assumptions about how Þring rates respond to and track changes in the input current to a neuron. In one case , it is assumed that Þring rates follow time-varying input currents instantaneously, without attenuation or delay."
"In the other case , the Þring rate is a low-pass Þltered version of the input current. To study the relationship between input current and Þring rate, it is useful to examine the Þring rate of a spiking model neuron in response to a time-varying injected current, I. The model used for this purpose in Þgure 7."
"2 is an integrate-and-Þre neuron receiving balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input along with a current injected into the soma that is the sum of constant and oscillating components. This model was discussed in chapter 5. The balanced synaptic input is used to represent background input not included in the computation of Is, and it acts as a source of noise."
"The noise prevents effects, such as locking of the spiking to the oscillations of the injected current, that would invalidate a Þring-rate description. The functional properties of neurons in the primary visual cortex  are thought to be closely related to the structural properties of this network, but the specific relationships remain unclear. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that sparse coding, an energy-efficient coding method, might underlie the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons."
We thus aimed to delineate how the neurons are wired to produce this feature. We constructed a model and endowed it with a simple Hebbian learning rule to encode images of natural scenes. The excitatory neurons fired sparsely in response to images and developed strong orientation selectivity.
"After learning, the connectivity between excitatory neuron pairs, inhibitory neuron pairs, and excitatory-inhibitory neuron pairs depended on firing pattern and receptive field similarity between the neurons. The receptive fields  of excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons were well predicted by the RFs of presynaptic excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, respectively. The excitatory neurons formed a small-world network, in which certain local connection patterns were significantly overrepresented."
"Bidirectionally manipulating the firing rates of inhibitory neurons caused linear transformations of the firing rates of excitatory neurons, and vice versa. These wiring properties and modulatory effects were congruent with a wide variety of data measured in V1, suggesting that the sparse coding principle might underlie both the functional and wiring properties of V1 neurons. Revealing the functional properties of visual neurons and their wiring pattern is key to understanding the working mechanisms of the visual system."
"One of the greatest discoveries about the functions of neurons in the mammalian primary visual cortex  comes from Hubel andWiesel’s experiments in which a large portion of them were found to be orientation or direction selective . This has been attributed to the sparse activity of neurons in response to visual stimuli . Over the past 20 years, technical advances have enabled researchers to probe the topology of the networks formed by V1 neurons."
"We now know that the wiring pattern of layer 2/3 neurons in the rodent V1 is highly nonrandom . For instance, the connection probability between two pyramidal  excitatory neurons depends on their preferred orientation difference , and the connection strength between two PYR neurons correlates with their response similarity and receptive field  similarity . However, it remains unclear how these wiring properties emerge and how they are related to the functions of neurons."
"To address these unanswered questions, it would be helpful to have a simple, biologically plausible, and sensitive learning model that is based on few assumptions and is capable of unifying previous data while predicting new connectivity patterns. As a preliminary requirement, such a model should incorporate the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons. Sparse coding models  and related independent component analysis models  are able to replicate this functional property."
"They often have a two-layer structure where the first layer contains visible units corresponding to image pixels and the second layer contains latent units corresponding to V1 neurons. Some of these models either do not consider the dependence between latent units  or do not model the dependence by explicit connections , which makes it impossible to compare the models with cortical circuits in terms of structure. A nonfactorial sparse coding model  considers lateral connections between neurons, but the model lacks biological plausibility."
"Amore biologically plausible model assuming lateral connections between neurons refers to the locally competitive network  . Acombination of Hebb rule and anti-Hebb rule can be used by theLCNto learn the oriented bar-like RFs of V1 neurons . A spiking model equipped with local plasticity rules, named SAILnet  was shown to be able to not only replicate the bar-like RFs of V1 neurons but also log-normal-like distributions of inhibitory connection weight between excitatory neurons."
"Similar distributions of synaptic efficacy have been observed in the brain . The aforementioned models do not differentiate between excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. Some excitatory-inhibitory models  have been shown to be able to replicate either the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons or wiring features of cortical neuron—for example, log-normal-like distribution of the connection strength  and network motifs  among PYR neurons, but not both."
"We are aware of only one excitatory-inhibitory model  that related the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons to their connectivity by taking structured visual input. But in that study, only the connections between excitatory-inhibitory pairs were analyzed with respect to the RFs of neurons. In addition, the model assumes no lateral connections between excitatory neurons and therefore cannot be used directly to study the wiring features among excitatory neurons reported in animal studies ."
"In fact, many computational studies, including most of those already noted , do not assume existence and plasticity of all types of connections: excitatory-to-excitatory , excitatory-to-inhibitory , inhibitory-to-excitatory , and inhibitory-to-inhibitory  connections. It is yet to be known if the wiring features of V1 neurons could emerge in a fully learnable model. We extended the LCN  into an excitatory–inhibitory network  and adopted the Hebb rule  to learn all types of connections given natural images as stimuli."
"The model replicated numerous wiring properties of V1 neurons discovered in recent years and made many interesting predictions that can now be tested experimentally. connection strengths from excitatory neurons to inhibitory neurons and from inhibitory neurons to excitatory neurons are similar  Fifth, the connection probability, calculated as the number of detected connections divided by the number of potential connections assayed, between excitatory neuronswas about 20% and the connection probability fromexcitatory neurons to inhibitory neurons was about 90% . Starting from these assumptions, we constructed a network consisting of 1000 excitatory neurons and 250 inhibitory neurons ."
"The dynamic equations of the neurons are where zE and zI denote the membrane potentials of the excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, respectively; rE and rI denote the firing rates of excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, respectively; x denotes visual stimuli ; and c denotes input from other brain areas. The firing rates rE and rI are determined by the activation functions f E and f I, respectively . MPQ denotes the lateral connections from neuron set Q to neuron set P ; P and Q can take two values, E and I, denoting excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, respectively."
"WE and WI denote the feedforward connections from visual stimuli x to excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, respectively . Therefore, each row of WE denotes the RF of an excitatory neuron, and each row ofWI denotes the RF of an inhibitory neuron. All elements inMPQ are constrained to be nonnegative, whereas the elements inWE andWI do not have this constraint."
"It is possible to model the neural projection from the lateral geniculate nucleus to V1 and separate WE and WI into matrices with nonnegative elements, but that is not the focus of this study. The time constants τE and τI govern the evolving speeds of zE and zI, respectively. Given the stimuli x and external input c, the states of the neurons evolve over time according to equations 2."
"1 and 2. 2 . Throughout this letter, the characters in bold denote vectors or matrices, and the letters in plain type denote scalars."
"By distinguishing excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, the two equations are essentially in the form of LCN . This form can trace back to the continuous Hopfield network . In biologically detailed neuronal models, the synaptic inputs zE, zI, and c usually denote potential, but here for convenience we assume that they have been multiplied by a constant to convert potential to firing rate and are therefore measured in units of Hz ."
"This makes the synaptic weights dimensionless. Note that this view does not imply that zE, zI, and c could only be nonnegative. The neurons start to fire when the inputs exceed certain thresholds ."
"Specifically, the activation functions for the excitatory and inhibitory neurons are defined. In a biological system, connected neurons can become disconnected when the synapses are weak. To simulate the process, one could use a small threshold to prune all connections whose strengths are below it ."
"But that would only prune the E-to-E connections because the other three types of lateral connections should be much stronger according to physiological data  and therefore would not be affected. A better strategy is to define a probability function depending on the connection strength w for randomly dropping connections. Three nonincreasing probability functions p were tested, called one-over-w, sigmoid and piecewise-linear  The parameters of the functions were set such that after convergence of the learning algorithm, the probability of connection between excitatory neurons was about 20% and the probability of connection fromexcitatory neurons to inhibitory neurons was about 90% according to experimental observations in layer 2/3 of rodents’ V1 area ."
"We empirically found that to satisfy the above conditions, p should first decrease quickly to a low probability then stay there or decrease slowly. We did not find qualitatively different results by using different functions or different parameters of a particular function if only the above conditions were satisfied. All results presented in this letter were obtained with p being the one-over-w function unless otherwise specified."
"Without connection dropping, the results presented in this letter, except those depending on disconnections between neurons , did not change significantly. Overall Firing and Connection Patterns. The distributions of firing rates of the excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons showed a higher peak at zero and a heavier “tail” than the fitted half-normal distributions , indicating sparseness of the neural activities."
"This was due to the threshold activation functions of the neurons. Consistent with the sparse coding theory , the RFs of the excitatory neurons resembled simple oriented bars, but the RFs of inhibitory neurons were much more complex . Using gratings with different orientations  as the input, we calculated the preferred orientations and the orientation selectivity indexes  of all neurons : 84."
"7% of excitatory neurons had an OSI larger than 0. 8, but 85. 6% of inhibitory neurons had an OSI less than 0."
"4, consistent with physiological data . We attribute these differences to different levels of sparseness in the activity of the excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. Given a set of stimuli, the percentage of active excitatory neurons was approximately 5%, while the percentage of active inhibitory neurons was approximately 35%."
"When inhibitory neurons were made to fire more sparsely, which was achieved by increasing their firing thresholds, many of their RFs also resembled oriented bars . This is consistent with a previous computational study  in which both excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons fired sparsely to image patches and the obtained RFs all resembled oriented bars. Neurons with Similar Responses Form Strong Connections."
"Because the learning rule was based on the Hebb rule, we expected that the strengths of connections between neurons would correlate with their responses to natural images. We therefore calculated the correlation coefficients of responses of pairs of neurons to 100 randomly sampled image patches . The distribution of the coefficients between excitatory neurons was quite sparse, and most coefficients were small ."
"Similar results were also produced in a previous computational model . Excitatory neurons were more likely to be connected if their responses were more similar . In addition, they tended to form strong connections if their response correlation coefficient was large but tended weak connections if the coefficient was small or negative ."
"In fact, 3. 7% of the most correlated Eto- E pairs accounted for 50% of the total strength of all E-to-E connections , highlighting the nonuniform distribution of the connection strengths between excitatory neurons. These results are consistent with experimental data obtained from the mouse V1 ."
"The distributions of the correlation coefficients between excitatoryinhibitory pairs  and between inhibitory pairs  were peaked at points below zero, wider than that between excitatory pairs . The connection probability between excitatory-inhibitory pairs was higher if their responses were positively correlated and lower if their responses were negatively correlated . The I-to-I connection probability was always close to one and had weak dependence on the response correlation ."
"Similar to the E-to-E connections, the I-to-E, E-to-I and I-to-I connections were stronger between neurons with more similar responses . The nonuniformity of the strength distributions was not as high as that of the E-to-E connection strength distribution. The 36."
"6% most correlated I-to-E pairs , 36. 0% most correlated E-to-I pairs  and 33. 2% of most correlated I-to-I pairs  accounted for 50% of the total strength of all I-to-E, E-to-I and I-to-I connections, respectively."
"Taken together, these results indicated that the model neurons, regardless of type, were more strongly connected if their responses were more similar. Neurons with Similar RFs Form Strong Connections. Besides response correlation, RF correlation, quantified using the pixel-to-pixel correlation coefficient between two RFs, can be also used to measure the functional similarity between neurons ."
The distributions of RF correlation coefficients were more symmetric than those of response correlation coefficients . This difference was observed between the two distributions calculated between PYR neurons in mouse V1 . We investigated whether the connection probability and the strength of connections between neurons correlated with the similarity between the RFs of the neurons .
"All the conclusions based on the response similarity were also obtained based on the RF similarity. In fact, 1. 7% of strong E-to-E connections accounted for 50% of the total strength , while considerably larger portions of strong connections of other types  were required to account for 50% of the total strength ."
"Consistent with the results obtained between PYR/PYR pairs in the mouse V1 ,we found that the connections between bidirectionally connected excitatory neuron pairs were stronger than the connections between unidirectionally connected excitatory pairs, and the RFs of bidirectionally connected neuron pairs were more similar than the RFs of unidirectionally connected pairs . We also investigated the relationships between the RFs of postsynaptic neurons and the RFs of presynaptic neurons using the method described in a published physiological study . For each postsynaptic neuron, we calculated the weighted sum of the RFs of all presynaptic excitatory or inhibitory neurons using the corresponding connection strengths as the weighting coefficients and then compared this sum with the actual RF of the postsynaptic neuron."
"The RFs of the excitatory neurons were well predicted by their presynaptic excitatory neurons  but not by the presynaptic inhibitory neurons . The RFs of the inhibitory neurons were predicted by their presynaptic excitatory neurons to some extent  and well predicted by their presynaptic inhibitory neurons . For each neuron, we sorted the presynaptic neurons into descending order of connection strength and then divided them into four quarters."
"In the case of E-to-E connections, the first two quarters of presynaptic neurons accounted for 81. 2% and 14. 0% of the total connection strength on average, and the predicted RFs of the postsynaptic neurons based on these neurons were highly correlated with the actual RF ."
"These findings are consistent with the results obtained between PYR/PYR pairs in themouse V1 . In the cases of E-to-I and I-to-I connections, only the first quarter of presynaptic neurons could predict the RFs of postsynaptic neurons to some extent . In the case of I-to-E connections, none of the quarters of presynaptic neurons could predict the RFs of postsynaptic neurons well ."
"In all four cases, the median correlations decreased with increasing quarter number. Finally, as expected, the unconnected neurons in all four cases failed to predict the RFs of the postsynaptic neurons. These analyses indicate that all neurons in the model with more similar RFs were more strongly connected, and the presynaptic neurons played an important role in shaping the RFs of the postsynaptic neurons."
Excitatory Neurons Form a Small-World Network. The previous analyses suggested that the learned network was not randomly wired. We therefore systematically evaluated the nonrandomness of the network.
"We investigated only the subnetwork consisting of the excitatory neurons, because we aimed to analyze the connectivity pattern, which was meaningful only in a population with sparse connections while the inhibitory neurons were densely connected to each other and to the excitatory neurons. We randomly selected 10,000 small subnets consisting of K excitatory neurons, with K equal to 3 to 8, and then calculated the number of connections between all neurons in each subnet. For comparison, we constructed 100 random networks whose unidirectional and bidirectional connection probabilities matched those of the learned network."
"A higher number of connections in a K-cell subnet tended to be found more frequently in the learned network than in random networks , implying that certain local connection patterns   were significantly overrepresented. The neurons with more similar RFs tended to form overrepresented motifs . Moreover, pairs of neurons tended to share more common neighbors than expected, and with more common neighbors, neurons were more likely to be connected ."
"Similar motif patterns and common neighbor effect were observed among somatosensory neurons of rats . Many types of networks can exhibit the local clustering effect described above. Next,we tested two most common hypotheses in describing nonrandom complex networks: the scale-free network  and small-world network  hypotheses."
"These are global characteristics of complex networks. The hallmark of the scale-free network is that its node degree follows a power-law distribution. In other words, the distribution of the node degree is approximately a straight line with a negative slope in the log-log plane; so is its cumulative distribution ."
"We did not observe this pattern in the distribution of node in-degree, out-degree, or total degree . To test the small-world hypothesis, we converted the excitatory neuronal network into an undirected and unweighted network: if there existed at least one connection between two neurons, they were said to be connected, and the connectionweightwas set to one. The average shortest path length between all pairs of excitatory neurons was 1."
"81 ± 0. 39 , and the average clustering coefficient was 0. 36 ± 0."
"7. For comparison, we constructed a random network with the same number of neurons and connections. This was achieved by randomly shuffling the connections in the undirected and unweighted excitatory neuronal network."
"The average shortest path length in this random network was 1. 81 ± 0. 39, nearly the same as that of the learned network, but the average clustering coefficient was 0."
"18 ± 0. 003, which is much smaller than that of the learned network, indicating the small-worldness of the learned network. Akey question is how this small-world network is wired."
"It is known that a small-world network can be obtained by randomly reconnecting some connections in a ring lattice . In many small-world networks, such as social networks and theWorldWideWeb, it is difficult to visualize this process because it is difficult to arrange the nodes into a ring lattice. In our network, the neurons can be ordered in a ring lattice according to their orientation preferences."
"We generated an example subnetwork consisting of 36 neurons whose preferred orientations increased from 0◦ to 180◦ . The subnetwork exhibited a clustering pattern on neighboring neurons as most of the output weights and input weights of each neuron were between neighboring neurons, though some distant connections were also present. We used a threshold to remove the half of the original weighted connections with the weakest weights and converted the connections to binary; we also observed a prominent clustering effect ."
"But the connections are inhibitory connections between excitatory neurons, which violates Dale’s law. Inhibitory neurons were introduced to resolve this problem . It was reported that the strength of connection between an excitatory-inhibitory neuron pair was correlated with the RF similarity between the two neurons."
"The same prediction was made in our study. However, in that model, excitatory neurons were not directly connected; therefore, the model cannot be used to study the wiring scheme of excitatory neurons about which there were abundant experimental data in recent decades. We extended these two studies by constructing an excitatory-inhibitory model with all four types of lateral connections  and systematically analyzed the functional properties  of neurons and their wiring properties  and the relations between these properties."
"In addition, we analyzed local and global characteristics of the subnetwork consisting of excitatory neurons. We also analyzed modulatory effect by changing the firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Not all results presented in this letter have been verified in animals, and those results can be regarded as predictions for the local circuits in layer 2/3 of the rodent V1 area."
"The first set of predictions concerns the connection pattern between PYR/PYR pairs in layer 2/3 of the V1 area. One prediction is the existence of overrepresented network motifs in the network consisting exclusively of PYR neurons, and such motifs consist of neurons with similar RFs . Previous studies revealed overrepresented network motifs in different sensory areas  but did not investigate the properties  of neurons in these motifs."
"Computational models have been proposed to unravel the underlying mechanism for the emergence of networkmotifs . However, these models take noise as input or do not take sensory input at all; therefore, they cannot relate the motifs related to the RFs of neurons in V1 either. Another prediction, which is closely related to the previous one, is that the PYR neuronal network in layer 2/3 of the rodent V1 area is a smallworld network."
"Functional and anatomical studies have identified many small-world networks in the brain, including the network of all neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans , the medial reticular formation of the vertebrate brain , and a subnetwork of layer 5 PYR neurons in rat somatosensory cortex . But whether the layer 2/3 PYR neuronal network in V1 has this property and how this topology is related to the functional properties of neurons have not been studied yet. A widely accepted assumption about the formation of small-world architecture is that this architecture minimizes the wiring cost ."
"However, it is difficult to conceptualize creating a model specifically designed to result in small-worldness. Our findings demonstrate that this is not necessary. We have shown that the small-worldness emerged from a model based on more basic principles."
"If layer 2/3 PYR neurons in actual brain tissue are verified to form a small-world network, our model will establish a close link between the functional efficiency and structural efficiency of the V1 circuit. The second set of predictions concerns the properties of connections between excitatory-inhibitory pairs and inhibitory-inhibitory pairs, which have not been assessed in animals to date. First, both the I-to-E and E-to-I connection probabilities increase with the similarity between the neurons’ RFs , but the connection probability between inhibitory pairs has only weak dependence on the similarity between the neurons’ responses  or RFs ."
"Second, the I-to-E and E-to-I connection strengths increase with the similarity between the neurons’ RFs . This was also predicted in a previous computational study . Third, the I-to-I connection strength increases with the similarity between the neurons’ responses  and RFs ."
"Fourth, the RF of an inhibitory neuron can somehow be predicted by its presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are strongly connected to it . If these predictions are verified, ourmodel would provide amore complete picture of the local circuits in layer 2/3 of V1. The third set of predictions concerns the modulatory effects."
"One prediction is that if both excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in V1 are suppressed such that the inhibitory neurons’ firing is sufficiently sparse, then after a long period of exposure to natural scenes, the RFs of many inhibitory neurons will also be oriented bars . This is also predicted in another study . An extension of the prediction is that certain subtypes of inhibitory neurons with sparser activities tend to have higher OSI than other subtypes of inhibitory neurons."
"Another prediction is closely related to a previous study , which demonstrated that increasing  the firing rates of the PV neurons linearly decreased  the firing rates of the excitatory neurons. Besides reproducing these results, we predicted that if the activities of the excitatory neurons can be modulated, increasing  their firing rates will linearly increase  the firing rates of PV neurons . These predictions suggest that excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex play complementary roles in encoding the visual stimuli."
"Our model is an extension of a previous model LCN  and the learning algorithm is based on the conventional Hebb rule, similar to what is described in a previous study . The aim of our study is not to propose novel models or learning algorithms, but to unify a number of functional and wiring properties of the V1 circuits in a single model, then make testable predictions. We believe that some spiking models  starting from the same set of assumptions as made in the this study could yield similar results as presented in this letter by taking natural images as input and setting all connections plastic and learnable."
"The reasons are as follows. First, by distinguishing excitatory and inhibitory neurons, spiking models can have sparse neural activities. This is mainly due to the balanced excitatory and inhibitory input to each neuron."
"Another factor contributing to the sparse activities of neurons in our model is the threshold firing property of neurons  because the neurons could not fire when the inputs did not exceed the thresholds. This is an inherent property of spiking models of neurons if the firing rate of a neuron is plotted against the input current . Second, the learning algorithms used in previous spiking models  all follow the same spirit of the Hebb rule  including Oja’s rule, correlation measuring rule and spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule."
"By using a firingrate model instead of a spiking model we aim to shed some light on the development of new artificial neural networks  considering that the mainstream ANNs are firing-rate models. The widely used multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks in the artificial intelligence  field originate from neuroscience, but they have little in common with the visual system of animals in terms of wiring patterns revealed in recent decades. A promising future direction is therefore to extend our proposed model to a new ANN by using deep learning techniques  and test its performance in AI tasks."
"Stimuli. We downloaded 10 512 × 512 pixel grayscale images, used in a previous computational study , that describe natural scenes . 1 The images were whitened such that the amplitudes of low-frequency and high-frequency components in the frequency domain were approximately the same ."
"The data set was augmented by rotating images 90 degrees. The stimuli consisted of 12,000 patches of 20 × 20 pixels extracted from the 20 images at random positions. The L2 norm of every patch was normalized to 800."
Model. We used the Matlab function ode45 to solve equations 2. 1 and 2.
"2), which is based on an explicit Runge–Kutta  formula . The external input c to every neuron for every presentation of stimuli was 2 Hz. Time constants were τE = 100 ms and τI = 50 ms."
"Different values did not affect learning results so long as the simulation time was long enough to allow the solution to converge to steady state. In our experiments, the simulation time was 1000 ms . In accordance with physiological studies , in our model network, the connection probability between a set of neurons was defined as the number of existing connections divided by the number of potential connections between the neurons."
"Since a pair of neurons can have reciprocal connections, the number of potential connections between N neurons is N. If a neuron pair has reciprocal connections, they are said to be bidirectionally connected. If a neuron pair has one and only one connection, they are said to be unidirectionally connected."
The bidirectional  connection probability between a set of neurons was defined as the number of existing bidirectionally  connected neuron pairs divided by the maximum number of potential bidirectionally  connected pairs. The maximum numbers of potential bidirectionally and unidirectionally connected pairs between N neurons are both N/2. Local Connection Patterns in the Excitatory Neuronal Network.
"We generated 100 random networks whose bidirectional and unidirectional connection probabilities matched those of the learned excitatory neuronal network. From each network, we randomly selected 10,000 K-cell subnets and counted the number of connections in every K-cell subnet. Because the connections are directed, the possible number of connections in a K-cell subnet ranges between zero and K."
"The numbers obtained in the learned network are called the observed values, and the numbers obtained in the random networks are called the expected values . Two neurons were said to be neighbors if a connection existed between them, regardless of its direction. We randomly selected an N-cell subnet from a network and recorded the number of common neighbors of two randomneurons in the subnet."
"This processwas repeated 10,000 times, yielding 10,000 numbers, for every network . The distribution of the numbers is plotted in Figure 8, left. The connection probability of two neurons as a function of the number of common neighbors is plotted in Figure 8, right."
Characterization of the Small-Worldness. Two quantities are usually used to characterize a small-world network: the average shortest path length over all pairs of nodes and the average clustering coefficient over all nodes . The shortest path length between two nodes is the minimum number of connections traveling from one node to the other.
"The clustering coefficient of a node is defined as the number of connections that actually exist between all its neighbors, divided by the maximum number of connections that can exist between all its neighbors. We only calculated the two quantities in the undirected and unweighted networks formed by excitatory neurons. Visualization of the Connection Pattern among Excitatory Neurons."
The connections among K excitatory neurons  were visualized using the free software Circos . A K × K connection matrix was created in which the element at location  was the connection weight from the ith neuron to the jth neuron. The neurons were sorted according to their preferred orientations in both columns and rows.
"In the case of undirected and unweighted networks, the nonzero elements in the matrix were set to 1; only the upper diagonal matrix was shown because Circos treats every network as a directed graph, and there is no need to show the connections in the lower diagonal matrix, which are symmetric to the connections in the upper diagonal matrix. The second part of the twentieth century was charac terized by the development of new preparations trying  to con fi rm the Hebb principle . In 1970,  E."
"Kandel elaborated the gill-withdrawal re fl ex   paradigm from his work with  Aplysia : a water current  on the gills produced their retraction. He elaborated  the circuit involved, from the tactile receptors in the  skin to the monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways  that induced the contraction of the gills. Over a period  of 30 years, Kandel and coworkers explained the cel lular and molecular mechanisms of habituation and  dishabituation."
They demonstrated differential classi cal conditioning of the GWR of  Aplysia  and proposed  activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and pre synaptic interaction between high intracellular Ca 2+  levels and 5-HT. Many reviews have been published  on the preparation differentiating short- and long-term  memory storage . Postsynaptic pro cesses are also involved in memory mechanisms in  invertebrates.
"Neurotransmitters, second messenger  systems, protein kinases, ion channels, and transcrip tion factors like CREB have been con fi rmed to func tion in both vertebrate and invertebrate learning and  memory storage. The second preparation was on the mammalian  hippocampus, a very stereotyped structure composed  of an S curve, the dentate gyrus, the subiculum, and  the enthorinal cortex and the three parts, CA3, CA2,  and CA1. This structure was known from EEG record ings for its characteristic 4–12 Hz oscillation, the  theta rhythm associated with movement through  space."
"The phenomenon of long-term potentiation   was initially observed in 1966 in the hippocam pus of the rabbit by Terje Lomo, then working in the  laboratory of Andersen. In 1973, he described the  phenomenon in a seminal paper  [  41  ] . High frequency  stimulation increased the excitatory response in the  postsynaptic cell for 30 min to 10 h ."
"LTP  was con fi rmed in hippocampus slices in 1975 by  Schwartzkroin and Wester. At the beginning of the  1980s, the role of NMDA receptors and calcium in fl ux  at the postsynaptic cell became evident. Over the last  years, evidence has accumulated to support the notion  that dendritic spines are not passive structures but are  involved in memory storage."
"Also, the hippocampus appeared to possess “ place cells ” that  fi re when the  animal is in a speci fi c place of a given environment. Following this discovery, O’Keefe and Nadel in 1978   [  42  ]  proposed that the primary function of the rat hip pocampus is to form a “ cognitive map” of the envi ronment . Invertebrates also perform complex neuronal activi ties."
"Learning in honeybees can be compared to learn ing in vertebrates in many respects, and the honeybee  can be used as a model system to gain an understand ing of the intermediate levels of complexity of cogni tive functions and their neural substrates. The  “ minibrain ” of the honeybee, with its 960,000 neurons,  is now extensively explored; as Menzel said in a recent  article “ Small brain ,  bright mind !”. Analysis of the brain’s cortical activities linked  with a learning behavior was studied systematically  in monkeys where different cortical units of different  areas, sensory or motor, have been recorded in rela tion with a given behavior ."
"In the late  1980s, it became possible to record several units  simultaneously; with this one could analyze the tem poral structure of activity patterns. It appeared that  ongoing activity has predictive power and that self generated  fl uctuations can sometimes synchronize in  attention or during high-level activities  [  43  ] . The  mirror neurons  discovered by the group of Rizzolatti  in 1996 have spectacular properties."
"These cells are  both activated when the subject performs a motor  action or when the subject observes someone in front  performing the same action. Described  fi rst in the  monkey, mirror neurons were con fi rmed in human. They have been considered as the substrate of several  behaviors linked with action, intention, emotion, and  empathy."
"Their dysfunction leads to impairment in  social interactions as seen, for instance, in autism dis orders; see  [  44  ] . Two types of recordings were used:  fi rst the EEG and  then cortical imaging. EEG was a very global activity;  still several events seemed linked with cognition."
"In  1964, Walter et al. described the  contingent negative  variation   as a response linked to attention and  vigilance. Sutton et al."
"in 1965  [  45  ]  described the  “ P300  ” wave, an event-related potential . Both were different, the CNV re fl ecting early arousal  and attentional processes, P300 related to a decisional  behavior involved in stimulus evaluation or categoriza tion. Analyzed with other waves this showed that the  brain produced some electrical signals linked with  cognitive activities."
B. Libet  in the 1980s suggested that a  readiness potential is formed in the cortex 500 ms  before a voluntary movement  [  46  ] . Thus decisions  made by a subject are  fi rst being made at a subconscious  level and become conscious only afterwards.
"With new  brain scanning technology, Soon et al. were  even able to demonstrate that the delay could reach 10 s  before a subject is conscious of his decision. N."
"Geschwind  worked on aphasia and  epilepsy, as well as dyslexias and on the neuroanatomy  of cerebral lateral asymmetries. He coined the term  behavioral neurology  in the 1970s to describe the  ensemble of elements composing higher cortical func tions. Ungerleider and Mishkin  proposed sepa rate pathways for characterizing object shape and  location in extrastriate visual cortex."
"Around the 1990s,  brain imaging became extensively used to con fi rm the  data previously collected in neuropsychology with  clinical observations and post-mortem analysis  . The different primary areas, sensory and  motor, were characterized much more precisely. When  more complex tasks were analyzed, associative areas  were added."
"Computational neuroscience is the theoretical analysis  and modeling of biological neural systems . Its goal is to propose models of biological neural net works in order to relate them to cognitive processes and  behavior. They range from simple behavior with indi vidual neurons, through models with learning and mem ory and short-term/long-term plasticity."
"Some of the  models use architectures of Bayesian neural networks to  include predictive capabilities and to use probabilities in  order to characterize and process information. Animal models had been employed from the early  days of science. Perhaps the  fi rst was the frog by the  Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam  who  analyzed the nerve-muscle preparation and demon strated that the nervous conduction was not due to the  “ animal ’ s spirits ” as it was said by Galen  and René Descartes , an old notion  that considered the presence of a  fl uid necessary for  muscle contractions."
"Swammerdam proved that when  a muscle contracted, its volume did not change . Frogs were used routinely thereafter. Their  great advantage was that the preparation stays alive for  several hours at room temperature, as the animals are  poikilotherms."
"During the nineteenth century, invertebrates were con sidered for some of their very particularly large neural  structures, such as the giant  fi ber system of the earth worm, of the leech, or of the crab. The animal receiving  most attention at the time was the cray fi sh that the  British biologist T. H."
"Huxley  described in  great detail in his book “The cray fi sh” . In the  preface he explained the goal of such models defending  comparative anatomy with great emphasis: “I have  desired, in fact, to show how the careful study of one of  the commonest and most insigni fi cant of animals, leads  us, step by step, from every-day knowledge to the wid est generalizations and the most dif fi cult problems of  zoology; and, indeed, of biological  science in general. ”  During the twentieth century, invertebrates were  used to  fi nd particular neuronal structures that could  be analyzed easily in a particular animal."
"The best  example is the famous squid axon that gave Hodgkin,  Huxley, and Katz the possibility to understand nervous  conduction . The discovery of the giant  axon has been described by J. S."
"Young. He had  identi fi ed the long  fi ber at the Naples’ marine research  station and had initially thought that it was a blood  vessel. In 1935, Young came to Woods Hole where  squids were kept in very good shape in circular aquari ums."
"He observed that an electrical stimulation of that  giant  fi ber did not induce a muscle twitch. Young sug gested that the best stimulus could be a chemical stim ulus like Na +  citrate. Then, he connected a  fi ber to an  ampli fi er and a speaker and put some citrate on the  end of it."
"“Out came – buzzzzzzzz – one of the best  sounds I have ever heard” said Young several years  later. It was the beginning of intense work on this  nerve  fi ber on both sides of the Atlantic with Cole and  Curtiss in Woods Hole, and the British in Plymouth  and Cambridge. Cray fi sh and the larger crustaceans  Homarus  or  Pali nurus  have been excellent models for  characterizing  neuromuscular innervation."
"The Dutch Cornelius  Adrianus Gerrit Wiersma  at the University  of California  analyzed systematically the  peripheral nerve-muscle system of crustaceans. Recording after stimulation of the different leg motor  nerves, excitatory junction potentials with an Einthoven  string galvanometer, he demonstrated the existence of  separate excitatory and inhibitory motoneurons . The opener distal muscle was exceptional with only  two motoneurons, one excitatory and one inhibitory."
"Insects, in particular crickets and cockroaches, pre sented the same advantages and were often used. In  re fl ex activities it has been possible to characterize the  proprioceptive control of each motoneuron of a given  muscle . They were known to have large nervous cells."
"This was  demonstrated by Angélique Arvanitaki  in  Lyon, France, when working on the sea slug  Aplysia . At the marine station of Tamaris  she dis covered its very complex nervous system. She pre sented a general description of the different ganglia  focusing on the visceral ganglion with the largest cells  ."
Several electrical record ings were made. She observed spontaneous rhythmic  activity in some cells . Her best intracellular recordings were carried out  in 1955.
L. Tauc at the Marey Institute in Paris  analyzed  the different intracellular potentials with two micro electrodes. Arvanitaki travelled to the U.
"S. in 1958 and  reported there on her preparation in several leading  laboratories. As a result, the procedure was adopted by  the scienti fi c community, in particular by Eric Kandel."
Aplysia  – as most invertebrate preparations – was  studied because neural networks consist of only a  small number of neurons. This has several advantages. It is possible to locate cell bodies inside ganglia and  to produce an initial form of “neurogeography”  showing a small number of interneurons  able to control selected hierarchical behaviors.
"Cells  were identi fi ed as contributing to restricted circuits  supporting a stereotyped behavior through re fl ex  modulation. It was “the golden age” for these  preparations!  Miller and Selverston, studying the stomatogastric  ganglion of Crustacea – perhaps the key preparation  for neural networks  –  fi lled identi fi ed  neurons with procyon yellow and killed them with  blue light . This allowed to study the net work with and without a single neuron."
"It appeared  around 1960, that a great number of isolated inverte brate ganglia presented a central rhythmical activity  that was called a  central pattern generator  ,  a term  fi rst used in 1965 by Wilson and Wyman. The pharmacological differences between inver tebrates and vertebrates have also been used. Expression of the insect allatostatin receptor in a  population of mouse neurons allows to activate them  selectively by applying allatostatin, since there is no  mammalian receptor that responds to this peptide  ."
"The onset and reversal inactivation can be  accomplished rapidly. For example, in the mouse  spinal cord it was possible to characterize the role of  V1 interneurons. The new  fi eld of “optogenetics”  now develops several probes that when activated by  light open channels or initiate second messenger  cascades, increasing the toolbox for manipulative  experiments."
"In the eighteenth century, it was not possible to keep  mammals alive for more than 10 min after surgical  opening. Once they could be kept alive for several  hours they were considered for neurobiological stud ies. Cats were employed by Sherrington for spinal cord  experiments – his most famous experiment induced  decerebrate rigidity after severance at the level of the  brain stem: the cat was in complete extension due to  the suppression of inhibition coming from the cortex."
"F. Bremer  proposed in 1935 the “isolated  encephalon ” and the “isolated brain  stem ” that were considered as key  elements in the understanding of sleep. In the former case, the cat was awake and sleepy as normal, in the  latter it slept all the time ."
"The dif fi culty was to stimulate central nuclei or  particular pathways. This was only possible with the  apparatus proposed by Horsley-Clarke in the early  twentieth century. Around 1890, the famous neurosur geon Victor Horsley , who was professor  in London at Brown Institute, met Robert-Henry  Clarke  from Queens College of  Cambridge and they became close friends."
"Around  1895, Clarke proposed to build an apparatus that  fi xed  the head of the cat at the mouth, ears, and at the base of  the orbits. The brain was mapped in a 3D system ,  dorso ventral , and rostrocaudal ). In 1906, James  Swift built the prototype in London."
"It was published  in  Brain  in 1908 and it was quite useful for limited  electrolytic lesions. The original apparatus is now in  the Museum of the University College Hospital,  London. But the two friends had very different charac ters, Clarke was a great sportsman, enjoying life but  was very shy."
Horsley was “very Victorian” and extro vert. Clarke did not accept the glory around his col league and became paranoiac. The apparatus went to  California and seemed abandoned.
It was only used  again 30 years later around 1940 with the electrical  stimulations of the reticular formation. It was then  used extensively in all physiological laboratories for  more than 40 years. The “cat model”-period came to an end in the 1980s;  cats were progressively abandoned for ethical reasons  but also for their high cost and for the duration of the  preparation.
"The rat appeared as a suitable alternative,  it was much easier to explore, the anatomy and  the pharmacology were well described. The success of  the invertebrates had introduced some “simple  vertebrates” like the lamprey,  Xenopus  eggs, or the  tortoise. Lower vertebrate preparations were a good  solution with even their simplicity, a similar anatomy  and functional  properties as they exist in all verte brates."
"For example, S. Grillner analyzed in great detail  the anguilliform mode of locomotion of the lamprey,  and A. Roberts and K."
"Sillar the swimming of the  developing  Xenopus  tadpole. Two other very popular preparations that can be  used today for  in vitro  or  in vivo  chronological record ings are the chick and the neonatal rat. The great inter est is that both have an embryonic stage of 3 weeks and  a postnatal life of similar duration, 3 weeks."
"Their  development is quite different though: the precocial  chick is able to walk at birth, while the altricial neo natal rat needs to remain in the nest, its development  is gradual. A comparison of the two species is  very  useful for understanding maturation processses. Pioneering work on chicks was performed by Ham burger and Balaban  and on rats by Otsuka  and Konishi ."
"Recently, mice have become  the most important laboratory animals because  •  techniques have been developed to generate transgenic  strains. Two other methods have been used in  neuroscience:  Brain slices: This technique was developed in the  •  late 1960s to study the hippocampus. Thick sec tions of living brain tissue are maintained  in vitro  in  a solution of arti fi cial cerebrospinal  fl uid that dif fuses into all pieces of tissue."
"Used extensively and  for almost all regions of mammalian central ner vous system, slices preserve many circuits that can  be  fi nely analyzed. Cell cultures: Slices of CNS tissues that are pre pared from young rodents are maintained in cul ture with a stable medium for many weeks. Nerve  cells continue to differentiate and to develop a tis sue organization that closely resembles that  observed in situ."
"Long-term survival is achieved  by culturing slices at the air/liquid interface, either  by continuously rotating the preparation  or by culturing  them on semiporous membranes . Several models are used depending on the behavioral  sequences that can be recorded and the facility to  obtain and reproduce them. Let us consider birds and  their singing behaviors, for instance."
"They vary among  species, and most singing takes place during the breed ing season. These songs are learned and not inherited. The avian vocal organ is called the syrinx; it is a bony  structure at the bottom of the trachea."
"The most com mon species studied are the zebra  fi nch , the chaf fi nch , the  European starling, and the robin. Studies on singing  nervous centers con fi rmed the complexity of its pro duction and some correspondences with human  speaking. In mammals, most of the behavioral analysis is  done on rats or mice."
"Monkeys are also used: the squir rel monkey  is interesting for vision,  vocalization, and olfactory communication, the baboon   for manual coordination. In  Papio papio  light-induced epilepsy was discovered by R. Naquet."
With photonic stimulation at 20–25 Hz spontaneous  bifrontal discharges  occur. This epilepsy has been found also in humans. The most useful monkeys for electrophysiology  have been  Macacus  and  Rhesus mulatta  that survive  well in captivity.
"In 1965, E. V. Evarts   was able to record single cortical neurons from the  motor area of monkeys controlling the  fl exion or the  extension of their wrist."
"He found that some units are  activated about 100 ms before the movements. This  was a start of several studies on these animals to ana lyze cortical organization. With this new discipline, new models were created  with two opposite considerations."
"One was to  fi nd the  simplest system for particular questions, the second  was to be near to humans to examine different  pathologies. Sydney Brenner as a molecular biologist created the  f  i rst computer matrix analysis of nucleic acids. He  was then interested to  fi nd the most simple animal to  analyze biological activities."
"He explained his goal in  a letter to Max Perutz: : “The experi mental approach I would like to follow is to attempt to  de fi ne the unitary steps of development using the  techniques of genetic analysis… Our success with  bacteria has suggested to me that we could use the  same approach to study the speci fi cation and control  of more complex processes in cells of higher organ isms. As a  fi rst stage, I would like to initiate studies  into the control of cell division in higher cells, in par ticular to try to  fi nd out what determines meiosis and  mitosis. In this work there is a great need to “microbi ologize” the material so that one can handle the cells  as one handles bacteria and viruses."
"Hence, like in the  case of replication and transcription, one wants a  model system. ” He then decided to work on a small  nematode worm,  Caenorhabditis briggsae  . Brenner has  demonstrated very clearly that a scienti fi c project is  exclusively linked with the model used."
"At his Nobel  lecture on December 2002, he proposed the following  title to congratulate his modest nematode: “ Nature ’ s  Gift to Science ”. Investigations with  Drosophila melanogaster  started  even earlier – Thomas Hunt Morgan   had employed it in his genetic studies. He was a  highly competent zoologist who had  fi rst worked at  Naples marine station in 1894."
"By 1904, when Morgan  took a professorship in experimental zoology at  Columbia University, he was becoming increasingly  focused on the mechanisms of heredity and evolu tion. In 1900 Hugo De Vries , a Dutch  botanist,  proposed that new species are created by  mutation. Following the American entomologist C."
W. Woodworth  and the American geneti cist W. E.
"Castle , Morgan in 1908 started  working on the fruit  fly. In 1909, a  series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which  displaying Mendelian inheritance patterns. In 1910,  Morgan found a white-eyed mutant male among  the red-eyed wild types."
"In 1915, he published with  his team the seminal book  The Mechanism of  Mendelian Heredity  and he was later awarded the  Nobel Prize  for his genetic studies of this  small  fly. The zebrafish  Danio rerio , a tropical freshwater  fish, is an ideal model organism for studies of verte brate development and gene function for various rea sons: the genetic code is fully sequenced, the  fi sh is  easily observable and testable for developmental  behavior, the mutants are well-characterized, the  embryonic development is rapid, it takes only 3 days  from egg to larva. Embryos that develop outside the  mother are large and transparent."
"Drugs may be admin istered directly to the tank. Today, the most intensively used animals for genetic  studies are mice. Work on this model is so dominant  that we have sometimes the impression to only charac terize the neuroscience of mice! The modern theory of biological evolution, as estab lished by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace  in the middle of the nineteenth century, is based on  three interrelated facts:   phylogeny  – the common  history of organisms on earth stretching back over 3."
"5  billion years,   evolution  in a narrow sense –  modi fi cations of organisms during phylogeny and  underlying mechanisms, and   speciation  – the  process by which new species arise during phylogeny. Regarding the phylogeny, it is now commonly accepted  that all organisms on Earth are derived from a com mon ancestor or an ancestral gene pool, while contro versies have remained since the time of Darwin and  Wallace about the major mechanisms underlying the  observed modi fi cations during phylogeny . The prevalent view of  neodarwinism   is charac terized by the assumption that evolutionary changes  are caused by a combination of two major processes,   heritable variation of individual genomes within a  population by mutation and recombination, and   natural selection, i."
"e. , selective environmental or  genomic forces leading to better adaptation of those  bearing the mutation and as a consequence to their  greater differential reproductive success. The  modern  synthesis  holds that evolutionary changes are gradual  in the sense that larger, macro-evolutionary, changes  are the sum of smaller, micro-evolutionary, changes."
"Other experts argue that such a gradualistic view of  evolution  is incomplete; they point to a number of other  and perhaps equally important mechanisms such as   neutral gene evolution without natural selection,   mass extinctions wiping out up to 90 % of existing  species  and  genetic  and epigenetic-developmental  self-canal ization of evolutionary processes  [  2  ] . It remains uncer tain as to which of these possible processes principally  drive the evolution of nervous systems and brains. In most cases, the reconstruction of the evolution of  nervous systems and brains cannot be based on fossil ized material, since their soft tissues decompose, but  has to make use of the distribution of neural traits in  extant species."
"This is usually done by means of the  phylogenetic or cladistic method as originally devel oped by the German entomologist Willi Hennig  [  3  ] . This method is based on whether a given character  represents an ancestral,  plesiomorphic , or a  derived,  apomorphic  state. The result of such an analy sis is a “tree” called  cladogram  re fl ecting shared  derived characters called  synapomorphies  or  homolo gies ."
"Characters used for the construction of a  clado gram  can be of any nature, but mostly are anatomical  or biochemical. The standard criterion between com peting cladograms is the  principle of parsimony  stat ing that the most likely evolutionary hypothesis is that  minimizing the number of independent  steps of modi fi cation of the character  under consideration. If different species of animals  coincide in the formation of a given character in detail  , then it appears  more likely that these species are related and the coin cidence of characters is due to common ancestry, i."
"e. ,  that they are  homologous . However, there is increasing  evidence that convergent-homoplastic evolution is  much more common than previously believed, which  weakens the principle of parsimony."
"In the reconstruction of the evolution of nervous  systems and brains, however, the primary goal is  not the construction of new cladograms, but an answer  to the question whether within a group  of ani mals the presence or absence of a given character, e. g. ,  the six-layered isocortex as found in all mammals, rep resents an ancestral  or derived  state."
"This requires the availability of  well-established cladograms, which are based on non neural characters in order to avoid circular conclu sions. However, such well-established cladograms do  not always exist, and therefore one often has to operate  with competitive cladograms. Figure  2."
"1  illustrates the present knowledge about  the major groups of organisms – the “tree of life”. According to most recent evidence, the earth was  formed about 4. 5 billion years ago ."
First organ isms appeared about 3. 5 bya as prokaryotic bacteria  and archaea . Unicellular eukaryotes  originated 2.
"7–1. 6 bya, simple multicellular  animals  about 1 bya, and coelenterates about  700 million years ago . First deuterostomes and  first arthropods appeared 570 mya, cephalopods as  well as  fi rst  fi shlike animals and proto-amphibians  about 500 mya, insects about 400 mya, amphibians  360 mya, reptiles 300 mya, mammals 200 mya, and  birds 150 mya."
"First human-like animals  appeared 4 mya, and modern humans  200,000–150,000 years ago. Nervous systems and brains have a dual function, i. e."
",  the maintenance of inner “vital” functions of the organ ism and the control of behavior of that organism within  a given environment  [  4  ] . Unicellular organisms exert  the same functions and exhibit remarkably complex  behaviors, although they do not possess, by de fi nition,  a nervous system. Bacteria  sense nutritive substances  or  toxins  in their environments through  a large number of chemoreceptors as well as obstacles  through mechanoreceptors  [  5  ] ."
"This diverse informa tion is integrated and, through a chain of complex  chemical reactions, drives their  fl agella for movement. Escherichia coli  has six  fl agella, each possessing a pro ton-driven motor, that are combined to one single  super fl agellum for forward propulsion  as soon  as receptors detect an increase in nutritive or a decrease  in toxic substances. In the opposite case, the  super fl agellum disintegrates, and the single  fl agella  move independently."
"As a consequence,  E . coli  starts  “tumbling” and randomly changes its direction of  movement until the receptors sense a new gradient, and  a new “run” begins. The bacterium has a mini-memory,  by which it can compare the incoming information with  previous information, and this “knowledge” determines  the behavior."
"Thus, even in these most primitive organ isms we  fi nd the three basic components for adaptive  control of behavior, i. e. , a sensorium, a motorium and in  between information storage and processing."
"Other  bacteria or archaea like  Halobacterium  possess light sensitive spots that make them swim toward sunlight. Unicellular eukaryotes such as  Paramecium  or  Euglena , despite their unicellular organization, exhibit  a much more complex control of behavior than bacte ria or archaea  [  6  ] . They possess either  fl agella com posed of microtubules and attached to their front,  which bend to perform a breakstroke, or cilia that  cover the entire body and are able to exert coordinated  movements, or pseudopodia."
"They gather information  about their environment through voltage-gated, hyper polarizing potassium and depolarizing calcium ion  channels, while voltage-gated sodium channels are  absent and found only from planarians, possibly cni darians onwards. The calcium and potassium channels  are used, among others, for the release of forward and  backward movement. Many protozoans respond to  chemical, tactile, temperature and visual stimuli."
Euglena  and  Paramecium  and other unicellular  eukaryotes possess light-sensitive organelles for pho totaxis. It is debated whether they already possess an  intracellular system for central movement  coordination. Figure  2.
"2  illustrates the phylogeny of the Metazoa,  i. e. , multicellular organisms, which are divided into  Nonbilateria and Bilateria."
"Porifera  are the simplest metazoans. They  possess “independent effectors” or  myocytes , which  have sensori-motor functions and directly respond to  stimuli, but are not electrically excitable  [  7  ] . Sponges  can regulate the water stream through openings   inside their body by modifying the diameters of these  ostia."
"The inner surface of the ostia is covered with  choanocytes carrying one  fl agellum each, and their  movement can drive the water through the ostium in a  coordinated fashion. The presence of true nerve cells is  debated, because there is no convincing evidence for  electrical signal conduction. Eumetazoans comprise all metazoans except the  Porifera."
"The evolutionary origin of the  fi rst nerve  cells among eumetazoans is still a matter of debate  . One assumption is that sensory and nerve  cells originated from neuromuscular cells, while  other authors postulate an independent origin of sen sory, nerve, and muscle cells from epithelial cells. The “paraneuron” concept proposes the evolution of  nerve cells from secretory cells."
"Even unicellular  eukaryotes, plants, and non-neuronal cells display  many features of nerve cells such as membrane poten tial, transmitters and other neuroactive substances,  membrane receptors, ion channels, many chemical  processes relevant for “neuronal information process ing”, and even action potentials – all of which being  more than 1 billion years old and thus older than  nerve cells and nervous systems. One remarkable  exception is the voltage-gated sodium channel, which is found  fi rst in planarians, perhaps already in  cnidarians. Coelenterates are nonbilaterian eumetazoans."
"Today  they are considered two independent phyla, Cnidaria  and Ctenophora  and  exhibit both the simplest types of nervous system   as well as relatively complex forms, i. e. ,  radially symmetric nervous systems ."
"A cen tral nervous system is absent  [  7  ] . The phylum Cnidaria  comprises the sessile Anthozoa , Scyphozoa , Cubozoa , and  Hydrozoa . Epidermal nerve nets are found in  sessile hydrozoans like the freshwater polyp  Hydra ."
"There is a concentration  around the  mouth and the peduncle of this animal. Complex sense  organs are absent, but  Hydra  responds to mechanical,  chemical, visual, and temperature stimuli. The  free-swimming medusa forms of scyphozoans, in con trast, possess complex circular nervous systems inside  the rim of the umbrella – the inner  subumbrellar  nerve  ring contains large bipolar “swim motor neurons” for  synchronous umbrella contraction, and the outer  exumbrellar  nerve ring consists of small multipolar  sensory cells which are in contact with light-sensitive  cells in mouth and tentacles."
"Both nerve rings are  interconnected. Sensory organs are the ocelli ,  statocystes , and “rhopalia”, i. e."
", com plex clublike balance organs, often combined with  photo- and chemoreceptors, which initiate the rhyth mic contraction of the medusas. The nervous system of  cnidarians is characterized by the dominance of elec tric synapses, although chemical synapses are likewise  present. Chemical transmission is mostly exerted by a  number of neuropeptides , although there is evidence of  cholingergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and gluta matergic transmissions in different cnidarians species."
"Animals with bilateral symmetry  com prise the three major groups of phyla, the Acoelomorpha,  Protostomia, and Deuterostomia, the latter two together  forming the “Coelomata”, i. e. , organisms with a sec ondary body cavity ."
"However, the phy logeny of the Bilateria has not yet been  fi rmly  consolidated. Acoelomorpha include very small bilateral animals  resembling  fl atworms and were previously assigned to  the phylum Platyhelminthes . They possess  a diffuse subepidermal nerve net resembling that of  Hydra  and representing the simplest form of a bilateral  nervous system."
"Since such diffuse subepidermal nerve  nets are likewise found in other  fl atworm-like  organisms, it is not certain whether this type has  evolved independently, e. g. , via secondary simpli fi cation  of more complex types  [  11  ]  or represents the ancestral  form of all bilaterial nervous systems  [  12  ] ."
"According to molecular phylogeny , pro tostome phyla are grouped into the Lophotrochozoa –  animals carrying a lophophor  or possessing a trochophora larva, and the  Ecdysozoa, i. e. , with ecdysis ."
"Many phyla  of the lophotrochozoans include small and often ses sile organisms such as the Bryozoa , the Brachiopoda, Echiura, Entoprocta, or  Nemertini – all with simple to very simple  nervous systems consisting of two or more  nerve cords extending from a supraesophageal gan glion through the elongated body, which are connected  by a number of commissures. In the following, only  the larger phyla are described. Platyhelminthes ,  comprise a number of species previously called  “Turbellaria” , and the endoparasitic  tapeworm groups Cestoda   and Trematoda ."
"The  phylogeny of platyhelminths remains unresolved, how ever. “Turbellarian” platyhelminths may possess very simple nervous systems resembling the subepidermal  diffuse nerve net found in the Acoela. In other forms,  there is a supraesophageal ganglion giving rise to dor sal and ventral longitudinal cords connected by com missural tracts."
"The longitudinal cords can either  consist entirely of  fi bers or of  fi bers forming regularly  arranged ganglia . The most complex nervous  systems are found in predatory  fl atworms   such as  Notoplana  and  Stylochoplana  with cerebral  ganglia consisting of  fi ve different “brain masses”. Flatworms possess a variety of sense organs such as  tactile or chemoreceptors on the head and all over the  body, statocysts and inverse or everse pigment pit eyes  containing several hundred photoreceptors ."
"Some of them are found as a pair of ocelli on the head,  other terrestrial  fl atworms have more than 1,000 ocelli. Due to their endoparasitic life style, trematodes and  cestodes have a simpli fi ed nervous system consisting  of a simple “brain” and a varying number of longitudi nal  fi ber tracts. Annelida   are another large lophotrochozoan group."
"They are  divided into Polychaeta  and Clitellata, the latter comprising oli gochaetes  and hirudineans ,  both without hairs and parapodia. Annelids possess a  paired “ladder-type” central nervous system . In its simplest state this structure consists of a cerebral  or supraesophageal nerve ring or ganglion giving rise  to paired ventral cords with a pair of ganglia per body  segment connected by transverse connectives ."
"In annelids, the cerebral ganglion has vari ously undergone an increase in complexity; in predatory  polychaetes it has developed into a three-partite brain  resembling the proto-, deuto-, and tritocerebrum of the  insect brain . Here, but also in some oligochaetes, the  fi rst segments of the ventral nerve cord  are often fused into a subesophageal ganglion. In the  oligochaetes, we  fi nd a modest, and in hirudineans a  massive simpli fi cation of this basic organization."
"Within the ventral nerve cord of most oligochaetes and  some polychaetes there are giant  fi bers with very fast  conduction velocity  separated  from the thinner  fi bers. Annelids possess a large vari ety of tactile and chemosensory organs, feelers or  antennae, palps, and one ciliated “nuchal organ” pos sibly involved in light detection. Other light-sensitive  organs range from very simple pigment spots and eye  pits to compound eyes and lens eyes with accommoda tion mechanism in some predatory polychaetes, and  have evolved independently of similar eye types in  other animal groups ."
"Molluska are the largest lophotrochozoan group  . Their phylogenetic rela tionships are still unresolved. Besides several smaller  groups, there are three large taxa, i."
"e. , Gastropoda  , Bivalvia  , and Cephalopoda . The molluskan nervous systems range from rela tively simple  forms resembling those  found in acoelans to the most complex ones among  invertebrates, in the cephalopods."
"The basic pattern is  a  tetraneural  nervous system consisting of a cerebral  ganglion, which gives rise to two dorsal pleurovisceral  and two ventral pedal nerve cords. In the ancestral  state, nerve cell bodies are not concentrated in ganglia,  but are dispersed throughout the cords. The formation of ganglia in mollusks is a derived state that occurred  independently of the formation of ganglia in other  forms such as annelids and arthropods."
"The nervous system of snails and slugs consists of four  nerve cords – hence the term  tetraneural  nervous sys tem – with maximally six pairs of ganglia and mostly  one unpaired visceral ganglion . The nerve  cords are mostly linked by commissures. The paired  cerebral ganglia connected by a commissure are  located around the esophagus and process information to and from the eyes, to statocysts, head tentacles,  skin, and muscles of the lip, head, and sometimes  penis region."
"One pair of buccal ganglia with a com missure is situated below the esophagus and innervates  the pharynx, salivary glands, a nerve plexus of the  esophagus and the stomach. One pair of pleural  ganglia without a commissure is con nected by cords with the cerebral, buccal, and parietal visceral ganglia. The pedal ganglia innervate feet  muscles and skin."
"The cerebral, pleural, and pedal  ganglia together form the “brain”. The supra- and sub intestinal ganglia innervate the gills, the “osphradium”   and parts of the mantle and skin;  one pair of parietal ganglion  innervates the lateral walls of the body. Finally,  the unpaired visceral ganglion supplies the caudal  region of the gut, anus, and neighboring regions of the  skin and body wall, sexual organs, kidney, liver, and  heart."
"It completes the “visceral loop”, i. e. , the chain  of ganglia and cords from the pleural to the visceral  ganglion."
"A fusion of ganglia, mostly of the “visceral loop”,  is observed in many gastropods, e. g. , in air-breathing  landsnails."
"The most highly developed gastropod  “brain” is found in  Helix pomatia  . It consists of a protocerebrum with  globuli  and  dense neuropils, a mesocerebrum, and a postcerebrum  with pleural and pedal lobes. This organization is  remarkably similar to that of other invertebrates  with complex brains, but has presumably evolved  independently."
"Gastropods have chemoreceptive and mechanore ceptive sense organs distributed all over the body. Complex sense organs comprise statocysts, eyes rang ing from widely open pit eyes , pinhole eyes   to lense eyes , and chemosensitive  osphradia in the mantle near the gills. Some sea slugs have gained fame in modern neuro biology, e."
"g. , the Californian “sea hare”  Aplysia cali fornica , which possesses some very large nerve cells  that can be detected with the naked eye and are well suited for studies of neuronal information processing  and learning processes  [  15  ] . Bivalves  have a secondarily simpli fi ed nervous system  with only three pairs of ganglia with an emphasis on  the visceral ganglion, which is often fused with the  parietal ganglia."
"In most species, the rostralmost gan glion is a fused cerebral, pleural, and buccal ganglion. Some bivalves, e. g."
", the scallop  Pecten , have eyes on  the rim of the mantle, often with a complex anatomy  . Cephalopods have highly developed nervous systems  characterized by fusion of ganglia and subsequent  development into lobes forming a complex brain  around the esophagus. There are lobes that correspond  to the cerebral, buccal, labial, pleural, and visceral  ganglia of other mollusks, while innovative structures  are the central optic-visual, olfactory, and peduncular  ganglia as well as peripheral branchial and stellar gan glia ."
"The well-known  Nautilus  possesses a relatively  simple brain without bulging supraesophageal lobes  and with unfused subesophageal lobes, which  probably  represents the ancestral state of cephalopods. Members  of the subclass Coleoidea comprising cuttle fi sh, squids,  and octopods have much more complex brains. The  most complex nervous system and brain of all inverte brates is that of the octopus ."
"Its nervous  system contains about 550 million neurons, 350 of  which are located inside the eight arms, 120–180 mil lion neurons in the giant optic lobes, and 42 million  neurons in the brain. The latter encircles the esophagus  and is composed of 38 lobes. The supraesophageal part  is divided into 16 lobes and contains the mass of neu rons."
"It has a ventral portion involved in the control of  feeding and locomotion, and a dorsal portion exerting cognitive functions, mostly visual and tactile chemosensory. The vertical lobe is considered the most  complex part of the octopus brain. It is composed of  f  i ve lobules and contains about 26 million neurons."
"The vertical lobe is closely connected to the subverti cal lobe containing about 800,000 neurons, and the  interaction of both lobes, processed by a spectacularly  regular network of millions of  fi bers arranged in a rect angular fashion, is regarded as the neural basis of the astonishing learning and memory capacity of  Octopus  [  18  ] . Likewise complex are the giant optic lobes exhib iting a laminar neuropil resembling the cortex of mam mals. They process the visual information arriving  from the large lens eyes."
"These eyes are capable of lens  accommodation and pupil contraction achieved by  muscles, and have a striking similarity to the vertebrate  eye, although they are the product of convergent  evolution. The Ecdysozoa comprise all invertebrate animals that  shed their exoskeleton – a process called “ecdysis”. According to present taxonomy they include eight  phyla, the largest of them being the Nematoda and the  Arthropoda."
"The smaller groups mostly have relatively  simple or simpli fi ed brains and simple sense organs. Nematodes  are  the most numerous multicellular animals on Earth. Probably due to their predominantly parasitic lifestyle,  they have very simple nervous systems  con sisting of a nerve ring around the esophagus and a  number of ganglia connected to this ring."
Four to  twelve ventral cords originate from the ring and are  irregularly connected by half-sided commissures. Local ganglia and nerves are found in the caudal gut  and anal region. Some nerves extend from the esopha geal nerve ring to the sense organs in the “head” region  such as sensory papillae and bristles.
"Other sense  organs are chemoreceptive organs called “amphidia”. The tiny nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans  has  become a model organism in molecular and develop mental neurobiology by the work of the South African  molecular neurobiologist Sydney Brenner and col leagues  [  19, 20  ] , a reason being the fact that it has a  very simple nervous system composed of exactly 302  neurons. The basic genetic features and the connectiv ity of this nervous system was completely mapped by  those authors and subsequent studies explored the neu ral and molecular mechanisms responsible for a vari ety of behaviors shown by  C."
elegans   [  21  ] . Arthropods are by far the largest   and most diverse group of animals. They are divided  into protoarthropods  and euarthropods .
"Their taxonomy is not fully  established. Like annelids, arthropods have a ventral, regularly  segmented, paired “ladder-type” nerve cord. Based on  the new taxonomy of protostomes mentioned above,  this organization either has evolved independently in  the lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans from an unseg mented “ur-bilaterian” nervous system or was ances tral and has been lost in many cases  [  11  ] ."
"In all  arthropods, the  fi rst ganglia have fused into a complex  brain. In mandibulates there are three major brain divi sions, i. e."
", a proto-, deuto-, and tritocerebrum. The pro tocerebrum is associated with the paired optic lobes,  the deutocerebrum with the  fi rst and the tritocerebrum  with the second pair of antennae. Mandibulates display  a subesophageal ganglion having formed by fusion of  the three  fi rst ventral ganglia."
"They supply the mouth  region and mandibles, in crustaceans the  fi rst and sec ond maxillae, in insects the maxillae, mandibles and  labium. Caudal ganglia of the ventral cords exhibit a  strong tendency to fuse and to form specialized abdo minal structures  [  22  ] . Extant Chelicerata  comprise  the Arachnida   and Xiphosura ."
"They all possess  specialized feeding appendages called chelicerae , while lacking antennae. The CNS of the cheli cerates is characterized by the absence of a deutocere brum because of lack of antennae; the tritocerebrum  supplies the chelicerae. In xiphosurans, scorpions, and  araneans  there is an increasing tendency  towards fusion of ganglia during ontogeny."
"In many  species of these groups the entire chain of ventral gan glia forms a compact mass around the mouth, in the  araneans below the brain. The brain  of arachnids  consists of a protocerebrum and tritocerebrum. In the  anterior median part of the protocerebrum, corpora  pedunculata  are found, which –  in contrast to insects – are exclusively visual neuropils  associated with the secondary eyes."
A central body is  found in the posterodorsal part and is probably an inte grative center for visual information from the main eyes. The homology of both the corpora pedunculata and the  central body of arachnids with those of insects remains  uncertain  [  22  ] . The tritocerebrum is the ganglion linked  with the chelicerae and is often fused with the subesophageal mass supplying the legs.
This mass is found below  the brain. It consists of a highly variable number of  fused ventral ganglia  . Arachnids have a large variety of sense organs.
"There are vibration-sensitive slit-like lyriform organs  involved in the detection of vibration and in proprio ception and hair sensilla called “trichobothria” on the  legs and lateral and dorsal parts of the body, which are  involved in the detection of airborne vibration and air  currents. Species differ in number of main and second ary eyes. The main eyes are considered homologous to  the ocelli, and the secondary eyes to the compound  eyes of insects."
"Crustaceans  with the larg est group Malacostraca  have  a typical paired “ladder-type” nerve cord as the ances tral form. The brain  is  linked via two connectives with the ventral nerve  cords. The protocerebrum consists of two lateral optic  lobes and the median protocerebrum containing the  anterior and posterior optic neuropils, the protocere bral bridge, and the central body."
"Neuropils of the optic  lobes are highly variable. In decapod crustaceans , there are additional visual neuropils within the  optic lobes, i. e."
", a terminal medulla and the so-called  hemiellipsoid bodies, which some authors conceive to  be homologous to the insect mushroom bodies . Both include a varying number of complex  neuropils; most of them contain glomeruli. The hemiel lipsoid bodies and some of the other neuropils have  connections with the accessory and olfactory lobes of  the deutocerebrum."
"The deutocerebrum contains the  medial and lateral neuropils receiving vestibular and  mechanosensory input from the  fi rst antennae, the  olfactory and parolfactory lobes , and the lateral glomeruli. The tritoce rebrum receives information from the second antennae  and sends motor nerves to them. There are strong dif ferences in the degree of fusion of ventral cord ganglia."
"A subesophageal ganglion controlling mouth append ages is found in many malacostracans, and the fusion  of ganglia is maximal in crabs. Crustaceans have a large number of sense organs. These comprise proprioceptive mechanoreceptors of  leg joints, the chordotonal organs."
"The surface includ ing distal limbs and antennae is covered with mech ano- and chemoreceptors possessing sensilla or setae. Only malacostracans have vestibular organs. An  unpaired nauplius eye, frontal simple eyes and com pound eyes are found, the latter are located either  directly on the head or on eyes elevated on movable  stalks."
"The compound eyes can consist of a few or sev eral 1,000 ommatidia. Insects are the largest group of arthropods, with an  estimated 6–10 million species, most of which are ter restrial . The nervous sys tem of insects consists of a brain  and ventral nerve cords ."
"The  brain, formed by fusion of the  fi rst three ganglia,  consists of a large protocerebrum, a smaller deutocer ebrum, and a very small tritocerebrum. Fiber tracts  connect the brain with the subesophageal ganglion,  constituted by fusion of the  fi rst three ventral cord gan glia. The protocerebrum consists of two hemispheres,  which are continuous with the lateral optic lobes  receiving input from the compound eyes."
"Terminal  fields of the nerves from the ocelli are found in the  posterior median protocerebrum. The central complex  and the  corpora pedunculata  or “mushroom bodies”  , are located in the median protocerebrum . The MB receive olfactory input from the  antennae via the antennal lobes situated in the deutoce rebrum and the antennocerebral tract ."
"In  hymenopterans  the MB also receive  visual projections from the optic lobes, which termi nate in the calyces of the MB. The optic tubercle is  also found in the median protocerebrum which receives  visual input from the optic lobes. These structures are  connected with the ventral cords via descending tracts."
"The smaller deutocerebrum is connected with the pro tocerebrum by a supraesophageal commissure. Mechanoreceptive  fi bers terminate in its dorsal lobe. Here, the antennal lobe is found as terminal  fi eld of  olfactory afferents from the antennae."
Projection neu rons of the antennal lobe send axons to the MB and to  the protocerebral lobe of the protocerebrum via ACT. The deutocerebrum gives rise to the sensory and motor  antennal nerves. The small tritocerebrum is related to  taste perception and origin of the frontal connectives  and the labral nerves.
"The chain of ventral cord ganglia consists of  subesophageal, thoracic, and abdominal ganglia. The  f  i rst innervates the mandibles, maxillae, and labium  as well as the neck musculature. It is also involved in  the innervations of the salivary glands, the corpora  allata , and the frontal ganglion and is considered a  higher motor center for the initiation and control of  behavior."
"Most insects have three thoracic ganglia: a  pro-, meso-, and metathoracic ganglion supplying  legs and wings, if present, with sensory and motor  nerves. Abdominal ganglia  are reduced and fused during development. The visual system of insects comprises the retina of  the compound eye and three optic neuropils, the lamina,  medulla, and lobula complex, which in  fl ies and  butter fl ies is divided into a lobula and lobula plate."
"In  addition to the compound eyes, insects have dorsal eyes,  so-called ocelli, which are simple lens eyes and thought  to exert steering functions during walking and  fl ight. Antennae bear mechanosensitive, olfactory,  hygroreceptive, and temperature-sensitive receptors. The neuropil of the antennal lobe in the deutocerebrum  contains a species-speci fi c number of glomeruli, in  which sensory afferents and interneurons make con tacts."
"Macroglomeruli are found in some male insects  related to sexual pheromone processing. The MBs in hymenopterans are composed of one  calyx or two calyces  and a  peduncle consisting of two lobes, alpha and beta. The  somata of neurons  together with their axons   form the peduncle; the neuronal somata are located in  the outer rim of the calyx."
"The Kenyon  fi bers split up – one collateral enters the  a , and another the  b  lobe. In  the honeybee, the calyces exhibit three vertically  arranged regions, the lip, collar, and basal ring region. Afferents from the antennal lobe terminate in the lip  region, afferents from the medulla and lobula of the  optic neuropils terminate in the collar region, and the  basal ring region receives collaterals from both affer ents as well as from the subesophageal ganglion."
"The  a  and  b  lobes send  fi bers to the median protocerebrum  between the two MBs, the protocerebral lobe lateral to  the MB, the contralateral MB, the optic tubercle and  back to their own calyces. In hymenopterans, the MB  represents a highly complex multimodal center that  forms the neural basis of processing and integrating  olfactory/visual and mechanosensory information and  enables learning , com plex cognitive functions, and complex behavior such  as navigation  [  26  ] . Their output has sensory, move ment-related, and sensorimotor functions."
"MBs differ  substantially across species. For example,  Drosophila  only has a single cup, and spatially segregated  a ,  b ,  and  l  lobes. The central complex of insects consists of four neu ropils, i."
"e. , the protocerebral bridge, an upper division  , a lower divi sion , and the  paired nodules. It receives strong visual as well as  mechanosensory input, but only weak input from the  MB."
"Their precise function is still unclear, but the cen tral complex has to do with premotor integration, ori entation, and control of complex locomotion and path  integration. The homology of the MB and the central bodies   or central complexes in arthropods is debated. The CB of insects and crustaceans are probably homol ogous, whereas homology with CB of chelicerates is  controversial."
"The same holds for the MB in insects  and crustaceans , on  the one hand, and of chelicerates, on the other, partly  because in the latter, the MB receive only visual input. Some authors place the MB of chelicerates closer to  those of onychophorans  [  27  ] . Accordingly, the MB of onychophorans and chelicerates would have evolved  independently of those of the mandibulates or  underwent substantial functional and structural changes  in their ancestral organization."
"As illustrated in Fig. 2. 12 , the superphylum  Deuterostomia, i."
"e. , animals with a “secondary mouth”,  comprise the phyla Echinodermata, Xenoturbellaria  , Hemichordata, and Chordata. The split  between protostomes and deuterostomes has happened  in Precambrian time about 560 mya."
"The Echinodermata  are radially symmetric  animals at the adult stage. The radial symmetry of  body and nervous system appears to be secondary,  since echinoderms most probably derive from bilater ally symmetric ancestors, as is re fl ected by their bilat eral larva. The nervous system is composed of a  sensory ectoneural nerve ring of ectodermal origin sur rounding the mouth, and a motor hyponeural system of  mesodermal origin, from which radial nerves enter the  arms and the rest of the body coordinating the move ment of the animal."
"The connection between the two  systems is unclear. Hemichordates  are wormlike or sessile  marine animals with a primitive or secondarily  simpli fi ed nervous system consisting of a dorsal and  ventral nerve cord interpreted by some authors to be  homologous to the spinal cord of chordates, while oth ers consider it a result of independent evolution. The phylum Chordata consists of the Cephalochordata  , Urochordata , and Craniata ."
"They all possess, at least at some point of  their life, a chorda dorsalis or notochord, i. e. , a  fl exible  cartilaginous rod, and a hollow dorsal nerve or “spi nal” cord."
"Cephalochordates  possess  a neural plate, but no neural crest or placodes and, as a  consequence, no head. Recent studies based on neural  gene expression patterns  [  28  ]  reveal that the neural  tube and its rostral “cerebral vesicle” are homologous  with most parts of the vertebrate CNS, i. e."
", a spinal  cord, a rhombencephalon, mesencephalon, and dien cephalon and perhaps parts of a telencephalon, which  is connected with the unpaired frontal eye. Urochordates   are sessile animals having a free-swim ming larva and a very primitive nervous system, prob ably as a consequence of secondary simpli fi cation  related to their sessile life style. The group Craniata  com prises the Myxinoidea and all members of the subphy lum Vertebrata including the group Petromyzontida   ."
"Myxinoids and petromyzon tids have no jaws and are, therefore, often called  Agnatha, i. e. , jawless  fi shes."
Myxinoids  are eel-like  exoparasites with a well-developed olfactory and mech anosensory system – no lateral-line system as in all  other aquatic vertebrates – and have degenerated eyes. As shown in Fig. 2.
"12 , the subphylum Vertebrata com prises the classes Petromyzontida ,  Chondrichthyes ,  Osteichthyes , Amphibia ,  “Reptilia” , Aves  , and Mammalia . The former class “Reptilia” is now  considered a paraphyletic taxon, i. e."
", one without a  common ancestor, because crocodilians  are more closely related to birds  than to other “reptiles”. The representatives of the for mer class “Reptilia” and birds together form the super class Sauropsida. The class Mammalia comprises the three subclasses  Prototheria , Metatheria or  Marsupialia , and Eutheria or Placentalia ."
"According to recent taxon omy, the latter comprises the four supraorders  Afrotheria , Xenarthra , Euarchontoglires , and Laurasiatheria . The CNS of craniates reveals a highly uniform  organization  [  29, 30  ]  . In its  hypothetical ancestral form, it exhibits the “standard”  organization into the three: prosencephalon, mesen cephalon, and rhombencephalon."
"Whether such a tri partite organization, occurring in lophotrochozoans as  well as ecdysozoans, is due to “deep homology” found  in all bilaterians  [  11  ]  or to convergent evolution, is  debated. All extant craniates have brains consisting of  a rhombencephalon composed of a myelencephalon or  medulla oblongata, and a metencephalon including a  cerebellum, a mesencephalon  including an  isthmic region, and a prosencephalon composed of a  diencephalon  and a tel encephalon . Medulla oblongata and mesencephalon together  form the “brainstem”."
"It is now generally accepted that  most parts of the brain like the spinal cord have a  seg mental organization  . The rhombencepha lon consists of rhombomeres R1–7, the mesencephalon  is composed of an isthmic neuromer and a mesenceph alic neuromer proper, the diencephalon  and at least ventral parts of the telencephalon  are  segmented into six prosomeres P1–6. The exact seg mentation of the telencephalon dorsal and rostral to P6  into pallial and subpallial regions has yet to be  determined."
The  medulla spinalis  consists of an inner gray sub stance around the central canal consisting mostly of  nerve cells covered by white substance containing den drites and ascending and descending nerve  fi bers. The  gray substance is divided into a dorsal somatosensory  and viscerosensory region and a ventral visceromotor  and somatomotor region. Nerve cells innervate the  various parts of the body via spinal nerves in a seg mental fashion.
"The  medulla oblongata  reveals the same dorsoven tral organization as the medulla spinalis and contains,  in all vertebrates, from dorsal to ventral: somatosen sory, viscerosensory, visceromotor, and sensorimotor  areas and nuclei of the cranial nerves V to X. Tetrapod  vertebrates  also have the additional cranial nerves XI  and XII . The dorsal sen sory roots of the cranial nerves include ganglia con taining the somata of sensory neurons."
"The regions of  sensory nuclei may undergo strong enlargement and  complication, as, for instance, in gold fi sh with the gus tatory vagal lobe and its highly evolved gustatory sys tem. A mechano- and electroreceptive lateral-line  system associated with cranial nerves is present in all  vertebrates and was lost in some terrestrial amphibians  and in all amniotes, i. e."
", in “reptiles”, birds, and  mammals. The  reticular formation system  is found inside the  medulla oblongata, the pons , and in the tegmental midbrain. It is  relatively uniform among vertebrates and contains important neuromodulator-producing centers such as  the  noradrenergic  locus coeruleus  and the serotonergic  raphe  nuclei."
"The reticular formation controls centers  for breathing and cardiovascular activity and gives rise  to an ascending activation system for vigilance, aware ness, and consciousness. A  pons   is found  only in mammals and is situated in the rostral medulla  oblongata and caudal tegmentum. It contains relay  nuclei of  fi ber bundles that connect the cerebral cortex  and the cerebellum."
"However, similar pathways and  nuclei are likewise found in birds, but most likely  developed independently. The  cerebellum  is a formation of the dorsal meten cephalon and present in all vertebrates, but absent in  myxinoids, perhaps due to secondary loss. In all verte brates except petromyzontids, it exhibits a uniform  three-layered organization, i."
"e. , a deep small-celled  granular layer, a large-celled layer of Purkinje cells,  and a peripheral molecular layer. The vestibulolateral  lobes of the cerebellum processing primary vestibular  and – if present – mechano- and electroreceptive lat eral-line information are present in all vertebrates."
"A   corpus cerebelli  is found in cartilaginous and bony  f  i shes and terrestrial vertebrates and has undergone  hypertrophy in some groups of cartilaginous  fi shes,  and is strongly reduced in size in amphibians. In some  actinopterygian  fi shes, predominantly in electric  fi sh,  there is a strong enlargement of parts of the cerebel lum, the  valvula   [  34  ] . Mammals have novel lateral cer ebellar structures, the  cerebellar hemispheres , receiving  telencephalo-pontine input."
"Besides vestibular, soma tosensory, and sensorimotor functions, the cerebellum  of mammals, and perhaps of birds, is likewise involved  in “higher” cognitive functions such as thinking and  action planning as well as language in humans. The  mesencephalon  consists, from dorsal to ven tral, of the:  tectum  , the  torus semicircularis  , and the  tegmentum . In  all craniates, except mammals, the tectum is the major  visual processing and integration center."
"In its ances tral state, it exhibits a laminar organization consisting  of alternating cellular and  fi ber layers. The absence of  such lamination in some vertebrates such as salaman ders, caecilians, and South American and African  lung fi shes is a consequence of secondary simpli fi cation   [  35  ] . Besides visual input, other sensory information  such as auditory and – if present – mechano- and elec trosensory information originating in the torus semi circularis terminate in deeper layers of the tectum and  contribute to a multimodal representation for orienta tion in space."
"Likewise, telencephalic efferents termi nate in the tectum of cartilaginous and bony  fi shes and  of terrestrial vertebrates. Main tectal efferents descend  to the medulla oblongata/pons and medulla spinalis  . The  torus semicircularis  is, in its plesiomorphic  state, the midbrain relay station for auditory, mech ano-, and electrosensitive projections ascending to the  diencephalon and telencephalon ."
"Like  the tectum, it is characterized by a laminar organiza tion, which is most spectacular in electric  fi sh  [  29  ]   . The  tegmentum  is involved in motor functions  and exhibits a number of specialties. One ancient com ponent is the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve , which is absent in myxinoids, but present in  all vertebrates."
"In the tegmentum, massive  fi ber tracts  descending from the cortex to the pons, medulla oblon gata, and medulla spinalis are found . The tegmentum contains  the dopaminergic  substantia nigra  exhibiting recipro cal connections with the telencephalic striatum, and  the premotor  nucleus ruber . The latter receives crossed  efferents from the cerebellum and gives rise to crossed  descending motor tracts to the spinal cord ."
"The  diencephalon  is divided from dorsal to ventral  into the epithalamus, thalamus, and hypothalamus  . The  epithalamus  contains the  habenular  nuclei , which are important parts of the limbic system  and present in all craniates. They project, via the  fasciculus retro fl exus, to the midbrain tegmentum."
"In  many craniates, the epithalamus carries the pineal  organ or “epiphysis”, a small endocrine gland releasing  the hormone melatonin, which affects wake-sleep pat terns and seasonal functions. The  thalamus  is com posed of a dorsal and a ventral part and the posterior  tuberculum. In all craniates, the  dorsal thalamus  receives visual, somatosensory, auditory, and gustatory  information, either directly  or  indirectly via brainstem relay centers, and sends them  to telencephalic regions."
"Visual pathways terminate in  the dorsal pallium of  fi shes, amphibians, “reptiles”,  and birds and in the occipital cortex of mammals. In “reptiles” and birds, auditory as well as visual and  somatosensory pathways terminate in a special region  of the lateral telencephalon called  dorsal ventricular  ridge   in “reptiles” and  mesonidopallium  in  birds. The thalamus has undergone a strong enlarge ment in amniotes, particularly mammals and birds, and  became parcellated into many nuclei related to sensory,  cognitive, and motor as well as limbic functions."
"In  mammals , visual functions are relayed by  the corpus geniculatum laterale, auditory functions by  the corpus geniculatum mediale, both projecting to the  primary visual and auditory cortex, respectively. Ray f  i nned  fi shes have independently developed a projec tion from the posterior tuberculum of the diencephalon  to the pallium. The  ventral thalamus  and subthalamus   of mammals projects to telencephalic  parts of the basal ganglia, i."
"e. , corpus striatum and glo bus pallidus, and to the hippocampus. The  hypothala mus  and its appendage, the  pituitary  , are  the main hormone-based control centers for basal  homeostatic functions."
"Cartilaginous and bony  fi shes  exhibit a hypertrophy of the lateral hypothalamus  , with unknown  functions. The evolution of the  telencephalon  in craniates is  not fully understood. In all craniates, it receives olfac tory information from the olfactory bulb as the only  direct sensory input."
"Comparative neuroanatomists,  therefore, previously believed that in its ancestral state  the telencephalon had to be considered the “olfactory  brain”. Later it was found that in all craniates the telencephalon also receives information from other  senses, e. g."
", visual, auditory, and mechanosensory via  pathways ascending from the diencephalon ,  and the telencephalon was regarded “multimodal” in  its ancestral state. Recent studies, however, revealed  that in all craniates except birds and mammals these  nonolfactory sensory afferents to the telencephalon are  either multimodal or do not form topographic repre sentations. This would imply that the development of  topographic representations of thalamic sensory affer ents to pallial/cortical regions has happened indepen dently in birds and mammals and would again  strengthen the “olfactory brain” interpretation."
"The telencephalon of all craniates is composed of  a pallium and a ventral subpallium  surrounding the paired telencephalic ven tricles, which in its ancestral form of tetrapods is  clearly visible in the amphibian brain . With the exception of petromyzontids, the  pallium is divided into a medial, dorsal, lateral, and  ventral pallium, and the subpallium into a septal and a  striato-pallidal region, the latter including parts of the  amygdala involved in limbic-autonomic functions . In “reptiles”, pal lial divisions are called medial, dorsal, and lateral  cortex and dorsal ventricular ridge ."
"The  medial pallium/cortex of amphibians and sauropsids  corresponds to the hippocampal formation of mam mals, the lateral pallium to the olfactory  cortex, and the ventral pallium to the  vomeronasal pallium. The ontogeny of the telencephalon of actinoptery gian   fi shes deviates from that of other cra niates  [  34  ] ; Fig. 2."
"19 . In the latter, the unpaired  embryonic telencephalon extends laterally and forms  two hemispheres through  evagination  resulting in an  arrangement of a medial, dorsal, lateral, and ventral  pallium, and a subpallium around the ventricles. In contrast, in actinopterygians two hemispheres are  formed by  eversion  in such a way that parts of the brain  which in the evagination type are found medially and  dorsally, occupy a ventrolateral position."
"These differ ences in ontogeny contribute to the dif fi culty with  homologizing parts of the telencephalon of actinop terygian  fi shes and other vertebrates. In sauropsids, the lateral parts of the pallium have  developed into a large structure, the  dorsal ventricular  ridge , DVR, which bulges in medial direction into  the ventricles and for a long time was considered part  of the corpus striatum as the major telencephalic  component of the basal ganglia . Accordingly,  parts of the DVR of birds were called e ctostriatum ,   neostriatum , and  hyperstriatum ."
"Today it is generally  accepted that the DVR is not homologous to the stria tum, but is of pallial origin  [  37  ] . However, as illustrated in Fig. 2."
"21 , there is a debate  whether the DVR and the mesonidopallium of birds  are homologous to the lateral cortex or the claustrum  of mammals and ventral pallium of amphibians  [  38,  39  ] . In the latter case, different parts of the dorsal tel encephalon would give rise to centers involved in intel ligence and other mental abilities . The dorsal pallium of myxinoids exhibits a  f  i ve-layered structure, which has developed inde pendently of other lamination patterns found in crani ates ."
"The pallium of cartilaginous and  actinopterygian  fi shes is unlaminated. The medial and  dorsal pallium of lung fi shes  displays some  lamination, while the pallium of amphibians is gener ally unlaminated despite extensive cell migration in  medial and dorsal parts  [  29  ] ; cf. Fig."
"2. 18a, b . In the  medial, dorsomedial, and dorsal cortex of “reptiles”  there is a three- to four-fold lamination, which how ever, is discontinuous and not comparable in its cyto architecture to the laminated cortex of mammals ."
"In birds, the dorsally situated hyperpallium  is considered homologous to the visual, auditory, and  somatosensory cortex of mammals, while the meso-/  nidopallium of birds is considered to be homologous  either to the lateral  isocortex or a derivative  of the ventral pallium of amphibian-reptilian ances tors. In birds, both the hyperpallium and meso-/nidop allium are unlaminated . Mammals in general possess a six-layered cortex  called “isocortex”  and a 3- to 5-layered  “allocortex” or limbic cortex."
"The evolution of the  mammalian cortex is unclear, but its laminar organiza tion appears to have evolved independently of the lam ination occurring in the pallia of other craniates and  probably evolved from a three-layered olfactory cor tex. A common organizational principle of the mam malian cortex is the parcellation into functionally  different  areas. In small  mammalian brains, the number of such areas is low,  having about 10 primary sensory and motor areas  without signs of integrative-associative areas; cf."
"[  41  ] . The number of cortical areas increases with cortex vol ume in most mammals and all primates. Concurrently,  the relative sizes of cortical areas are supposed to  decrease."
"The human cortex is assumed to possess 150  areas and 60 connections per area resulting in 9,000  area-area connections  [  42  ] . The subpallium/subcortex of vertebrates consists  of a large striatopallidum  as the  main component of the basal ganglia, a subcortical  amygdalar complex, and a medially situated septal  region. The amygdala of vertebrates consists of a  portion exerting autonomic-limbic functions  as well as olfactory and vomerona sal functions ."
"In addition, in mammals a  basolateral amygdala has evolved, with strong recip rocal connections to the isocortex and limbic cortex  as well as afferents from the sensory nuclei of the  thalamus. The basic organization of the brain is surprisingly uni form across all vertebrate taxa, as described above. Besides the development of structures for the process ing of specialized senses such as the vagal and facial  lobe  or the valvula cerebelli   in teleost  fi shes, major changes are observed in the tel encephalic roof, i."
"e. , pallium or cortex. However, one  of the most striking differences concerns absolute  brain size , which in vertebrates varies from  1 mg  in miniaturized  fi shes and amphibians  up to 8,000 g in the false killer whale, which is a range  of almost seven orders of magnitude ."
"The classes of craniates likewise differ markedly in  brain size relative to body size  . The  smallest RBS is found in agnathans , followed by bony  fi shes, amphibians,  “reptiles”, and cartilaginous  fi shes, the latter having  surprisingly large brains. Mammals and birds, on aver age, have brains that are about ten times larger than  those of the other groups of craniates of the same body  size."
"In birds, parrots  and corvids   have 6–10 times larger brains than other  birds. Among mammals, primates  generally have larger brains than the  other orders with the same body size. In primates, pro simians and tarsiers have relatively small brains with  an average of 6."
"7 g, followed by New World monkeys  with an average of 45 g and Old World monkeys at an  average of 115 g, with the largest monkey brains found  in baboons. Among apes, gibbons have brain sizes   which fall within the range of Old World  monkeys, while the large apes  have brain weights between 330 and  570 g   [  47  ] . Brain size in vertebrates is mostly determined  by body size  [  48  ] ."
"However, brain size does  not increase proportionally with body size, but “lags  behind”, i. e. , with an exponent  of 0."
"6–0. 8, which is due to the fact that  with an increase in body size brains become absolutely  larger, but relatively smaller – this is called  negative  brain allometry   [  44  ] . As a consequence, in small mice  or insectivores brain volume may constitute 10 % or  more of body volume, while in the blue whale, the  largest living animal, the brain makes up only 0."
"01 %  or even less of body mass  [  49  ] ; . Primates,  in general, have higher RBS than all other groups of  mammals. The human brain has a weight of 1,250–1,450 g on  average and represents about 2 % of body mass."
"Although the human brain is neither exceptional in  ABS or RBS, it is unusually large in terms of body  size. This can be demonstrated using various statistical  methods, e. g."
", the encephalization quotient EQ, which  indicates the extent to which the brain size of a given  species  Ea   deviates from the expected brain size  Ee  ;cf. [  44  ] . Within primates, humans have the highest EQ of  7."
"4–7. 8, meaning that the human brain is 7–8 times  larger than that of an average mammal of the same  body size . They are followed by the mon keys  Cebus  and  Saimiri  with EQs of 4."
"8 and 2. 8,  respectively, while chimpanzees and orangutans have  low  and gorillas very low  EQs . Other mammals have EQs between 0."
"4   and 1. 3 . During mammalian brain evolution, all parts  increased in size relative to the body, except the olfac tory system."
"However, the telencephalon as well as the  cerebellum underwent a faster growth than the other  parts resulting in  positive allometry  . Inside the telencephalon,  the cortex has grown faster both in surface and thick ness. However, while the increase in surface was  10,000-fold , cortical thickness increased  only slightly, from 0."
"5 mm in mice to 3 mm in  Homo  sapiens . Interestingly, mammals with much larger  brains and consequently cortical surfaces such as ele phants and cetaceans  have  unusually thin cortices of 1. 5 and 1 mm, respectively."
"In all mammalian cortices, cortical cell density  decreases with increasing cortex volume, but primates  in general have higher densities  than expected compared to other mammals – elephants and cetaceans have the lowest cortical cell  densities . Humans com bine a relatively large brain, a very thick cortex with a  relatively high cortical cellular density  which results in the fact that they have  considerably more cortical neurons   than elephants and cetaceans with their much bigger  brains , which is the  highest number of cortical neurons found in animals   [  51, 52  ] . The earliest human-like primates, the australopith ecines   existed in East Africa at about 3–4 mya and had a  brain volume of 400–450 cm 3 , which is equal to or  only slightly larger than that of present chimpanzees  ."
A strong increase in brain volume  occurred only with the appearance of  Homo habilis  about 2 mya having 700 cm 3 . This means that brain  size of our ancestors remained constant for 1. 5 mya  despite strong environmental changes.
"The next  strong increase in brain size occurred 1. 8 mya with  the appearance of  Homo erectus , who had a brain  volume of 800–1,000 cm 3 . The appearance of early  forms of  Homo sapiens  about 400,000 years ago with  brain volumes between 1,100 and 1,500 cm 3  repre sents the latest step of brain evolution in hominins."
"Importantly, not  Homo sapiens , but  Homo neander thalensis , with 1,400–1,900 cm 3  had the largest brain  of all hominins and primates. The reasons for this  dramatic increase in brain size in a relatively short  evolutionary time are unclear despite a large number  of scenarios. In humans, intelligence is commonly de fi ned as men tal capacities such as abstract thinking, understand ing, communication, reasoning, learning, and memory  formation, action planning, and problem solving   [  51  ] ."
"Usually, human intelligence is measured by  intelligence tests and expressed in intelligence quo tient  values expressing different contents . Evidently, such a  de fi nition and measurement of intelligence cannot be  applied directly to nonhuman animals, because any  test depending on verbalization is inapplicable. A  number of comparative and evolutionary psycholo gists and cognitive ecologists converge on the view  that mental or behavioral   fl exibility  is a good measure  of intelligence culminating in the appearance of novel  solutions not part of the animal’s normal repertoire   [  53, 54  ] ."
"Intelligence de fi ned in such a manner has developed  several times independently during evolution, e. g. , in  cephalopods , social insects , some teleost  fi shes , some  birds , and mammals."
"In all these  cases, high intelligence is coupled with  larger to  much larger brains as compared to less intelligent  members of the respective taxon,  specialized brain centers with a high number of densely packed and  interconnected neurons, and  structures and mecha nisms for fast information processing, e. g. , the vertical  and subvertical lobe of  Octopus , the mushroom bodies  in the honeybee, the mesonidopallium of corvids, and  the isocortex of primates."
"Primates are, on average,  more intelligent than other mammals and all other ani mals, with the great apes and  fi nally humans at the far  end. Because of higher relative cortex volume and  higher neuron packing density , primates have  considerably more cortical neurons than other mam mals of the same brain size. Likewise, information pro cessing capacity  is generally higher in primates  due to short interneuronal distance and high axon con duction velocity."
"Finally, primate cortices exhibit  extensive parcellation according to the principle of  intense local and sparse global connectivity  [  52  ] . Across taxa, differences in intelligence correlates  best with differences in number of pallial or cortical  neurons and synapses plus processing speed. The  human brain combines large cortical volume with  reasonable NPD, high conduction velocity, and high  cortical parcellation."
"Cetaceans and elephants have  much larger brains than even humans, but less cortical  neurons, because of much lower NPD. This could  explain why cetaceans and elephants are not as intel ligent as one would expect on the basis of brain size. The contrary is the case for corvid birds with very  small brains, but high NPD and IPC, which could  explain why these animals reveal an intelligence com parable to primates with much larger brains."
"All aspects  of human intelligence are present at least in principle  in nonhuman primates and in some other mammals  and more distant vertebrates – except syntactical lan guage. The latter can be regarded as a very potent  “intelligence amplifier”. An unsolved question in the study of evolution, in gen eral, and of nervous systems and brains, in particular,  is the question whether the strikingly numerous cases  of similar structures found in sense organs and brains  are the result of true convergent evolution   or of the action of “deep” homologies ."
"Striking examples for convergent evolution in the tra ditional sense are the lens eye of  Octopus  and of verte brates; the paired “ladder”-type ventral nerve cord of  annelids and arthropods; and the tripartite brain in  polychetes, arthropods, and   craniates, among others. The concept of “deep homologies” attempts to  describe the role of very ancient genetic mechanisms  governing growth and differentiation processes in  metazoans  [  11  ] . This includes so-called  homeotic  genes  that control the differentiation of organisms  along their body axes, of sense organs, and nervous  systems and brains."
"They are found to be the same in  very distantly related animals such as the fruit  fl y  Drosophila  and the clawed toad  Xenopus . In  Drosophila   the formation of the ven tral cords and the tritocerebrum, and in  Xenopus   the develop ment of the spinal cord and myelencephalon, is con trolled by  Hox  genes. On the other hand, non Hox  genes   determine the formation of the proto- and  deutocerebrum of insects and of the mes-, di-, and met encephalon in chordates."
"The zone in between these  regions, the tritocerebrum in insects and the isthmic  region in vertebrates, is controlled by so-called  Pax  genes in both groups  [  55  ] . These  findings could now   be extended to all bilaterians and even to phyla having  lost their bilateral organization in the adult stage , which leads to the assumption that all bilat erally organized animals possess a common “bauplan”  for a tripartite brain since about 600 mya  [  11  ] . Precursors of such genes have been found even in coel enterates and sponges."
"Such a new concept radically simpli fi es many prob lems concerning the evolution of nervous systems and  brains, e. g. , explaining the large number of seemingly  “convergent” or “homoplastic” steps in the evolution  of neural and sensory structures, because they appear  to be based on the same regulatory developmental  genes – this, however, leads to new problems, because  an uncountable number of cases of secondary  simpli fi cation have to be assumed."
"Even if there is a  “deep” homology of such genes, the parts of the ner vous systems and brains controlled by them may have  developed independently, and the same or very similar  developmental genes may have undergone a change in  function. Furthermore, it is still unclear how the same  regulatory genes can lead to very different structures. Insect and vertebrate brains have hardly any resem blance, and the same is true for the insect compound  eye and the vertebrate lens eye, despite similar regula tory genes."
"These may represent basic organizational  commands such as “form a tripartite brain!” or “develop  a light-sensitive organ!”, and it is left up to epigenetic   mechanisms to form  a pigment spot, a compound eye, or a lens eye. At the level of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes we  already  fi nd a fundamental division into sensorium and  motorium, with some sort of information processing in  between, which involves a short-term memory and rep resents the basic organization of “cognitive” functions. In the earliest eumetazoans diffuse “basi-epithelial”  nerve nets exist similar to that found in  Hydra ."
"From  there, two major evolutionary trends took their course. The  fi rst represents a sidetrack leading to the evolution  of ring-shaped nerve systems in cnidarians and cteno phorans , the other is the main track  leading to a bilaterally organized nervous system with  a circumesophageal ganglion and ventral cords having  originated already in Precambrian times 560 mya or  earlier. Even planarians feature such a CNS, and at this  level all extant neuronal mechanisms  were  already present."
"Interestingly, both “coelenterates” and  bilateral organisms possess very similar genes control ling the body plan – including the brain. From the CNS of the most primitive bilaterally sym metric animals , again two major evolu tionary trends originated – one in the protostomes, the  other in the deuterostomes. The former split into two  evolutionary lineages: the lophotrochozoan and the  ecdysozoan schemes – in both lines we  fi nd the  formation  of complex sense organs and brains."
"Among lophotro chozoans, this is the case for predatory platyhelminths,  polychaetes, and likewise predatory cephalopods. Here  we  fi nd complex lens eyes and visual systems as well as  a multilobed supraesophageal ganglia, and the brain of  Octopus  is regarded the most complex protostome brain. Among ecdysozoans, arthropods likewise exhibit highly  complex sense organs and brains, and those of the  fl ies  and hymenopterans  are considered  the most complex ones."
"The deuterostomes, with an  unresolved phylogenetic origin, likewise exhibit two  major developmental lineages, one leading to the  Echinodermata with radially symmetric adult nervous  systems super fi cially resembling those of the “coelen terates”; the other line leading via hemi-, uro-, and  cephalochordates – all with very simple nervous sys tems – to the craniates and eventually to the vertebrates. The vertebrate brain evolved very early   and since then remained relatively uniform in its basic  organization. Major evolutionary changes concerned  the specialization, complication, and enlargement   of the different brain regions and  formation of novel sensory systems such as gustatory,  electroreceptive, infrared, echolocation, and visual sys tems."
"The most dramatic changes occurred in the dorsal  telencephalon  together with related  changes in the dorsal thalamus projecting to this  structure. Birds and, independently, mammals evolved uni modal afferents to the pallium-cortex – in birds mostly  to the dorsal ventricular ridge and in mammals to the  isocortex forming topographically organized sensory  and motor areas. In birds as well as in mammals there  is a dramatic increase in brain size and in the size of  the pallium and isocortex, in particular."
"Among birds  the largest brains are found in psittacids and corvids and among mammals the largest brains occur in pri mates  and this  correlates roughly with the degree of cognitive abili ties such as learning, problem solving, use and fabrica tion of tools, imitation, insight, thinking, action  planning, and language. Humans have the largest brain  of all animals  and in addition  they have the largest number of cortical neurons as  well as the most ef fi cient information-processing  capacities among large-brained animals and so far  appear to be the only lifeform with a grammatically  and syntactically structured language."
